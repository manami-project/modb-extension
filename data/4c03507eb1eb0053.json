    "text": "Agricultural life is a far cry from the urban jungle, a reality that Yuugo Hachiken discovers firsthand when he enrolls in Oezo Agricultural High School in an attempt to escape his stressful city life and demanding parents. Raised in a world of convenience and comfort, Hachiken is thrust into a realm of early mornings, physical labor, and farm animals, a stark contrast to his previous academic pursuits.\n\nSurrounded by classmates who have grown up on farms and possess an innate understanding of the agricultural world, Hachiken finds himself struggling to keep up. Despite his academic prowess, he is no match for the practical knowledge and skills of his peers. However, amidst the challenges and hardships, Hachiken forms bonds with his classmates, learns about the realities of farm life, and even finds himself drawn to the equestrian club and a fellow student named Aki Mikage.\n\nAs Hachiken navigates this unfamiliar world, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery, learning not only about agriculture but also about himself and his dreams for the future. Will he be able to adapt to this new environment and find his place in the world of farming? Join Hachiken on his comedic and heartwarming journey as he seeks to find his own path in life.",
