    "text": "Seven sacred pillars connect the human and demon realms, converging in the bustling town of Sakurashin, where both entities coexist harmoniously. To maintain this delicate balance, the Hiizumi Life Counseling Office stands vigilant, staffed by four extraordinary teenagers with unique abilities. Among them is Ao, a mind-reading, cat-eared enigma; Hime, a stunningly powerful individual; Kotoha, a conjurer capable of summoning anything with a mere utterance; and Akina, the sole human, gifted with the power to expel malevolent demon souls. Together, they safeguard the town, supporting newcomers and quelling the sporadic Strikes, a phenomenon where humans are inexplicably imbued with demonic powers, causing chaos. As political adversaries and ominous forces gather, the Hiizumi Life Counseling Office must rise to the challenge, defending their cherished town and preserving harmony between humans and demons.",
