    "text": "The life of nine-year-old Melmo takes a tragic turn when she loses her mother in a car accident, leaving her responsible for her two younger siblings. In an extraordinary twist, her mother's ghost appears to aid Melmo, bestowing her with a magical gift - a jar of enchanted candies. These candies possess the power to age her by ten years or rejuvenate her, and when used together, can even transform her into any animal she can imagine. With these miraculous sweets, Melmo navigates the challenges of caring for her siblings while maintaining a semblance of a normal childhood, often finding herself in unique situations that test her wit and resilience.",
