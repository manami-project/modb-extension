  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dejiko is now a 20-year-old woman working part-time at a bakery shop. On Christmas Eve, she has a chance encounter with a young man named Senba Takuo when she slips and drops her cake in the park. Takuo kindly replaces her spoiled cake with his own. Over the next year, Dejiko and Takuo continue to cross paths and gradually develop deeper feelings for one another. However, complications arise when Dejiko receives a letter from her distant mother requesting her to return home, and she also sees Takuo with another woman. Dejiko must decide whether to pursue her nascent relationship with Takuo or leave it all behind. Throughout this emotional journey, Dejiko's younger sister Puchiko remains a steadfast source of support. Ultimately, Dejiko must choose between staying or going, between new love or family obligation.",
