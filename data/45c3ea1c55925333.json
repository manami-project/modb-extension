  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Lina Inverse, the world's greatest sorceress, and her fearless but clumsy companion, Gourry, venture to the quaint seaside town of Acassi, they're in for more than just a taste of the local delicacy â€” octopus tentacle. Little do they know, consuming the octopus comes with a dangerous side effect: a curse that leaves the eater communicating only in Takogo, the language of the octopuses.\n\nAs the duo unwittingly becomes entangled in a sinister octopus conspiracy, they're joined by familiar faces Amelia, Zelgadis, and Xellos. Together, they find themselves cursed and on a mission to put an end to the malevolent octopus clan's plot to eradicate humans once and for all.\n\nWith the town's fate hanging in the balance, it's up to the white sorceress Ruma to learn the cure to the curse from her estranged master. Can Lina, Gourry, and their friends restore the power of speech to the masses and save Acassi from the depths of the octopuses' wrath? Only time will tell in this thrilling and comedic adventure.",
