  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The stage is set in a dystopian 21st-century Tokyo, where a mysterious calamity has transformed the bustling Shinjuku ward into an uninhabited wasteland. In this desolate landscape, peculiar creatures roam, a blend of animals and pastries - enter Donyatsu, a charming half-cat, half-chocolate-coated donut entity. Alongside Donyatsu are other quirky companions like Begaru, a feline-bagel fusion, Ronya, and Baumcougar, among others. Despite the grim backdrop, these unique beings find joy in everyday activities, engaging in games like shiritori, catch, and concentration, offering a heartwarming spectacle of camaraderie and resilience in a post-apocalyptic world. This loosely science-fiction adventure promises a delightful blend of humor and oddity, introducing a host of never-before-seen characters that add to its intrigue.",
