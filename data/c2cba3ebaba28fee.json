She was tutored in the art of swordplay from a young age by her grandfather Jii-chan, once a famous swordsman himself. However, Jii-chan now works as a humble chimney sweep in the magical city of Varanoir. Seeking to further her training, Myuu enrolls in Varanoir's legendary magic university, said to produce the land's strongest warriors. She hopes to hone her skills and one day make her grandfather proud by living up to his storied legacy. However, Myuu's student life gets off to a rocky start when she quickly makes a rival of Ryuuto, a talented, beautiful student who sees Myuu as a threat. With the university training students to defend the land from an impending demon invasion, Myuu will have to prove herself against her fellow classmates to secure her place there. Will Myuu rise to the challenge and save the kingdom by becoming the great swordswoman she dreams of being? Or will her rival Ryuuto outshine her and put an end to Myuu's student life ambitions?
