    "text": "Tada Banri, a freshman at a prestigious law school in Tokyo, finds himself navigating the complexities of college life with no recollection of his past due to an unfortunate accident. While attempting to locate the freshman orientation, he crosses paths with fellow newcomer, Mitsuo Yanagisawa, and the two form an instant bond. Just as they begin to adapt to their new surroundings, the stunning Kouko Kaga enters the scene, turning their world upside down.\n\nKouko, a childhood friend of Mitsuo, had promised to marry him when they were young, prompting Mitsuo to secretly enroll in the law school in an attempt to escape her grasp. However, fate had other plans, as Kouko also passed the entrance exam, reuniting the pair and leaving Mitsuo under her influence once more.\n\nAs Banri and Mitsuo forge ahead in their new lives, they are confronted with the challenges of college, love, and the consequences of past decisions. With no memories to guide him, Banri must discover who he once was and choose the path that will lead him to a brighter future. Will he find happiness, or will his past catch up to him, leaving him with yet another memory to forget? Only time will tell as these three intertwined souls embark on a journey of self-discovery, love, and the unpredictable nature of fate.",
