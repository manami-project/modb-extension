  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It'll be a splash for our daring explorers, Bell, Hestia, Lilly, and the rest of the crew, as they conquer the daunting 18th level of the world's most formidable dungeon! With no theme parks in the city of Orario, they opt for the next best thing: a relaxing hot springs getaway. Lo and behold, a skirmish with hellhounds reveals a hidden underground paradise! But all is not as it seems in this subterranean haven, as an air of mystery surrounds the springs â€“ and the perfectly-sized bathing suits Hermes just happens to have on hand. Will our heroes uncover the truth before it's too late? Will Hestia finally bare her soul to Bell? The answers surface as they dive into the question: IS IT WRONG TO EXPECT A HOT SPRING IN A DUNGEON?!",
