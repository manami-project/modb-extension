  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime captures a fleeting yet familiar moment - that magical time between when play ends and dinnertime begins. As the five o'clock chime signals the end of playtime, there follows an indefinable period where carefree enjoyment gives way to thoughts of home and the comforts that await. Though transient, these transitions from play to domesticity are etched into memory, evocative moments that connect children across generations. With warmth and whimsy, this 2013 animation from film student Saki Muramoto explores the timeless experience of being called home at day's end. Her graduate piece renders the liminal space between playground and family table, freezing a universal childhood ritual to touch audiences with pangs of reminiscence.",
