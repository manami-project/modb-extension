    "text": "Special episode of the anime \"Uchi no Mama ni Kagitte\" takes us on a delightful journey as Masamune Makabe returns home to find his cousin Haruka, whom he initially mistakes for his mother due to their uncanny resemblance. Seizing the opportunity, Masamune's sister Chinatsu encourages Haruka, their mother, and Aunt Asae to dress up and have some fun. Meanwhile, Masamune's friends are invited back to Tsunade Island for another summer getaway, but Masamune's absence due to an injury evokes mixed emotions among the group. Yoshino Koiwai, who has been working tirelessly as a maid, receives a day off and undergoes a makeover with her sister's help. As she enjoys her newfound freedom, Yoshino discovers that there are other fulfilling ways to find happiness beyond her usual duties. This heartwarming after-story of the manga is sure to leave you with a sense of joy and satisfaction.",
