  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tsuna was looking forward to a normal school trip with his crush Kyoko, but his infant tutor Reborn had other plans. As the organizer of the trip, Reborn transforms it into a chaotic two-day Vongola-style adventure across Japan. The group visits numerous tourist destinations like castles and zoos. However, with Reborn in charge, no activity is ordinary - whether it's climbing castle walls or riding flying buses. Tsuna struggles to survive the trip as one mishap after another threatens to ruin his long-awaited time with Kyoko. Initially released as a special online episode, this comedic spin-off features the characters from popular anime Katekyo Hitman Reborn. Extra scenes were later added when it was made available on DVD. This over-the-top travelogue showcases the cast while spotlighting real Japanese locales that fans may one day wish to visit.",
