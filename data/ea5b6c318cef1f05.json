    "text": "Minori's latest work, Ourin Academy, once a tranquil learning haven, has been thrust into chaos and turmoil following an unexpected coup d'Ã©tat. The mastermind behind this rebellion is none other than the enigmatic Kusunoki-sensei, a subheroine who has managed to sway most of the student body to her cause. With the principal overthrown, the responsibility to restore peace and order falls upon the shoulders of three unlikely heroes: Yuu Sakurano, Yuzuki Kaede, and Nagomi Fujikura.\n\nAs these three brave girls embark on their mission to reclaim their school, they encounter a motley crew of classmates who, inexplicably, stand in their way. In this unprecedented war, the halls of Ourin Academy echo with the clashes of makeshift weapons and the resounding determination of its students.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, Yuu, Yuzuki, and Nagomi must navigate through a labyrinth of flying attacks and sinister plots, all in an effort to return their beloved school to its former glory. Will they be able to wrest control back from Kusunoki-sensei and her followers, or will Ourin Academy remain in the clutches of this mysterious usurper? Join these courageous girls in their thrilling quest to restore peace and uncover the truth behind this unexpected rebellion!",
