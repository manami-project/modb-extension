  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Grace a world thousands of years ahead, where humans are believed to be an ancient myth, and robots have inherited the Earth. In the sprawling city of Eden 3, two diligent farming robots, A37 and E92, carry on their duties, maintaining the lush apple orchards. One day, they stumble upon a hidden secret that shatters their beliefsâ€”a human baby girl, Sara Grace, preserved in a survival capsule.\n\nDespite the robots' programming to avoid human contact, A37 and E92 form an unbreakable bond with Sara, becoming her surrogate parents. Fearing the wrath of Zero, the leader of Eden 3 who views humans as dangerous, the trio escapes to a sanctuary for free-thinking robots. As Sara grows into a curious young woman, she yearns to learn about her origins, leading her back to Eden 3.\n\nSara's return ignites a conflict with Zero and his security robots, but she uncovers a shocking revelation: 35,000 humans were placed in cryo-sleep and must soon be awakened. With Zero determined to prevent their revival, the stage is set for a battle that will determine the fate of humanity and the robotic society that thrived in its absence.",
