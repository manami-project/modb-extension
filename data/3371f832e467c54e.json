    "text": "Castilia Arago Forland, the princess of the kingdom of Forland, finds herself in the midst of a coup d'Ã©tat orchestrated by the treacherous court scientist, Dr. Akamashi. As her father, the king, breathes his last, he urges her to escape and find her brother, Prince Kaito. While fleeing, Alita crosses paths with Falis, a ruthless bounty hunter accompanied by her monstrous sidekicks, Dominikov and Pete. A fateful encounter leads to the two women swapping bodies, with Alita now in Falis's form and vice versa. In a desperate bid to reclaim her kingdom and ensure her safety, Alita pleads with Falis to return to the castle and pose as the princess. Falis, now inhabiting Alita's body, agrees to this arrangement, thus giving rise to the formidable Murder Princess. As the new princess struggles to maintain order and uncover the conspiracy that plagues the kingdom, Alita must navigate her new life as a bounty hunter while ensuring Falis's success in reclaiming her rightful place. The future of Forland hangs in the balance as the Murder Princess fights to protect her kingdom and unravel the sinister plot that threatens its very existence.",
