He's never found anything that holds his interest for long, until his childhood friend introduces him to \"Dragon Drive,\" a virtual reality game that changes everything. In this game, players are paired with dragons that reflect their personalities and strengths. Reiji dreams of a mighty beast, but instead, he's matched with Chibi, a small, seemingly unimpressive dragon. However, Chibi is no ordinary dragon; he's the rarest of them all, capable of developing unique powers.\n\nAs Reiji finds himself captivated by the game, he commits to training Chibi, discovering a newfound dedication within himself. But \"Dragon Drive\" isn't just a game. During a special training session, Reiji and his friends are transported to a strange world, where they learn that the fate of the dragons and humanity rests in their hands. As Reiji navigates this new reality, he must harness the power of his bond with Chibi to protect both worlds from the sinister forces lurking within the game. Get ready for an exciting adventure filled with friendship, courage, and high-stakes battles in \"Dragon Drive.\"",
