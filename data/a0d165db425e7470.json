  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This animated short explores the Japanese proverb that \"hair is the heart of a woman.\" It is a 60-second film directed by Kazuto Nakazawa, known for his animation work on Kill Bill: Vol. 1. The visual style is inspired by 18th century Japanese paintings, with expressive brushwork used to outline the characters. The animation was done entirely by hand, without 3D support, to capture the unique pencil-on-paper look. The story concept uses hair as a metaphor for feminine life. It focuses on a tragic love story in a samurai drama style. A young man secretly climbs up to meet his lover using her hair as a rope. However, when her father forbids them from seeing each other again, they face heartbreak, just as if her \"heart\" itself were severed. This dramatic tale brings a traditional Japanese proverb to life through stunning animation and emotional storytelling. Directed by an internationally renowned artist, it promises beautiful imagery and a gripping romance.",
