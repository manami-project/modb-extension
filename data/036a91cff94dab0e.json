  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This poignant anime explores the complex relationship between a mother and daughter. When the mother secretly discards her daughter's letter in the frigid, snow-blanketed ocean, it triggers suspicion and mistrust. Seeking answers, the daughter trails her mom and covertly boards the same small vessel. As the two sit amidst the silent, frozen seascape, unspoken emotions hang heavy in the air. Through subtle visual storytelling, the anime reveals a connection frayed by poor communication but still bound by unconditional love. Will the ice thaw, opening the door for healing? This contemplative short anime was Satomi Maiyaâ€™s graduate project at Tokyo University of the Arts.",
