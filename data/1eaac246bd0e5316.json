    "text": "As a young prince in a world where cultivation is everything, Qin Yu is faced with an insurmountable challenge: he lacks the innate ability to cultivate internally. Refusing to succumb to despair, he chooses the arduous path of external cultivation, honing his physical body instead. Living in isolation with his grandfather, Qin Yu is gifted an unusual bird, Xiao Hei, which becomes his steadfast companion.\n\nDetermined to earn his father's recognition, Qin Yu undergoes rigorous training under Zhao Yunxing, striving to overcome his physical limitations. During a break from his training, he discovers a mysterious red crystal that merges with his body, triggering an unexpected transformation.\n\nUnbeknownst to Qin Yu, this enigmatic crystal—the Meteoric Tear—grants him extraordinary abilities, altering the course of his life. As he embarks on a journey to prove his worth, accompanied by Xiao Hei, he soon becomes a force to be reckoned with. With his newfound power, Qin Yu sets out to demonstrate that he is not only capable but also deserving of his father's acknowledgement, revealing a world of untapped potential and hidden strength.",
