    "text": "In the late 20th century, humanity discovers they are not alone on Earth when giant monsters called Kaiju and the infamous Godzilla emerge. For the next half century, humans wage war against the Kaiju but face continuous defeat. By 2048, the remaining humans flee Earth on an interstellar ship called the Aratrum, heading towards Tau Cetus e over 11 lightyears away. On board is Haruo, who watched his parents die at the hands of Godzilla as a child. For 20 years he nurses a burning hatred for Godzilla and a desire to return to Earth to defeat the monster. However, when the Aratrum arrives at Tau Cetus e after a 20 year journey, the planet's environment is found to be completely inhospitable for human life. As conditions deteriorate on the ship, Haruo leads a group called the Earth Returnists in using dangerous experimental technology to return to Earth across vast distances of hyperspace. But when they finally arrive after 20,000 years have passed, Earth has become an alien world dominated by Godzilla and other monsters in an unrecognizable ecosystem. Despite the unknown threats, Haruo is determined to reclaim humanity's homeworld and exact his long-awaited revenge against Godzilla. The fate of the last humans and Earth itself now hangs in the balance.",
