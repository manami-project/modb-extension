  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Erika is a high school student who lies to her friends about having a boyfriend in order to gain their approval. In a moment of panic, she shows them a photo of a random stranger, Kyouya, claiming he is her boyfriend. Unbeknownst to Erika, Kyouya actually attends her school. When he discovers her lie, the seemingly kind Kyouya reveals his true sadistic nature and blackmails Erika into becoming his personal \"dog\" - obeying his every command and treating her like a pet - in exchange for keeping her secret. Though initially appalled, Erika agrees to Kyouya's terms to avoid humiliation. As time passes, she catches glimpses of Kyouya's complexity beneath his cruel facade. At the same time, Erika finds herself developing real feelings for her \"master.\" She wonders if the ruthless boy who has her leash will ever reciprocate, or if she is destined to be Kyouya's \"wolf girl\" indefinitely. This unusual relationship sets the stage for an eccentric romantic comedy drama.",
