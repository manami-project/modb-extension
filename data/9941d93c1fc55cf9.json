    "text": "After defeating numerous opponents in the Holy Grail War and ascending through six floors, Hakuno Kishinami arrives at the top floor with his Servant Nero. There they encounter Sir Gawain, a Knight of the Round Table who serves his master Leonardo B. Harwey - the strongest Master in the war's history. Gawain informs them that to proceed, they must defeat the slumbering Harwey. Awakened to battle, Harwey proves a formidable foe as the strongest of King Arthur's knights. Hakuno and Nero engage in an intense duel against Harwey and Gawain, striving to prevail and continue their quest to fix the defective Holy Grail War system. With time running out, the final battle will determine the fate of the Moon Cell and humanity's future. Though Hakuno's memories remain lost, his resolve is firm - to end this endless cycle of violence between Masters and Servants. Bonded with the steadfast Nero, he fights not only for his survival, but to uncover the purpose of this mysterious war and his role in it. Hakuno faces his greatest challenge yet, armed with determination to solve the mystery of his lost identity and bring order to this virtual world gone mad.",
