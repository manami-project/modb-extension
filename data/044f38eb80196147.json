    "text": "Kirby, a small pink alien warrior, crash lands his spaceship on the planet Popstar, specifically in the region of Dream Land. There, he discovers the self-proclaimed ruler, King Dedede, oppressing the locals known as Cappies. King Dedede frequently orders dangerous monsters from Nightmare Enterprises, an evil company run by the sinister Emperor of Darkness named Nightmare. Kirby takes it upon himself to protect the Cappies by battling the variety of menacing beasts sent by King Dedede. Despite the constant threats, Kirby finds camaraderie among the grateful Cappies in Cappy Town. However, with his spaceship destroyed by King Dedede, it seems Kirby may be stranded on Popstar for a while as he continues his mission to aid the Cappies and take down Nightmare Enterprises.",
