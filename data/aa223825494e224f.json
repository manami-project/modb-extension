    "text": "Gord's Lounge was filled with the electric energy of a live performance by the rock band 'The White Nuts'. Unbeknownst to the band members, the peaceful aftermath of the Nozsa wars was about to be shattered. Apple, one of the band's charismatic members and a former hero of the White Knights, is kidnapped by a trio of thugs. The sadistic ODAMA clan, a family of ruthless killers, has their sights set on her.\n\nDetermined to rescue their friend, J.J., Champ, and the rest of the White Nuts set out on a daring mission. The heavily-fortified mountain retreat of the ODAMA clan is their destination, and their trusty laser weapon Zillion is their only aid. However, the former heroes are faced with a daunting challenge - their supply of Zillium, the ammunition for their Zillion guns, is critically low.\n\nAs they delve deeper into their rescue mission, they encounter a mysterious stranger named Rick. In a shocking revelation, Rick is revealed to be an old lover of Apple. The stakes are higher than ever, and the White Nuts must rely on their courage and resourcefulness to save their friend and bandmate from the clutches of the ODAMA clan.",
