    "text": "Guild receptionist Luna approaches Kazuma Satou with a quest to defeat a giant golem guarding ancient ruins. In an attempt to impress Ran, a novice adventurer and self-proclaimed fan of Kazuma, he accepts the quest and convinces his party to join him. Upon their successful return, Kazuma continues to boast to Ran, leading the receptionist to offer him another quest in the same ruins. Hoping to find valuable treasures, Kazuma and his party return to the ruins, but this time, they may have underestimated the challenge that awaits them. This unaired episode follows Kazuma's adventures after returning from Arcanretia and defeating one of the Devil King's generals, Hans, and living a life of luxury thanks to the reward money he earned.",
