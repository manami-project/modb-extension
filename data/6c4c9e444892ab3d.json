Reincarnated as the ruthless villainess Princess Pride Royal Ivy, she's destined to become the wicked queen and final boss. But our eight-year-old protagonist isn't one to follow the script. With vivid memories of her past life in Japan, she's determined to break free from her predetermined role. Armed with formidable powers and royal influence, she sets out to protect her kingdom and its people, even the male love interests she once tormented. As she navigates through her new life, she strives to rewrite her fate and become a beacon of hope instead of a harbinger of despair. Will she succeed in transforming her kingdom and earning the love of her subjects, or will her past catch up with her? Join Princess Pride on her journey to defy destiny and create a brighter future.",
