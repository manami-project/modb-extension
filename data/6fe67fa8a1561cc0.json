    "text": "Prismâ˜†Tours is the central theme of the animated film, PriPara the Movie: Everyone, Assemble!, which hit Japanese theaters on March 7, 2015. The movie revolves around the beloved character, Laala Manaka, as she uncovers the inspiring journey of Saints' top idol. Fans of the Pretty Rhythm series will be delighted to see the return of numerous characters from across all the series, making this film a must-watch for avid followers.\n\nAs the story unfolds, viewers will be presented with a unique cinematic experience: the characters face a choice of four doors, and the audience's selection dictates the route the film takes. Each door offers a different perspective on the previous Pretty Rhythm series, highlighting various characters and their performances. To fully appreciate every aspect of the film, viewers must watch it four times, as Laala and her friends can only enter one door at a time. This innovative approach to storytelling ensures an engaging and immersive experience for fans of the anime.",
