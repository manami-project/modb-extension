    "text": "What starts as an ordinary life for Galan, a university student and self-proclaimed samurai enthusiast, takes an extraordinary turn when he receives an ancient Japanese sword from Natsu, a fellow student. Invited to her hometown, a traditional Japanese village nestled in Russia, Galan embarks on an adventure filled with humor, ecchi situations, and unexpected challenges. Unbeknownst to him, Natsu is a princess in her village, and the sword he received is a betrothal heirloom. As Natsu tries to escape an arranged marriage set by her overly perverted father, Galan finds himself in the middle of a centuries-old secret surrounding the village and its people. To protect Natsu's family and the village, Galan must rise above his incompetence and transform into the samurai he's always dreamed of becoming. With the help of a cowgirl Interpol agent, Galan battles two attractive thieves who threaten to expose the village's secret. Can Galan uncover the truth behind the mysterious sword and become the hero he's always imagined himself to be?",
