    "text": "Earth and the mystical Land of Fountains are on the brink of destruction, and two unlikely heroes, Saki and Mai, are the only hope for salvation. Five years ago, the girls encountered two radiant orbs under the Sky Tree, an event that slipped from their memories until now. The orbs belong to Flappy and Choppy, spirits from the Land of Fountains, who bestowed upon the girls the powers of Pretty Cure. As the malevolent force of Dark Fall threatens both realms, Saki and Mai must harness their newfound abilities to protect the Seven Fountains and vanquish the looming darkness. Can these softball-loving artists transform into the warriors they were destined to become and save their worlds from impending doom? Join Saki and Mai on their journey as they become the NEW Pretty Cure.",
