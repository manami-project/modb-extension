  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aoi, Manami, Kio, and their Catian companions, led by the curious Eris, embark on a summer-long quest to understand the world of human games. As they navigate through classics like Monopoly and Twister, Eris introduces a Catian twist: each game comes with a wager. Initially, these bets involve cherished possessions, but as the stakes escalate, they find themselves risking personal items, even articles of clothing!\n\nAs the competition heats up, Aoi and Manami find themselves fixated on a particular item Kio has put up for grabs. However, their priorities shift drastically when an embarrassing DVD featuring both of them becomes part of the wager.\n\nMeanwhile, the Kemonomimi crew, including Kuune, Melwin, Chaika, and Dr. Durel, seem to have a unique interpretation of human games, leading to unconventional matches of Strip-Mahjong and Strip-Poker.\n\nJoin this lively group as they redefine game night, turning it into a thrilling, high-stakes affair filled with laughter, camaraderie, and a touch of mischief. Will they manage to keep their prized possessions—and their clothes—intact? Only one way to find out!",
