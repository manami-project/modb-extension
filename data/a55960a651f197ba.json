    "text": "Servants and Masters continue to clash in the Fifth Holy Grail War, but an ominous shadow looms over Fuyuki City, threatening to consume them all. Shirou Emiya, determined to protect Sakura Matou and uphold his ideals of justice, finds himself entangled in a web of darkness and deceit as Zouken Matou's involvement in the war twists reality. Summoning the enigmatic True Assassin, Zouken's actions exacerbate the situation, pushing the city further into chaos.\n\nAs Shirou resolves to stand his ground and safeguard Sakura, her concerns for him grow, and she becomes increasingly ensnared in her own destiny as a mage. The Matou siblings' dark secrets begin to unravel, adding layers of complexity to the already treacherous battlefield.\n\nWhile the remaining Masters and Servants fight for the Holy Grail, the mysterious black shadow casts a deadly pall over the city, indiscriminately claiming the lives of both combatants and innocents alike. As the second installment in the Fate/stay night: Heaven's Feel trilogy, Lost Butterfly plunges viewers deeper into a world where desires and ideals collide, and the line between hero and villain blurs. The relentless tide of darkness threatens to engulf everything, leaving the fate of Fuyuki City hanging in the balance.",
