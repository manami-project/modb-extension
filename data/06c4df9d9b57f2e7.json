  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime \"Obey Me!\" centers around seven demon brothers - Lucifer, Mammon, Leviathan, Satan, Asmodeus, Beelzebub, and Belphegor - who are princes of Hell and students at the Royal Academy of Diavolo (RAD). Though powerful and feared demons, their daily school lives are filled with lighthearted antics and misadventures stemming from their extreme personalities as avatars of the seven deadly sins. We see glimpses of the brothers using strange filters on their phones, playing video games, dressing up in silly costumes, and getting into trouble. Behind the scenes, they are more lovable and laughable than their fearsome reputations suggest. The anime depicts these lively shenanigans through slice-of-life vignettes separate from the game's main story. Ultimately, \"Obey Me!\" gives viewers a fun and amusing look at the whimsical side of these infamous demon brothers as they train at RAD to someday rule the Demon World. Their quirky escapades land them in funny situations daily, making us wonder - will they end up expelled or will one come out on top?",
