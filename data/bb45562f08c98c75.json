    "text": "The story of \"Wakakozake\" revolves around Murasaki Wakako, a 26-year-old office worker who finds solace in the delightful world of food and drink. After a long day at work, especially when the day has been particularly challenging, Wakako embarks on solo culinary adventures, exploring new pubs and eateries. She is not one to count calories or limit her alcohol intake, instead, she indulges in the joy of pairing her favorite dishes with the perfect drink. Each episode chronicles one of Wakako's gastronomic escapades, where the sight of a new menu brings a sparkle to her eyes and the perfect food-drink pairing elicits a contented 'Pshuuu' from her lips. Despite occasional worries about her weight, Wakako remains unwavering in her pursuit of culinary bliss. So, where will tonight's gastronomic journey take her?",
