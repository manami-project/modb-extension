  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the school year commences, Kaede Komura, a reserved middle school student, finds himself captivated by his new seatmate, Ai Mie. Her striking eyes, concealed behind thick glasses, and her forthright demeanor leave Kaede smitten. However, he soon discovers that Ai possesses an absent-minded side, frequently forgetting her glasses at home, rendering her nearly blind. Kaede, eager to assist, offers his help, and through their daily interactions, the two begin to form a bond, with Kaede hoping that one day, Ai will look his way with the same affection. Unbeknownst to Kaede, the reasons behind Ai's constant forgetfulness may not be as straightforward as they initially seemed.",
