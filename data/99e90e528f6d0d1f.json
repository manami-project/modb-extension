  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cobra Gang's reign of terror continues in a world where martial arts reign supreme, encompassing a diverse array of disciplines such as Chinese Kung Fu, Japanese Karate, and South Korean Taekwondo. Amidst this backdrop, one fighter stands above the rest â€“ Victory Ramenman, a formidable force who has honed his skills under the tutelage of the venerable Chen Sou-Mei.\n\nRamenman's journey begins with a tragic event: the brutal murder of his father, Somenman, at the hands of the ruthless Cobra Gang. Driven by an insatiable desire for vengeance, Ramenman embarks on a 12-year quest to master the Essential Battle Dragon style of Choujin Martial Arts under his wise master's guidance.\n\nNow, accompanied by his young sidekick Shao-Mai, Ramenman traverses the land, seeking retribution for his father's death. Along the way, he encounters numerous adversaries and forms alliances with fellow martial artists, bolstering his strength and resolve. As Ramenman's legend grows, so too does the anticipation for an epic showdown between the strongest fighter in the land and the nefarious Cobra Gang.",
