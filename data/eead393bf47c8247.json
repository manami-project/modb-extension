    "text": "With over two million copies in print, the highly acclaimed BL comic, 'Dakaretai Otoko No.1 ni Odosareteimasu' by Hashigo Sakurabi, receives a much-anticipated TV anime adaptation. The story revolves around Takato Saijyo, a seasoned actor who has held the coveted title of 'Most Desirable Bachelor' for five consecutive years, and Junta Azumaya, an up-and-coming actor who recently dethroned him. In the ruthless world of the entertainment industry, the two most desirable bachelors find themselves entangled in a forbidden scandal.\n\nTakato's five-year reign as the 'Most Huggable No. 1' has been usurped by Azumaya, a newbie actor with only three years of experience. Azumaya's sincere and radiant smile starts to affect the usually aloof and hostile Takato. Despite being on high alert, Takato is caught off guard in a compromising, drunken state by Azumaya, who seizes the opportunity to blackmail him. In exchange for his silence, Azumaya demands an unusual price: he wants Takato, the former 'Most Huggable No.1,' to embrace him.\n\nBased on the synopses provided, the anime promises a thrilling narrative filled with suspense, drama, and a dash of romance. The dynamic between the two main characters, coupled with the cutthroat nature of the entertainment industry, sets the stage for a captivating viewing experience.",
