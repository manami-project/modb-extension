  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Knight Parn, a legend of the \"War of Heroes\" that ended five years ago with the fall of Marmo's ruler, has become an inspiration to aspiring young squires like Spark, who dreams of becoming a hero. Serving at King Kashue's court, Spark encounters a group of dark elves attempting to steal treasure from Flaim Castle. Despite his valiant effort to stop them, he fails, but his bravery earns him a second chance from the king. He is sent on a mission with a group of adventurers to retrieve the stolen treasure, while the raiders plot to resurrect the goddess of death. Meanwhile, Ashram, King Kashue's trusted advisor, harbors ambitions of seizing power and uniting Lodoss under one banner.\n\nFive years ago, a band of six heroes saved the cursed island of Lodoss from the conquering armies of Marmo, the dark island. Now, the Black Knight of Marmo has returned to threaten the island once more. As the old heroes prepare to defend their homeland, a new generation of heroes must rise to face the looming conflict. Among them is Spark, an inexperienced young knight who finds himself at the center of the battle for Lodoss's fate. With aging legends like Ashram, Kashew, Parn, and Deedlit beginning to fade, it is up to Spark and his fellow adventurers to prevent Lodoss from being torn apart by war.",
