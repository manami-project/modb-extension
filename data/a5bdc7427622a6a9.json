  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiyorimi Hiro's life takes a dramatic turn when he sacrifices himself to save a mysterious, Gothic-clad woman from being crushed under construction beams. Little did he know, his selfless act would lead him to an afterlife far from what he'd imagined. Resurrected by the woman he saved, Hime, the princess of the Monster Realm, Hiro is now an undead warrior bound to protect her. Hime, not yet immortal, needs Hiro's help to fend off her power-hungry siblings, each vying for the throne by sending hordes of supernatural creatures to eliminate her. From vampires and zombies to the bizarre likes of were-sharks and killer dumplings, Hiro must face them all. As he navigates this eerie new existence, Hiro finds himself living in a creepy old mansion with his sister, who works as a maid, and serving a princess who's as close to 'good' as one can be on the wrong side of hell's gates. This is certainly not the reunion with his sister he'd envisioned, but it's the reality he must now embrace.",
