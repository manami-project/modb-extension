  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Saint Philia's blessings are invoked as the small kingdom of Inako, nestled between the military might of Milidonia and the devout theocracy of Selenfalen, sends its sole princess, Ani, to a peace treaty signing. The ceremony, held in Selenfalen, is intended to quell the rising tensions among the three nations. As the embodiment of resilience, pragmatism, and strong will, Princess Ani is well-equipped to navigate the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nUpon her arrival, she encounters an unexpected cast of characters - the enigmatic princes of her rival nations. First, she meets the ethereal Prince Ruze of Selenfalen, whose serene demeanor and striking beauty nearly lead Ani to mistake him for a girl. Their conversation, however, quickly descends into chaos. Just as Ani begins to grapple with the situation, an explosion rocks the ceremony, and in storm a group of even more peculiar princes.\n\nWith the treaty now binding the three nations together, Ani and the eccentric princes must set aside their differences and forge a path towards friendship. As they embark on this journey, they'll discover that finding common ground may be the key to lasting peace and unity.",
