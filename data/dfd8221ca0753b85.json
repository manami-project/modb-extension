    "text": "Pili International Media, known for their exceptional glove puppetry, teams up with the creative genius of Gen Urobuchi from Nitroplus to present a captivating wuxia fantasy series, Thunderbolt Fantasy. In a world reminiscent of ancient Eastern lore, a powerful magical sword, the Sword of Divine Retribution, becomes the focal point of a ruthless pursuit.\n\nAfter a devastating war between humans and the Demon Realm, several sacred weapons were crafted to defeat the demonic forces. Among these, the Sword of Divine Retribution was entrusted to the care of Dān Héng and Dān Fěi, siblings from a respected family of guardians. However, the sword's immense power attracts the unwanted attention of Miè Tiān Hái, a relentless warlord determined to seize it for his own nefarious purposes.\n\nWhen Miè Tiān Hái and his minions, the Xuan Gui Zong, launch an attack on the siblings, Dān Héng is defeated, leaving Dān Fěi with no choice but to flee. In her desperate escape, she encounters a wandering swordsman, Lǐn Xuě Yā, who becomes entangled in her plight after taking an umbrella from a ruined temple. Bound by a promise and unable to ignore the sorcery of their pursuers, Lǐn Xuě Yā joins Dān Fěi on a perilous journey to protect the sword and evade the clutches of Miè Tiān Hái. Thunderbolt Fantasy unfolds as an epic tale of adventure, magic, and the unyielding pursuit of power.",
