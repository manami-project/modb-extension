  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A mysterious island appears, becoming polluted by conflict between nations seeking to claim it. Biologist Dr. Yamadano studies the environmental changes and discovers a new humanoid species - the Fumoon - seemingly born from the island's wasteland. Hoping to share this discovery at an upcoming conference, Dr. Yamadano enlists detective Higeoyaji's help transporting a Fumoon specimen. However, the creature escapes using telekinetic powers, leaving a glittering trace matching ones found at animal disappearances. Higeoyaji pursues the Fumoon but both vanish, apparently kidnapped by an alien spaceship. His apprentice Kenichi and sister Peach join Dr. Yamadano at the conference to investigate. It seems Higeoyaji is held captive on the island, but how are the Fumoon involved? As environmental catastrophes unfold, the Fumoon's agenda and mankind's fate remain uncertain. Kenichi races to solve the deepening mystery, hoping to save his mentor and reveal the truth before it's too late.",
