    "text": "Nobita stumbles upon a mysterious object that resembles a rock, but he believes it to be a dinosaur egg. With the help of Doraemon's futuristic tools, they manage to hatch the egg, revealing a baby Plesiosaur. Nobita affectionately names the creature Piisuke and decides to raise it. However, as Piisuke grows, it becomes increasingly difficult to keep him hidden from the world. In an attempt to protect Piisuke, Nobita and Doraemon send him back to the Cretaceous era. Unfortunately, the time machine malfunctions, leaving Piisuke stranded in prehistoric America instead of Japan. To make matters worse, a group of ruthless hunters from the future threatens the safety of the dinosaurs. Determined to save Piisuke and the other dinosaurs, Doraemon and the gang embark on a thrilling prehistoric adventure filled with danger, excitement, and the strong bond of friendship. With the time machine broken and the hunters hot on their trail, will they be able to find a way home and rescue Piisuke in time? Join Nobita, Doraemon, and the rest of the gang in this action-packed journey through time!",
