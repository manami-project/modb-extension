    "text": "Inspired by Arthur C. Clarke's 'Deep Range', the short experimental anime series 'Dolphin Prince' graced the black and white screens of Fuji TV for a brief three-episode run. Airing on Sundays at 7.30pm, the series introduced viewers to the young Dolphin Prince, a boy of the sea accompanied by his loyal pet dolphin and equipped with a wetsuit jetpack and an aqua-boomerang. Alongside his mermaid companion Neptuna and Dr. Mariner, the trio embarked on thrilling underwater adventures in episodes titled 'Secret Of The Red Vortex', 'Call Of The Sea', and 'Attack Of The Sea-Star People'. Despite its limited run, the series left a lasting impression with its unique narrative and captivating characters.",
