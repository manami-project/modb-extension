    "text": "There was a time of turmoil during the third year of Emperor Shizong's rule, where the world was plunged into chaos and people struggled to survive. The central government had crumbled, leading to the division of territories and the rise of powerful independent factions. Evil sects lurked in the shadows, causing mayhem, while rival gangs fought for dominance. Natural disasters wreaked havoc on the people, leaving them desperate for hope and salvation.\n\nIn this chaos, various sects and schools emerged, vying for resources and land to establish their own rules. Power-hungry individuals sought to control the world and establish their own dynasty, while others fought to save the common people. Amidst this struggle for power, Wei He emerged with a legendary pearl that could break through realms, allowing him to navigate the chaos and forge his own path to greatness. With the pearl's power, Wei He set out to create his own legend, one step at a time.",
