    "text": "Before dragons appeared and altered the world 25 years ago, no one could have predicted the birth of superhuman girls called \"D girls,\" who possess the dragons' powers. Now, the only male D, Yuu Mononobe, finds himself enrolled at Midgar, an academy exclusively for D girls. Upon his arrival, he encounters Iris, a rebellious D girl, in an unexpected and embarrassing situation. To his surprise, he also reunites with his long-lost sister, Mitsuki, who was separated from him at birth. As the only male D, Yuu must form alliances with the girls around him and harness his powers to confront the seven dragons that threaten to destroy the world. Join Yuu, Iris, and their friends as they navigate the challenges of Midgar Academy and embark on a thrilling journey to save the world from the menace of the dragons.",
