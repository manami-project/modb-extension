  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a far-off corner of the cosmos, two formidable civilizations, the Paranoids, a race of extraterrestrial humanoids, and the Solenoids, an exclusively female society, have been locked in a relentless conflict for centuries. Amidst a fierce battle, the Solenoid fleet receives a distress call to safeguard a newly terraformed world from the Paranoids. During the retreat, one Solenoid vessel, the Star Leaf, is detached from the fleet, leaving only seven survivors aboard: Eluza, the captain; Rabby, the de facto leader; Lufy, the audacious pilot; Catty, the enigmatic science officer; Pony, the pink-haired, scatterbrained technician; Patty, the dependable crewmate; and Remy, the endearing one. With the battle barely evaded, the Star Leaf's crew resolves to fulfill their mission and meet at Planet Chaos to defend it. However, unbeknownst to them, their ship is the focus of a Paranoid experiment. Ultimately, the fate of the idyllic Planet Chaos rests in the hands of the Star Leaf's remaining crew, who must fend off the Paranoid armada and the machinations of their own Solenoid commanders.",
