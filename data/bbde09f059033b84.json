    "text": "Hibiki Sakura is a high school girl with an enormous appetite and love for food. However, her overindulgent eating habits start to negatively impact her waistline and raise concerns from her friends about her weight gain. Wanting to better herself, Hibiki decides to join a gym and get in shape. She scopes out the nearby Silverman Gym, but is immediately intimidated by the hulking, muscular bodybuilders that seem to dominate the space. Additionally complicating matters, Hibiki runs into Akemi Souryuuin, the student council president from her school who turns out to have an aggressive muscle fetish. Just as Hibiki is about to flee the uncomfortable environment, she locks eyes with the gym's handsome personal trainer, Machio. Entranced by her dreamy prince, Hibiki impulsively signs up for a membership. Now a member of Silverman Gym, Hibiki must adapt to the intense yet enjoyable world of fitness training. Guided by her affection for Machio and newfound gym friends, she tackles her insecurities and embarks on a transformative journey to achieve her ideal body.",
