  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Myne—now a blue-robed apprentice priestess—faces a challenging winter as she prepares for the Dedication Ceremony at the church. Her exceptional knowledge and mana have caught the attention of dangerous individuals, forcing the High Priest to assign her a bodyguard and advise her to be adopted by a noble family for her safety. This decision would mean leaving her family behind, a prospect Myne strongly opposes. Faced with an ultimatum, Myne must choose between her family and her own safety while continuing her quest to create a letterpress and make books more accessible to the public. As the winter turns to spring, Myne's future remains uncertain, but she remains determined to protect her loved ones and pursue her dreams. Based on Part 2 of Honzuki no Gekokujou, this anime adaptation follows Myne's journey as she navigates the dangers of her new life and strives to bring about change in the world of books.",
