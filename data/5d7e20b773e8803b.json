  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zasshono Academy is a massive school with over 50,000 students across all grades. Among the numerous student clubs is the mysterious Eiken Club, whose members are mostly charismatic and busty girls. Densuke Mifune, a new and unremarkable high school student, has a fateful encounter with Chiharu Shinonome, the school's brilliant and beautiful top scorer. After accidentally falling into her chest, Densuke is forced by other Eiken Club members to join their group. As part of the club, Densuke finds himself caught up in sexy hijinks and compromising positions with the busty members. However, he only has eyes for the sweet yet distant Chiharu. Though his attempts to get closer to her often backfire, making him look like a pervert, Densuke persists in trying to win her affection. He races against time to make headway with Chiharu before other romantic rivals have the chance.",
