    "text": "Yomiko Readman is a cheerful bookworm who works as a substitute teacher. But in secret, she is Agent Paper - a superspy for the British Library with the power to telekinetically control paper. Along with her stylish partner Ms. Deep, Yomiko travels the world retrieving rare books and manuscripts. Their latest mission leads them to some lost Beethoven music that has fallen into the wrong hands. A shadowy group of villains known as the I-Jin Army plans to use the music to activate Beethoven's long lost Death Symphony. Anyone who hears the Death Symphony is compelled to commit suicide, allowing the I-Jin Army to essentially mind-control the population. With her unwavering love of books and some crafty paper skills, Yomiko races against time to track down the music. She must stop the I-Jin Army from broadcasting the lethal Death Symphony while also uncovering the truth behind the I-Jin Army's sinister plans. It's a battle to save both her beloved books and the entire world.",
