    "text": "Ultra Maniac follows Ayu Tateishi, a popular eighth grade girl who is a member of her school's tennis club. Though seemingly cool and collected, Ayu secretly acts this way in hopes of catching the eye of her crush Tetsushi Kaji from the baseball team. Ayu's life takes an unexpected turn with the arrival of Nina Sakura, a transfer student who happens to be a witch from the Magic Kingdom. Though Nina has come to the human world to continue her magical training, her skills leave much to be desired. Before long, Ayu gets swept up in Nina's magical escapades. Between Nina's well-meaning but hapless spellcasting causing chaos and Ayu trying to keep her real personality hidden to maintain her image, the two find their everyday middle school lives filled with adventure. Yet there seems to be more to Nina's story as questions arise around why she is really there and the sudden appearance of her childhood friend Maya who is a black magic user. With comedy and romance abounding, Ayu strives to get closer to her baseball star crush while helping Nina develop her magic skills and adjust to human world life. But they soon discover that magic always comes with complications, especially when the heart is involved.",
