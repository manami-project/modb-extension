    "text": "B't X and Teppei embark on a daring mission to save Teppei's brother, Kotaro Takamiya, from the clutches of the formidable Machine Empire. The OAV series follows the TV series, with Hokuto enhancing B't X's power and joining Teppei's quest. As Teppei's relentless pursuit of his brother escalates into a full-blown war, the Empire's Spiritual Guardians rally behind him to uncover the true intentions of the Machine Empire and halt their destructive rampage.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, four knights from the Machine Empire defect and join Teppei's cause. However, their ultimate goal is not just to free Teppei's brother, but to destroy B't Raphael â€“ the most powerful B't ever created. If Raphael's power continues to grow unchecked, it could spell doom for both the Machine Empire and the entire planet. With Teppei seemingly being the only one capable of defeating Raphael, he must navigate through the remaining Machine Empire forces, vanquish Raphael, and save his brother. Will Teppei succeed in his high-stakes mission?",
