    "text": "Qiao Jingting finds himself trapped in a brutal game world after a traffic accident, where people's memories are frozen at the moment of their near-death experience. To survive, players must strengthen themselves through a points system, leading many to resort to unscrupulous means. Qiao forms an alliance with the vengeful Shu Ai and enigmatic Bai Er against the villainous Han Bin, who tyrannizes over novice players. After initial defeats, they gain a powerful but roguish ally in Zou Yidao, whose questionable motives place him at odds with Han Bin. Ultimately, Qiao's party defeats Han Bin, only to face even greater threats beyond the novice village. As Qiao and his companions progress in this merciless world, they must contend with ever more formidable enemies and crises that test the limits of their strength and morality. Yet their shared tribulations also forge profound bonds of loyalty and trust. By banding together, they retain hope of uncovering the dark secrets behind the Abyss Game and perhaps even attaining freedom.",
