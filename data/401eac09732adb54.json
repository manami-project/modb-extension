    "text": "At a young age, Sakura Mamiya vanished in the woods near her grandmother's house, only to reappear unscathed. However, the incident left her with an uncanny ability to perceive the supernatural. As she navigates through high school, she yearns for a normal life, devoid of spectral disturbances. But normalcy seems elusive when her perpetually absent classmate, Rinne Rokud≈ç, finally shows up one day, revealing himself to be far from ordinary.\n\nRinne, dressed in peculiar attire, shares Sakura's supernatural sight, but there's more to him than meets the eye. He is a shinigami, tasked with guiding wandering spirits to the wheel of reincarnation. Despite his impressive lineage and skills, Rinne grapples with financial difficulties, often relying on Sakura's assistance to resolve his cases.\n\nAs Sakura delves deeper into Rinne's world, she discovers a hidden realm coexisting with ours, teeming with eccentric characters and spirits. Kyoukai no Rinne invites you to join Sakura on her extraordinary journey, exploring the unseen world and unraveling the mysteries surrounding Rinne's true identity.",
