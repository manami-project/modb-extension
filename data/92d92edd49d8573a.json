    "text": "These colossal life-forms known as 'Fiaremu' have emerged, posing a significant threat to humanity in the year 2:35 E.R. Traditional combat androids, the 'Ektis', prove insufficient against these towering behemoths. In a bid to counteract this overwhelming force, a congress of nations approves the use of Cell Growth Factor CGF-3, enabling the enlargement of human soldiers for military purposes. Enter the 'Ragna Strikers', a specialized unit comprised of six young women chosen for their compatibility with the CGF-3. Follow Ayano Anemori and her companions as they navigate daily life while defending Earth from the menacing Fiaremu, growing to astonishing heights and wielding advanced weaponry. Will they be able to turn the tide of the war and save humanity? Join the Ragna Strikers in their epic battle against the Fiaremu and discover the answer.",
