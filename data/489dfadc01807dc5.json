    "text": "Academy student Illyasviel von Einzbern finds her ordinary life turned upside down when a magical wand, Magical Ruby, coerces her into a contract, transforming her into a magical girl. As Illya embarks on a mission to collect the seven elusive Class Cards, she encounters unexpected allies, like Miyu Edelfelt, and even her own magical doppelganger! Just when she thinks she deserves a break, her beach vacation morphs into a magical escapade, leading to a series of enchanted disputes, love potions, and a foray into the realm of 'boys love' comics. But the real challenge lies ahead: retrieving the elusive Eighth Card! Based on Hiroshi Hiroyama's manga, Fate/Kaleid Liner Prismaâ˜†Illya 2wei!, itself a spin-off of Type-Moon's Fate/stay night erotic visual novel, this anime promises a whirlwind of magical adventures and unexpected twists.",
