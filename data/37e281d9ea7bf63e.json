  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set during Japan's Warring States period, this anime follows the unlikely friendship between Tono, a once-fearsome warrior now living in poverty, and a short-limbed dog he takes in. Though initially overwhelmed by the dog's energetic and mischievous nature, Tono finds amusement and joy in their cohabitation. Despite their vastly different pasts, the two form a harmonious bond, finding happiness and peace in each other's company as they face their modest present circumstances together.",
