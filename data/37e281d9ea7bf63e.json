  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japan's Warring States era, a time when 'demi-gods' once roamed and shaped the fate of the land, now serves as the backdrop for an unlikely tale. At the heart of this narrative is Tono, a man who once commanded fear as a god-like warrior but has since descended into poverty, residing in a humble tenement house.\n\nOne day, Tono crosses paths with a peculiar dog, its limbs unusually short. Compassion stirs within him, and he extends a helping hand to the creature. However, the dog proves to be far from the submissive companion Tono might have anticipated. The dog's mischievous and unrestrained nature soon becomes apparent, turning Tono's already precarious life into a whirlwind of unexpected chaos.\n\nDespite the dog's unruly behavior, Tono finds himself drawn into a unique bond with his newfound companion. The once-feared warrior and the free-spirited dog embark on a shared journey, navigating the ups and downs of their unconventional cohabitation. Their life together unfolds as a testament to friendship's transformative power, infusing their humble existence with a newfound sense of peace and harmony.",
