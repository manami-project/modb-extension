    "text": "Series Spinoff novel. The narrative unfolds on Valentine's Day, a time of year often fraught with tension. For a group of heroines from the second season, this day presents a unique challenge as they navigate the complexities of expressing their feelings to the main character, Sugisaki Ken, resulting in a situation that's doubly uncomfortable. This OVA is a special addition to the eighth volume of Aoi Sekina's Hekiyou Gakuen Seitokai Mokushiroku spinoff novel, which is itself a part of the wider Seitokai no Ichizon light novel series.",
