When her friend, Risa Shiramine, invites her to join the popular VRMMO game, \"New World Online,\" Kaede takes a unique approach to character creation. Determined to avoid any pain, she pours all her stat points into defense, creating a character named Maple.

With \"Absolute Defense\" and a powerful counterattack, Maple becomes an unstoppable force, capable of taking down enemies with a single hit. As she navigates the thrilling world of \"New World Online,\" Maple's extraordinary abilities and resilience earn her a reputation as a formidable player. But even with her impressive skills, Maple has much to learn about the game and the friends she'll meet along the way.",
