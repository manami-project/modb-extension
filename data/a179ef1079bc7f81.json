  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Whale Island native Gon Freecss, inspired by his father's legendary status as a top-tier Hunter, embarks on a daring journey to follow in his footsteps. With dreams of locating his long-lost parent and becoming a Hunter himself, Gon must first conquer the notoriously challenging Hunter Exam, a test that only one in hundreds of thousands can pass.\n\nOn the eve of his departure, Gon secures his aunt Mito's approval to take the exam by catching the elusive Master of the Swamp. Bidding farewell to his loved ones, Gon sets sail for the mainland, where he encounters fellow Hunter hopefuls Leorio and Kurapika. The three find themselves working together to protect the ship from monstrous sea creatures in what turns out to be the first of many trials on their path to becoming Hunters.\n\nAlong his journey, Gon befriends Killua, a boy hailing from a well-known assassin family, and Kurapica, who seeks vengeance against the criminals responsible for his tribe's demise. Together, they strive to overcome the formidable challenges that lie ahead, driven by their individual goals and the allure of the Hunter lifestyle â€“ a world filled with fame, fortune, and undiscovered lands.",
