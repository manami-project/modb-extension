  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seth is an aspiring young sorcerer living in a pastoral village who dreams of gaining enough power to defeat the Némeses, mysterious and dangerous monsters that periodically fall from the sky. After his village is attacked by the Némeses, Seth realizes he must embark on a quest to find and destroy the Némeses' source, a mythical land called the Radiant. Seth joins a faction of fellow sorcerers who have survived encounters with the Némeses and gained special powers as a result of the contact. Together, they travel in search of the Radiant while confronting prejudice from normal humans who fear and persecute them for being \"infected.\" Seth and his companions hope to not only reach the Radiant and vanquish it along with the Némeses, but also bring about a world where sorcerers are no longer outcasts because of their powers. Throughout their journey they face numerous obstacles - dangerous monsters, the oppressive Inquisition that tracks their every move, challenging quests to unlock their abilities, and mysteries surrounding the true nature of the Némeses. But Seth and his loyal band of sorcerers press on with courage and camaraderie, determined to unleash their magic to defeat their foes and discover the secrets of the Radiant.",
