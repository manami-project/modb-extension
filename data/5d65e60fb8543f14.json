  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ousai Private Academy was originally an all-girls high school that got converted into a co-educational institution due to declining birth rates. The first-year male students find themselves vastly outnumbered by girls. One such student is Takatoshi Tsuda, who gets scolded on his very first day by the intimidating student council president Shino Amakusa. This encounter introduces Tsuda to the other student council members as well. As an apology for the rough start, Shino allows Tsuda to join the student council. Thus begins Tsuda's days as the only \"normal\" student in Ousai Academy. In the student council movie, Takatoshi, Shino, Aria, Suzu and other students go on amusing adventures like beach trips, neighborhood cleanups, TV interviews, and more. Their everyday interactions continue to be defined by double entendres, innuendos and euphemisms. The new teacher also stirs up further potential for awkward misunderstandings. Through it all, the student council members demonstrate that their entertaining exploits are never done.",
