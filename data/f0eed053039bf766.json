After a series of unfortunate events, including a rejected manuscript and a near-death experience, Ryo's life takes a dramatic turn when he witnesses a murder.

With their lives on the line, Ryo and Yuki must navigate through high-speed chases, perilous encounters, and the looming threat of death.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Ryo is forced to transform from a struggling writer to the action hero he's always penned, blurring the lines between his reality and the stories he creates. Will Ryo rise to the occasion and emerge as the hero, or will he become another casualty in this deadly game? Only time will tell in this thrilling anime adventure.",
