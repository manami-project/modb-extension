  "synopsis": {
    "text": "For centuries, there was an ongoing war between two opposing factions - the Sky People (Kuu no mono) and the Sorcerers (You no mono). Nine hundred years ago, the commanders of both sides sacrificed themselves to seal away the other, bringing an end to the long conflict. In present day, the Sorcerers have begun to reawaken, signaling the potential for renewed clashes. \n\nAs the reincarnation of the Sky People's past commander, Shinobu Saiga takes on a leadership role to once again subdue the rising Sorcerers. He is aided by Kiba and a group known as the Skilled Ones (Jutsusha), humans with inherited supernatural abilities.  \n\nMeanwhile, high school student Ryosuke Sakiya possesses extraordinarily strong psychic powers that let him see and hear things beyond normal perception. His unique aura catches the attention of the awakening Sorcerers, who target Ryosuke for unknown reasons. While on a date, Ryosuke gets attacked but is rescued by two Skilled Ones, Jukyuro Satomi and Kisara Izumi.\n\nDespite escaping unharmed, Ryosuke finds himself caught in the brewing conflict between the two factions. With both sides converging around him, will the reluctant teenager understand why he has been dragged into this ancient war?",
