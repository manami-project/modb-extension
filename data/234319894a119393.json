  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two thousand years ago, the land of Mistarcia was threatened by Bahamut, a destructive black-and-silver winged dragon. Humans, gods, and demons overcame their differences to fight together and seal Bahamut's power into a key that was split in two. One half was protected by the gods and the other by demons, bringing an era of peace. Now, that peace is shattered when a mysterious woman named Amira steals the god's half of the key. Amira was created to absorb both halves and release Bahamut. After losing a wing stealing the key, she ends up meeting Favaro, a laid-back bounty hunter. Though at first reluctant, Favaro promises to guide Amira to the demons' land in return for a kiss. As they travel together, they get caught up in an epic clash between gods and demons vying for the key that keeps Bahamut imprisoned. With the apocalypse nearing, this unlikely pair may be the only hope for the world of Mistarcia. Will they choose to forge their own path or will Bahamut finally bring destruction?",
