  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a fictional archipelago with anti-gravitational \"Grav-Shoes\" that allow people to fly, a popular aerial sport called \"Flying Circus\" has emerged. The story follows Asuka Kurashina, a clumsy yet passionate transfer student who joins the Flying Circus club at Kunahama High School. Asuka quickly develops an keen interest in Flying Circus. Along with her teammates - the experienced Misaki Tobisawa, the overprotective Mashiro Arisaka, and the knowledgeable Masaya Hinata who once pursued a career in the sport - Asuka practices intensely with the goal of competing in a summer tournament. Though they occasionally clash, Asuka's bond with her teammates deepens as they support each other's growth and take on talented rivals. Together, they hone their aerial techniques and strategy to reach new heights. Ao no Kanata no Four Rhythm is an inspirational story about this fledgling Flying Circus team persevering through adversity as they strive to follow their sky-bound dreams.",
