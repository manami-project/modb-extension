  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Centuries ago in feudal Japan, a ruthless Demon King and his demonic followers, the Kyouma, wreaked havoc across the land. Ten brave warriors banded together, combining their powers to defeat the Demon King and seal him and the Kyouma away for eternity. In present-day Tokyo, the seal has begun to weaken, allowing lesser Kyouma demons to slip through and terrorize the city. It turns out the ten ancient warriors have been reincarnated in modern times. At the center of this brewing supernatural crisis is Juuto, an unassuming teenager who is struggling to accept his destiny as the leader of the reincarnated warriors. With the unwitting help of his classmate Kyoshiro, Juuto must quickly master his emerging spiritual powers if he hopes to seal away the Demon King once more before the vile entity breaks free and unleashes Hell on Earth. Time is running out as the Kyouma become bolder and more dangerous with each passing day. Juuto and his allies face a race against time to defeat the rising dark forces and prevent the resurrection of the infamous Demon King.",
