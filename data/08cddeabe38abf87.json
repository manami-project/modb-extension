    "text": "King of Demons, a malevolent entity once sealed away by ten valiant warriors, is now on the brink of resurrection, threatening the tranquility of modern-day Tokyo. As his minions, the Kyouma, begin to wreak havoc, the responsibility falls upon the shoulders of the reincarnated warriors to once again unite and thwart the impending doom. Among them are the reluctant Juuto and the resolute Kyoshiro, who must rally their fellow warriors and embrace their shared destiny to vanquish the darkness that looms over the world. But as the sinister Lord Shindigan schemes to release the Demon King, the question remains: will the tenth warrior rise to the challenge and complete the formidable alliance? Only time will tell if these chosen ones can save the Earth from the clutches of evil.",
