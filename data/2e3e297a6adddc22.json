    "text": "Hana Uzaki, a vivacious and lively freshman, is determined to prevent her former high school senior, Shinichi Sakurai, from becoming a recluse in college. Despite his introverted nature and preference for solitude, Sakurai finds himself drawn into Uzaki's whirlwind of fun and laughter. As they spend more time together, their relationship evolves from bickering acquaintances to close friends, with others even mistaking them for a couple. Despite the chaos and hijinks that Uzaki brings into his life, Sakurai begins to appreciate her company and realizes that being with others can be just as enjoyable as being alone. As their bond deepens, the two embark on a heartwarming journey filled with humor and adorable moments.",
