Home to over two million inhabitants from both dimensions, this urban utopia is celebrated as the \"City of Dreams.\" However, beneath its glamorous facade, the city grapples with the dark underbelly of crime, drugs, and prostitution.\n\nEnter Kei Matoba, a skilled yet unconventional detective of the San Teresa Police Department, and Tilarna Exedilika, a naive but valiant knight from the enchanted world of Leto Semani. Despite their stark differences and initial clashes, the unlikely duo is forced to join forces to combat the escalating chaos that threatens the delicate balance between their parallel worlds.
