The second episode shifts focus to an unexpected invasion of colossal monsters, promising laughter amidst chaos.\n\nReturning to the uncouth family in the third episode, viewers will be entertained by the trials and tribulations of newlywed life. Lastly, the fourth episode introduces a determined boxer with an unusual weight-loss regimen: abstinence.\n\nPrepare for a unique and raunchy anime experience that combines humor, absurdity, and a touch of the extraordinary.",
