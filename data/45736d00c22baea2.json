  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Hand Island no Bouken special follows the Straw Hat Pirates, led by Monkey D. Luffy, as they land on Hand Island after narrowly escaping a battle with Marine Commodore Bilić and his warships. On the island, they discover a dire shortage of supplies due to exploitation by Bilić, who has taken many islanders hostage in his naval base to power a massive cannon aimed at the island. The pirates meet Diego, a gifted wax artisan whose son joined the Marines and has not returned. Luffy offers to help Diego confront Bilić and free the islanders. The special also features a retelling of Luffy's childhood meeting with Red-Haired Shanks, which led him to set sail and become a pirate. Through this thrilling island adventure and origin tale, Luffy demonstrates his unwavering commitment to helping innocents in need and taking a stand against tyranny - the very spirit that makes him a formidable pirate captain destined to become the King of the Pirates.",
