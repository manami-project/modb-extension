However, an unexpected event leaves Akiyo in distress, compelling Masaya to embark on a daring quest to the far-off Ipponsugi forest. His mission: to locate the cherished spotted bellflowers that hold a special place in Akiyo's heart. As Masaya ventures into the unknown, he learns that the world is filled with countless unexplored paths waiting to be discovered.
