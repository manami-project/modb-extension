    "text": "Masaya is a timid first-grade boy who relies on his friend Akiyo, a strong-willed second-grade girl, to walk with him to school each day along a dark forest path. Though much larger in size, Masaya looks up to tiny Akiyo for her boldness and wants to be as brave as she is. One day, something upsets Akiyo deeply, leaving her in tears. To cheer her up, Masaya decides to trek to the distant Ipponsugi forest in search of Akiyo's favorite spotted bellflowers. This journey into the unknown proves to be a challenging test of courage for young Masaya as he ventures forth alone for the first time. Along the way, he discovers that the world still holds many mysteries yet to be revealed to him.",
