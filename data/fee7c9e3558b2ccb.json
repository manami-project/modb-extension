    "text": "In post-WWII Japan, Professor Kaneda had started developing giant robots called Tetsujins as weapons for Japan during the war, after tragically losing his wife and son. His greatest creation was Tetsujin 28, named after his late son Shotaro. However, hoping to prevent further bloodshed, Kaneda hid Tetsujin 28 away before it could be used. Years later, Kaneda's protege Professor Shikishima has taken over the robotics program and built Shikishima Industries into a technological powerhouse. However, Shotaro is revealed to have survived and shows up hoping to uncover secrets about his father's death. Meanwhile, Tetsujin 28 is resurrected after 28 attempts by Shikishima. Shotaro decides to join forces with Tetsujin 28 once more. Together, they wage a courageous battle against evil and unravel the mysteries behind Shikishima Industries' technological success. Through this journey, Shotaro comes to learn surprising truths about his father's legacy.",
