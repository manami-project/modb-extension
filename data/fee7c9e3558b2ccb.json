The secret revolves around the development of giant robots as a potential war-winning weapon, and the successful creation of the 28th Tetsujin by Prof. Kaneda, who was driven by the loss of his wife and son, Shotaro.\n\nYears after the war, Shotaro Kaneda, now a detective, embarks on a quest to unravel the mysterious circumstances surrounding his father's death and the dark past of the Shikishima Group. As fate would have it, Shotaro crosses paths with a giant robot, Tetsujin, which holds the key to his father's legacy.\n\nThe resurrected Tetsujin, brought back to life after 28 attempts by Prof. Shikishima, becomes an unlikely ally for Shotaro. Together, they embark on a courageous journey to uncover hidden truths and protect their nation from the looming threats of the past.
