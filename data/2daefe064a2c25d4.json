  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a futuristic Japan where technology has blurred the line between human and machine, Section 9, an elite special ops force led by the mostly cybernetic Major Motoko Kusanagi, combats advanced cybercrime and terrorism. As refugees displaced by war seek asylum in Japan, the country faces a crisis. Meanwhile, Section 9 investigates a sinister group called the Individual Eleven behind a spate of suicide terrorist attacks. They uncover a connection between these events and Gouda Kazundo, a high-ranking government official who may be manipulating things secretly. Section 9 races to get to the bottom of Gouda's schemes as the refugee crisis threatens to plunge Japan into chaos. With their technologically-enhanced bodies and minds, Major Kusanagi, Batou, Togusa, and the team are uniquely equipped for the high stakes mission. But they soon find the case goes deeper than they imagined, ultimately forcing them to question the essence of human existence in a world increasingly dominated by technology.",
