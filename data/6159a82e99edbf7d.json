    "text": "Aki's life is threatened by this group, Hikaru must team up with Arma to find the courage to fight back and, along the way, learn that his life will never be ordinary again.\n\nIn a world where alien lifeforms have fused with humans to create mechanized limbs known as 'Mecha-ude,' an average middle schooler named Hikaru Amatsuga finds himself in an unlikely partnership with a rare and special Mecha-ude named Arma. As they navigate their new life full of trouble and danger, Hikaru and Arma meet other Mecha-ude users, including an active and outgoing girl with two Mecha-ude of her own. But when the mysterious Kagami Group begins searching for the mythical 'Trigger Arm,' said to grant unlimited power, Hikaru and his friends must band together to protect their Mecha-ude partners and uncover the secrets of their existence. Along the way, Hikaru discovers that his Mecha-ude is more than just a weapon, but a sentient being with its own feelings and opinions. With the help of his newfound friends and the resistance group ARMS, Hikaru must find the courage to fight back against those who threaten the safety of his Mecha-ude partner and the world as he knows it.",
