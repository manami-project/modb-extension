  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryo Asuka, driven by desperation and a cunning plan, orchestrates the possession of his virtuous friend, Akira Fudo, by a formidable demon named Amon. In a world where humans are no match for the overwhelming power of demons, the only way to combat such malevolent forces is with the strength of another demon. As Akira's heart is pure, he may be able to control Amon and become humanity's sole beacon of hope against the hidden demon threat that has tormented them since time immemorial.\n\nIn modern-day Tokyo, Akira's once ordinary high school life starts to unravel when his parents vanish, and his pet rabbit meets a grisly end. As if that wasn't enough, Ryo reveals a dark secret that will forever alter Akira's existence. His missing archaeologist father has left him a sinister inheritance, one that holds the key to safeguarding humanity from demonic enslavement. However, there's a catch â€“ anyone who slays a demon risks becoming one themselves. Only someone with a truly pure heart can harness a demon's power without succumbing to its influence. Is Akira's heart pure enough to control Amon and save mankind? The answer lies in the second part of the OVA.",
