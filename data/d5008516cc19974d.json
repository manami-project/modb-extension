  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Baki Hanma, a 17-year-old prodigy in the world of martial arts, becomes the center of attention as five of the world's deadliest convicts, driven by an insatiable desire to experience defeat, escape their respective prisons and descend upon Tokyo. The second installment of the Baki manga series, this anime brings forth an unorthodox tournament that transcends the confines of a traditional ring, with combatants hailing from the darkest corners of the globe.\n\nMitsunari Tokugawa, the orchestrator of this unprecedented event, gathers Baki and four other formidable opponents to face off against these ruthless death row inmates in a series of no-holds-barred battles. The rules are simple: there are none. The stage is set for a brutal and intense competition that can take place at any moment, in any location, without any limitations.\n\nAs the five convicts, each with their own sinister motives and unparalleled skills, converge at Tokugawa's coliseum, they find themselves locked in a fierce contest against Baki and his handpicked allies. In the heart of Tokyo, this unique and savage tournament unfolds, pushing each combatant to their limits as they seek to test their strength against the most worthy adversaries they have ever faced.",
