    "text": "Cybertron’s tranquility is shattered when Galvatron and his newly assembled Decepticon Headmasters launch a devastating assault on the planet. Just as the Cybertronians face imminent defeat, the Autobot Headmasters, commanded by Fortress (Cerebros, the head component of Fortress Maximus), make a timely intervention. After millions of years of scouring the cosmos for energy, Fortress has finally returned home. The Headmasters, originally small Cybertronians, found themselves stranded on the inhospitable planet Master. To endure the harsh conditions, they constructed larger bodies, known as 'Transtectors', and connected to them as heads. Now, they're back and ready to join the Autobot-Decepticon war. The Master Wars, fueled by the planet Master's advanced science, have begun.\n\nSix years have elapsed since the climactic battle against Unicron, and a rogue group of Headmasters, under Weirdwolf's leadership, have allied with Galvatron and the Decepticons to attack Cybertron. The Autobots, led by Fortress, rally to defend their home planet. Unfortunately, the situation deteriorates as Vector Sigma, the super-computer at Cybertron’s core, becomes unstable. Optimus Prime once again sacrifices himself to save the planet, but it's a temporary fix. A bomb attack, orchestrated by Scorponok, reduces Cybertron to a barren wasteland. Rhodimus Prime embarks on a mission to find a new home for the Transformers, leaving Fortress in charge and operating from the planet Athenia. Meanwhile, Scorponok assumes leadership of the Decepticons following Galvatron's disappearance in the explosion",
