    "text": "Zetton, Red King, and their monstrous comrades from the Ultra franchise find solace in an unusual watering hole â€“ the 'Monster Bar.' After a long day of battling Ultra heroes, these creatures gather to unwind, recharge, and strategize for their next evil endeavors. The bar is managed by Baltan, with Dada and Kanegon as his trusty assistants, and Pigmon as the part-time worker. Regular patrons include Eleking, Gomora, Gudon, King Joe, and Twin Tail. This anime, inspired by the real-life Kaijuu Sakaba tavern, showcases the challenges of running a bar for kaijuu while providing a unique twist on the classic Ultraman franchise. As these monsters swap stories and plan their next encounters with the Ultra heroes, viewers get a glimpse into a world where even villains need a break.",
