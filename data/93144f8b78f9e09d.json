  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kaijū Sakaba offers an amusing glimpse into the daily lives of famous tokusatsu monsters from the Ultra franchise. Weary from constantly battling the Ultra heroes, these monsters convene nightly at a bar aptly named \"Monster Bar\" to unwind over drinks with their fellow kaiju comrades. Managed by the mischievous alien Baltan and his assistants Dada and Kanegon, the Monster Bar welcomes both veteran and up-and-coming beasts. Red King, Eleking, Gomora, and other notorious regulars swap stories about their latest scrapes with the Ultramen amidst much laughter and camaraderie. Even newcomers like Pigmon find their place among friends who understand the unique struggles of being a fictional villain doomed to defeat. Though their days end in crushing losses, the monsters find solace and community at Kaijū Sakaba. Fueled by drinks and lively conversation, they regain the motivation needed to show up for tomorrow's battle, determined to prove themselves as worthy adversaries for their heroic foes. Ultimately, the Monster Bar provides these kaiju not only refreshing libations, but also the support and inspiration to keep chasing greater infamy.",
