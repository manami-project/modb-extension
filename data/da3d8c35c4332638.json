    "text": "Jikan transports you to the enchanting realm of Iblard, a lush fantasy world brimming with magical airships, floating islands, and luxurious villas nestled amidst vibrant hillsides of flowers and trees.

As dusk descends, will o' wisps dance playfully, and warm lights flicker, casting a soothing glow over the picturesque scenery.\n\nThis captivating visual journey, accompanied by a mesmerizing soundtrack of lilting melodies, invites you to explore the breathtaking artistry of Naohisa Inoue.
