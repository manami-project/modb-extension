  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Legends speak of a mysterious constellation of stars, visible only to martial artists of exceptional skill and strength. Akira Yuki, a dedicated student of Bajiquan under his grandfather's tutelage, once glimpsed these stars but has since lost the ability. In hopes of regaining this vision, Akira embarks on a globetrotting journey to challenge powerful fighters and learn the true meaning of strength. Along the way, he crosses paths with his friend Sarah Bryant, who is searching for her missing brother. The two become embroiled in an international conspiracy masterminded by the sinister Eva Durix and her organization Judgment 6. Using advanced robotics, Eva aims to engineer and control the perfect human weapon. When she sets her sights on Sarah as part of this plan, Akira steps up to confront Judgment 6 and rescue his friend. Facing lethal technology and unbeatable fighters, Akira pushes his skills to the limit. With the support of stalwart allies - including the wind master Jacky Bryant and Muay Thai prodigy Pai Chan - he confronts Judgment 6 in a series of epic showdowns. Only through perseverance, courage and trust in the bonds of friendship can Akira hope to save Sarah and uncover the secrets of the eight stars.",
