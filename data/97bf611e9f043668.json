  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aramaki Daisuke, a Public Security official, enlists the help of a full-body cybernetic hacker, Motoko Kusanagi, to investigate a bombing that occurred in Newport City in 2027, a year after the end of the non-nuclear World War IV. The explosion claimed the life of a prominent arms dealer, who may have been connected to the enigmatic 501 Organization. As Kusanagi delves deeper into the case, she finds herself working alongside a diverse team, including Batou, a \"Sleepless Eyes\" hacker who suspects Kusanagi of criminal activity, and Togusa, a Niihama Prefecture Police Detective who believes a series of prostitute murders are linked to the bombing. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Colonel Kurutsu of the 501 Organization keeps a close eye on Kusanagi. As the team uncovers the past of its members, they form a new Public Security organization known as Section 9. With Kusanagi no longer tied to the 501 Organization, she must learn to take orders from Aramaki. In a race against time, Batou seeks help from former army intelligence officer Ishikawa and former air artillery expert Borma, while Kusanagi aims to recruit ace sniper Saito and undercover cop Paz to join Section 9. The team finds themselves in a rivalry as they investigate a case involving a man with false memories of a refugee transport operation.",
