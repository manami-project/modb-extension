    "text": "Zwei, a young man with an erased past, finds himself entangled in the ruthless American underworld, where Mafia leaders are systematically eliminated. The ominous organization, Inferno, orchestrates these assassinations through their formidable weapon, a young woman known as Phantom, or Ein. After accidentally witnessing one of Ein's kills, Zwei's life takes a dramatic turn as he is captured, brainwashed, and transformed into Inferno's newest puppet.\n\nWith no memories of his former life, Zwei is thrust into a world of deception, brutality, and constant danger. His only chance of survival lies in embracing his new identity and learning the deadly arts of assassination from Ein herself. As they navigate the escalating Mafia violence together, Zwei and Ein form an unexpected bond. While they strive to endure in this unforgiving world, Zwei clings to the hope of rediscovering his lost past and rescuing Ein from her bloodstained future.",
