  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Inferno is a powerful and ruthless crime syndicate that rules the American underworld through fear and violence. When a young Japanese tourist witnesses one of Inferno's assassinations by their top hitwoman Phantom, his fate becomes inextricably tied to the organization. Stripped of his memories and identity, the man is given the codename Zwei and forced into training to become Inferno's newest assassin puppet. His mentor is none other than Phantom herself, now revealed as a girl named Ein. Over three grueling months, she molds Zwei into a meticulous killing machine ready to obey Inferno's every deadly command. As Mafia violence escalates, Zwei struggles to cling to his humanity while carrying out his masters' orders alongside the equally trapped Ein. In each other, the two lost assassins find their only ally. Zwei battles to unlock his suppressed memories and free himself from Inferno's clutches before it's too late. But being Phantom's apprentice also makes him a target, and every day brings him closer to the brink of death.",
