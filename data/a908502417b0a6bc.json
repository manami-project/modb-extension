  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shot at stardom in the US, Goro Honda, now known as Goro Shigeno, makes a fleeting return to his roots in Japan, specifically to Fukuoka, a city that holds significant memories from his fifth-grade baseball days. Having bid farewell to his friends and his life in Mifune, Goro finds himself in a new town, marking a pivotal juncture in his young life.\n\nNo sooner has he settled into his new school, than his exceptional baseball prowess is sought after by Hakata South, a little league team that has been on a losing streak for years. Led by a coach with a less-than-stellar attitude, the team welcomes Goro as their ace, a decision that stirs resentment among his teammates.\n\nBut Goro's challenges extend beyond the baseball field. His shoulder, a crucial asset to his game, is severely damaged, casting a shadow over his future in the sport. Simultaneously, unsettling developments within his adoptive family further complicate his life.\n\n\"Major: Yuujou no Winning Shot\" revisits Goro's formative years, filling in the gaps between the first and second seasons of the TV series, offering a compelling narrative of resilience, friendship, and the relentless pursuit of victory in the face of adversity.",
