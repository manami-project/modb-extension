  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the journey of Mash Kyrielight, a young girl who underwent an experiment by Chaldea to be fused with a Servant. We see Mash grow from a 10-year-old into an adolescent under the care of Dr. Romani Archaman, Chaldea's primary doctor assigned to her. As Mash spends time interacting with Romani and Chaldea's staff and trainees, she develops an interest in the word \"Senpai\" and a hope for the future. This hope sparks a wave that begins spreading. After some time passes, Mash prepares for her final mission - to travel back in time to ancient Mesopotamia to restore human history. Before departing, she fondly reminisces on all the Servants and heroes she met during her previous adventures through history. This anime reveals the background of Mash and Romani leading up to Mash's pivotal role in saving humanity. It offers viewers an origin story for this brave young girl who teams up with an insignificant mage to try and save the world.",
