    "text": "Tsubasa and his fellow elite soccer players from Japan are gearing up for the International Junior Youth Tournament in Paris, France. However, Tsubasa is temporarily sidelined by an injury, leaving his team to face off against the best soccer players from around the world without their star playmaker. The Japanese team will first gain international experience in test matches in Germany, including a match against Wakabayashi's Hamburg team. The tournament in France will feature fierce competition from players such as Germany's Schneider, France's Pierre, Argentina's Diaz, and Italy's Hernandez, among others. Will Tsubasa recover in time to lead his team to victory, or will they have to rely on their other talented players to emerge victorious? The battle for soccer supremacy is about to begin!",
