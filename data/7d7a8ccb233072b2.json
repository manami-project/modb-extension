  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyouko Todayama, a borderline delusional girl, leads a peculiar club at Ebisugawa High School. Newcomer Noya Itsuki, a space enthusiast, stumbles upon this club by mistake, thinking it's an Astronomy Club, only to find out it's actually the Asstronomy Clubâ€”a haven for eccentric female otakus.\n\nAs Itsuki navigates through the chaos of this club, he encounters a manga fanatic who frequently ends up in her underwear, a maid with a secret mission, and a cat serving as the faculty advisor. Adding to the chaos is a relentless enemy determined to disband the club.\n\nThe club's bizarre activities, filled with anime parodies and allusions, blur the line between reality and fantasy, pushing the Insane-O-Meter to its limits. Despite the madness, Itsuki remains oblivious to the fact that he's joined the wrong club.\n\nJoin Itsuki in this whirlwind of mayhem and delusion, where the Student Council's disapproval is the least of their worries, in the wild and wacky world of EBITEN!",
