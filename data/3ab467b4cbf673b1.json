  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kafka's haunting tale, \"A Country Doctor,\" is reimagined in this 20-minute anime by the daring and inventive Koji Yamamura, a previous Academy Award nominee. In the dead of winter, a doctor from a rural area receives an urgent call to treat a gravely ill young boy ten miles away. But with his horse frozen to death, the journey seems impossible until a mysterious stranger offers him otherworldly horses. As the doctor is transported to the patient's bedside, he becomes consumed by his personal troubles and resentment towards those he is duty-bound to heal. Unable to diagnose the boy's grotesque and life-threatening wound, the doctor faces ridicule from the villagers who demand miracles from him. Trapped in an endless journey, the doctor is stripped of everything in this surreal and thought-provoking exploration of society's expectations and the human psyche.",
