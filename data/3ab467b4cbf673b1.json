  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A country doctor receives an urgent late-night call to attend to a seriously ill young patient in a village ten miles away. However, with his horse dead in the icy winter weather, he lacks transportation to reach the patient. In a surreal twist, two unearthly horses and a mysterious coachman appear to carry the doctor swiftly through the night. Upon arriving at the village, the doctor discovers his young patient bears a gruesome, ultimately fatal wound. Distracted by his own grievances, the doctor fails to properly diagnose or treat the boy. The villagers, who expect the impossible from their doctor, react with hostility and humiliation. Condemned to endlessly repeat this nightmarish trip, the doctor grapples with his duties and the villagers' expectations amidst increasingly bizarre circumstances. Like much of Franz Kafka’s work, this abstract story uses absurd imagery to offer a darker commentary on society’s treatment of the tireless efforts of doctors.",
