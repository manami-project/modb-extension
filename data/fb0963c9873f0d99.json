Staz is actually an avid enthusiast of Japanese culture, spending his days engrossed in anime, manga, music, and video games. When a Japanese teenager, Fuyumi, accidentally stumbles into his domain, Staz's excitement knows no bounds. But as he grapples with the intrusion, Fuyumi falls prey to a monster and transforms into a wandering ghost. Determined to bring her back to life and explore the Human World, Staz embarks on a complex and unforeseen journey, encountering various obstacles and adventures along the way. With the help of a spatial magician and a half-werewolf, Staz and Fuyumi set out to find a magic that can resurrect humans, all while navigating the challenges that come with traversing the Demon and Human Worlds.",
