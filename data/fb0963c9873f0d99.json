  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Staz is a vampire who rules over a territory in the demon world, but he has little interest in behaving like a typical vampire. Instead of drinking blood, he spends his time indulging in Japanese pop culture like anime, manga, and video games. His peaceful life is disrupted when a human girl named Fuyumi accidentally stumbles into the demon world through a portal. Initially thrilled to meet someone from Japan, Staz's joy turns to horror as Fuyumi is killed by a monster right before his eyes. Her death deeply impacts the normally apathetic Staz and strengthens his desire to travel to the human world, which he's always dreamed of visiting. Fuyumi returns as a ghost, and the smitten Staz makes a vow to find a way to resurrect her, no matter what it takes. Teaming up with the magician Bell and half-werewolf Wolf, Staz embarks on a quest across the treacherous demon world and back into the human realm. Despite the obvious challenges, Staz remains determined to explore any avenue necessary - including dangerous magic - that could potentially restore Fuyumi's life. Blood, sweat, tears, and even his own life may be required sacrifices for Staz to achieve his goal of reviving the human girl who unwittingly captured his heart.",
