  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kei—and 46 others—discover immortality in the most unwelcome way. Instead of being hailed as superheroes, they're labeled as rare specimens, hunted by both the public and governments for endless experimentation. Kei's newfound immortality is a curse, forcing him to live—and die—repeatedly for the sake of human advancement.\n\nIn the thrilling conclusion of the Ajin film trilogy, Kei Nagai devises a plan as Satou's power wanes. But before his scheme can unfold, it begins to unravel. Ajin extremists make their move, and the terrifying true form of Satou is revealed.\n\n17 years ago, immortals first emerged on African battlefields. Since then, these mysterious lifeforms, known as Ajin, have occasionally appeared among humans. On the cusp of summer vacation, a Japanese high school student is fatally struck by a car. But instead of death, he finds himself revived—and wanted. Now, the boy must flee from the very humanity he once belonged to.",
