  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rin is a 17-year-old girl who lives a lonely existence inside a futuristic simulation that she controls with a tablet. Each day she awakens to craft new worlds, sheltering herself from the truth of her solitude. The simulation provides Rin an escape from reality. Though the virtual worlds she designs reflect her creative spirit, underneath the beauty lies heartache. Rin has no memories beyond the simulation and no contact with any other humans. As she engineers utopia after utopia, questions linger about the nature of her existence. Is she dreaming? Or is she unable to wake from the dream world she builds day after lonely day?",
