  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yoshiki and Hikaru were best friends who grew up together in a small village, spending most of their childhood inseparable. However, one fateful summer, Yoshiki noticed a disturbing change in Hikaru's personality and demeanor. Though Hikaru's physical appearance and memories remained the same, his behavior became threatening and erratic. During one confrontation, Hikaru partially transformed into an otherworldly being and professed his love for Yoshiki while also threatening to kill him if he couldn't accept this new version of his friend. It seems some supernatural force has taken over Hikaru. Strange occurrences now plague their village as Yoshiki struggles with grief over losing his friend yet still feels drawn to this dangerous new Hikaru. Though deeply unsettled, Yoshiki wishes to remain by his side, clinging to the hope that his real friend still exists somewhere deep down. But with chaos enveloping their home, Yoshiki faces a precarious and emotionally fraught situation in trying to support this unpredictable imposter who wears his best friend's face.",
