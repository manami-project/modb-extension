    "text": "Ozuma Lee, the courageous leader of the S.M.S. Skull Team, finds himself in the year 2059, five decades after the devastating Space War I, aboard the 25th New Macross Class super-long-distance colonization fleet, Macross Frontier. The fleet is on a mission to find a new utopia in the vast galaxy, but their journey is fraught with danger as they engage in a fierce war against an enigmatic enemy, the Vajra.\n\nAs the conflict rages on, Ozuma encounters an unusual lifeform, unlike anything he's seen before, even compared to the Vajra. This entity shares vivid memories with Ozuma, his stepsibling Ranka Lee, and her companion, Sheryl Nome, revealing glimpses of another colonization fleet's experiences.\n\nMeanwhile, Macross FB7, the 30th-anniversary celebration of the Macross franchise, delves into the enigmatic war between Macross 7, the Sound Forces, and the Proto Devil. As Ozuma receives a cryptic tape about the war, he and his comrades begin to unravel the truth behind Nekki Basara, the elusive lead singer of the legendary band, Fire Bomber.\n\nJoin Ozuma and his allies as they navigate the perils of space, uncover hidden truths, and face formidable adversaries in this thrilling installment of the Macross saga.",
