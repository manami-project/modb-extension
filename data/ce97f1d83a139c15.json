  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Danemon, a valiant hero, embarks on a mission to exorcise a haunted castle after seeing a notice that promises a suitable reward. Upon his arrival, he encounters a group of cunning Tanuki who, with their impressive shape-shifting abilities, disguise themselves as beautiful women to distract him from his quest. However, the Tanuki underestimate Danemon's strength and prowess, leading to a swift turn of events in his favor. This 1935 short film, which was initially released as a talkie, showcases Danemon's thrilling battles against monsters and beasts. With its original audio, this extended version promises an engaging and action-packed experience.",
