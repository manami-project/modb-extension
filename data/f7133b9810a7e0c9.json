  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Each season brings new adventures for the Ai Tenshi, as they navigate life two years after their epic battle against Reine Devila. Momoko, Yuri, Hinagiku, and Scarlet have returned to their normal lives, with no memory of their past as Love Angels - except for Momoko's mother, Sakura, and Jamapi. But when Momoko's letter to Yousuke attracts a rogue demon, the Ai Tenshi are forced to reunite and defend the human realm once again.\n\nWith the help of Aphrodite, the goddess of love, the four friends regain their memories and set out on a new mission to maintain peace and defeat those who seek to destroy it. These four OVAs, each featuring a different Ai Tenshi and season, are uniquely designed and scripted, with a slightly different art style from the original series.\n\nFrom Wedding Peach's summer escapades to Angel Lily's springtime adventures, the Ai Tenshi face new challenges and foes. But with their powers restored and their friendship stronger than ever, they're ready to take on whatever comes their way. Will they be able to keep the peace and protect the human realm once again? Join the Ai Tenshi on their latest adventures and find out!",
