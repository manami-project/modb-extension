    "text": "Subaru Sumeragi is the young head of the Sumeragi clan, a family of powerful onmyouji (yin-yang magicians) who protect spirits and souls. Along with his twin sister Hokuto and his friend Seishiro Sakurazuka, also an onmyouji, Subaru uses his spiritual abilities to investigate supernatural crimes and paranormal events in Tokyo. When Subaru's employer mysteriously dies during an exorcism, the only suspect is a man who keeps improbably surviving deadly situations. A young woman intent on cursing this man approaches Subaru for help, believing he killed her brother. To solve the mystery of his employer's death and confront the dark forces protecting the suspect, Subaru taps into the Sumeragi clan's ancient knowledge of the occult. As Subaru delves deeper into Tokyo's supernatural underworld, he crosses paths with a dangerous serial killer haunting the subways. When the killer sets his sights on Subaru's spiritual ally, the onmyouji races to save her life. With the help of Hokuto and Seishiro, Subaru must stop the subway murderer and free Tokyo from these threatening paranormal forces.",
