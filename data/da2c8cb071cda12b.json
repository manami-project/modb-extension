    "text": "It is the 22nd century and Tokyo has been destroyed by earthquakes, leading to the construction of a new city called Bayside. Bayside serves as Japan's main overseas port but has attracted terrorists who frequently attack citizens. To combat this threat, private security companies are hired to fight terrorism. One such firm is the Angel Arms Company, founded by former policewoman Takako. Angel Arms consists of six women who utilize armored suits to capture criminals. Their latest case involves protecting captured arms dealer Ali Jaheeve Hassan until his sentencing. However, this mission dredges up the past for Angel Arms member Alisa when she realizes the terrorists' leader is her former lover. Alisa must decide whether to remain with Angel Arms or abandon her new life to reconnect with her old flame. Meanwhile, the terrorists aim to assassinate Hassan and eliminate Angel Arms with newly-acquired advanced weaponry. With lives on the line, Angel Arms races to uncover the identity of the mysterious terrorist leader and thwart the deadly plots targeting them and their city.",
