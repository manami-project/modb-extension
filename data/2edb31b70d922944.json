    "text": "One dedicated office worker, Fushihara-san, finds herself working relentlessly day and night, prompting the resident office ghost, a charming little girl, to intervene. The ghost's initial attempts to scare Fushihara-san away from her overtime habit backfire when the office worker becomes enamored with the ghost's cuteness. Instead of leaving, Fushihara-san finds solace in the company of the adorable spirit, who regularly brings her refreshments and provides a much-needed distraction from her demanding job. As their bond deepens, the once overworked Fushihara-san begins to experience a heartwarming transformation, discovering joy and healing in the most unexpected of friendships.",
