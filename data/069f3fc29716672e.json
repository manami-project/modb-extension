  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tomoya Okazaki is a resentful high school student who has a distant relationship with his father ever since his mother passed away in a tragic accident. While walking to school one day, he meets an older student named Nagisa Furukawa who is repeating a year due to illness. The two begin spending time together and Tomoya slowly finds his bitter outlook on life shifting as their friendship develops. In an alternate storyline, Tomoya is dating the headstrong Tomoyo Sakagami. When Tomoyo becomes Student Council President, she sets her sights on saving the school's cherry blossom trees from being cut down. However, negative rumors circulate about Tomoya and Tomoyo's relationship due to his delinquent status. As Tomoyo becomes consumed with her presidential duties, their romance is put to the test by disapproving school officials and peers who threaten to tear them apart. The core story follows a burgeoning connection between two initially lonely youths, while the alternate universe explores the tribulations faced by an ostracized couple determined to stay together against the odds. Though diverging in plot details, both narratives share poignant themes of hard-won trust and compassion.",
