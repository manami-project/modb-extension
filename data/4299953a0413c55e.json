  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Athletic waitresses engage in a high-stakes, no-holds-barred fighting tournament known as Variable Geo (VG), where the victors claim millions in cash and the defeated face utter humiliation and loss of their clothing. For these underpaid, yet muscular, waitresses, VG offers a golden opportunity to earn quick money. However, beneath the thrilling surface of this extreme sport lie sinister forces and unethical practices. Deadly injections make performance-enhancing drugs look harmless, and team prayers are replaced by demonic possessions. The corporate sponsors of the event are ruthless organizations with hidden agendas more terrifying than mere market dominance.\n\nYuka and Satomi, lifelong friends turned rivals, find themselves working as waitresses. Yuka joins VG to showcase her fighting prowess and earn millions, while Satomi is compelled to participate to pay for her sick brother's surgery. The two friends must now face each other in the ring, with Satomi risking public shame if she loses. In this futuristic world, waitresses battle for honor, respect, and a fortune, but the losers stand to lose everything, including their dignity and attire.",
