  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Attack on Titan OADs consist of three side stories independent of the main plot. The first OAD, \"Ilse's Notebook: Memoirs of a Scout Regiment Member,\" focuses on Hange Zoe of the Scout Regiment. During an expedition beyond the walls, Hange discovers the journal of Ilse, a scout who died a year prior. The journal contains revelations about the Titans that aid the Scouts in their battle. The second OAD, \"The Sudden Visitor: The Torturous Curse of Youth,\" depicts a cooking competition between Jean Kirstein and Sasha Blouse of the 104th Trainee Squad. The competition is held at the behest of a drunk Commander Pyxis and is meant to settle a dispute between Jean and Sasha. The third OAD, \"Distress,\" shows a training exercise gone wrong for members of the 104th, including Christa, Ymir, Reiner, Bertholdt, Jean, Marco and Eren. When Christa is taken hostage, Jean and Eren have to work together to track down the perpetrators and save her despite not having their maneuver gear. Overall, the OADs provide backstory on certain characters while also depicting memorable incidents separate from the main Attack on Titan storyline. Their self-contained nature allows them to showcase the characters and world in a more lighthearted manner.",
