The diary, penned by Ilse Langnar, reveals unexpected insights into the mysterious Titans, sparking Zoe's determination to capture a live specimen for research. Despite the risks, Zoe's pursuit of knowledge drives her to lure a Titan, leading to unforeseen consequences.\n\nCulinary Clash: In a bid to settle a dispute, Jean Kirstein and Sasha Blouse, members of the 104th Trainee Squad, engage in an unconventional battle - a cooking competition. Under the watchful eye of their drunken commander, the two trainees, along with their respective teams, swap their combat gear for kitchen utensils, turning the heat up in the kitchen instead of the battlefield.\n\nUnited in Crisis: Before the 104th Training Corps became a unified force, a training exercise goes awry, leading to Christa being taken hostage. With their mobility gear out of the question, Jean and Eren are forced to set aside their differences and work together to rescue their comrade and apprehend the perpetrators.
