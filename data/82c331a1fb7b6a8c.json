    "text": "Morte, a solitary beauty with a score to settle, is driven by vengeance after her brother's death in the war between humans and beastmen. She joins forces with Kyrie, a nomadic chef who may hold the key to activating the Destruct Code, an enigmatic orb with the potential to annihilate everything in existence. In a world where humans are subjugated by beastmen, and sand replaces water and fire, Kyrie becomes the unwitting recruit of the World Destruction Committee, led by Morte, to bring an end to their world. Along with Toppi, an aspiring hero and beastman, the trio embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Destruct Code, all while evading the World Salvation Committee. Will they succeed in their mission to destroy the world, or will they uncover a different path? The fate of the world rests in their hands.",
