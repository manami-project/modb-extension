  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Adulthood is a predetermined path in a future society governed by a central computer, where humans are birthed in labs and conditioned to serve the system. Earth, now a distant memory and referred to as Terra, bears the scars of humanity's past mistakes. Jomy Marcus Shin, a seemingly ordinary 14-year-old, faces the day his memories will be erased to better serve this controlled utopia. But when he discovers he possesses telepathic abilities, making him a Mu—a being feared and hunted by the government—his life takes an unexpected turn.\n\nAs both the government and the Mu race to find him, Jomy learns of his true identity as an esper and the next leader of the Mu. With his newfound powers and the memories of the former Mu leader, Soldier Blue, guiding him, Jomy must decide between preserving the Mu's hidden existence or waging war against humanity to reclaim Terra, their ancestral home. Caught between two worlds, Jomy's choices will not only determine the Mu's future but also challenge the very foundation of this seemingly perfect society.",
