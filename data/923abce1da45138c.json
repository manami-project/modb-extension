  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Legend ary animator Tezuka Osamu presents a poignant tale set in a post-apocalyptic world, where the remnants of humanity's conveniences lie in the form of futuristic vending machines. In this wasteland, a lone, disheveled man embarks on a journey, traversing the desolate landscape in his battered car. With just a push of a button, these extraordinary machines dispense everything from stylish clothing and sleek vehicles to loyal companions and even water. Yet, the man yearns for something far more precious than these material possessions â€“ a new Earth.\n\nOriginally intended as a replacement for \"The Legend of the Forest\" at the Hiroshima International Animation Festival, this four-minute short film showcases the protagonist's quest to meet the enigmatic creator. In his pursuit, the man discovers that there's one thing these miraculous machines cannot provide: a brand new Earth. The creator gently refuses his request, underscoring the profound despair Osamu feels for the degradation of our planet. This simple yet powerful story serves as a stark reminder of the irreplaceable value of our home, Earth.",
