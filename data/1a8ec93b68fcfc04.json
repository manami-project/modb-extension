In a desperate bid to escape the oppressive dystopian reality, Zed seeks an alternate world, believing that his unwavering determination will lead him to a gateway.\n\nOne day, Zed is mysteriously transported to a lush, magical realm where Shard Casters, powerful warriors, wield enchanted crystals called Shards.
