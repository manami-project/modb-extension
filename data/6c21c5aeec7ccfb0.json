  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Quindecim, a peculiar bar, becomes an unexpected destination for two men who find themselves there with no recollection of their arrival. Greeted by a young woman, they are led to the bar where a bartender reveals their only path to departure: participating in a game chosen by roulette, with dire consequences for refusal. The stakes are high, as they're told to play as if their lives hang in the balance. The game? Billiards. But this isn't your average game of pool; the outcome could quite literally determine life or death. As part of the '2012 Young Animator Training Project', Death Billiards brings a thrilling twist to the traditional game of billiards, where each shot could be the players' last.",
