As she pursues her sworn enemy, Lemnear uncovers a hidden power within herself, one that could save the ancient world from the clutches of evil. But the Dark Lord, the mastermind behind Gardein, has his sights set on Lemnear's newfound power, turning her quest for revenge into a desperate struggle for the fate of the world.
