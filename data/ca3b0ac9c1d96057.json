    "text": "Ryugu Elementary School was once a prestigious institution well-known for nurturing talented characters. However, when ordinary boy Meisaku Matsuda enrolls, he finds himself surrounded by a class of quirky misfits. There's Sweets, an energetic simpleton; Musubi, a rice ball with an identity complex; Nokio, a self-absorbed robot wannabe; and Bolt, a speedster quicker than a rabbit. Overwhelmed at first, Meisaku wonders if he will ever fit in amongst these crazy classmates. Yet perhaps with some wacky adventures at this unorthodox school, he too can become a masterpiece character. Can Meisaku graduate from Ryugu by learning to embrace the creative spirit of its delightfully offbeat student body?",
