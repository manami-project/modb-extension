Meisaku dreams of graduating as a celebrated character, but his journey is far from ordinary. The school is a melting pot of eccentric personalities, each more unique than the last. Among them are Sweets, an energetic yet dim-witted character, Musubi, a rice ball with a fiery temper when labeled as 'onigiri', Nokio, a self-absorbed entity who identifies as a robot, and Bolt, whose speed outpaces any rabbit. As Meisaku navigates through this whirlwind of peculiarities, the question remains: Can he rise above the chaos and become the masterpiece character he aspires to be?",
