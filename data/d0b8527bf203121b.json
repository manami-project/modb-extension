    "text": "Being a young witch-in-training, Kiki, at the tender age of thirteen, embarks on a journey of self-discovery and independence as part of her witch tradition. With her loyal black cat, Jiji, and her mother's broomstick, she leaves behind her family and friends to spend a year in a distant coastal town called Koriko. Upon her arrival, Kiki faces challenges adapting to her new environment and struggles to find a place to stay. However, an opportunity arises when she meets Osono, who offers her a place to live in exchange for making deliveries for her bakery. Recognizing the potential of her flying abilities, Kiki establishes her own broomstick courier service, paving the way for exciting experiences and valuable lessons in responsibility and self-reliance. As she navigates through her new life, Kiki learns the true meaning of independence and forges friendships that help her find her place in the world.",
