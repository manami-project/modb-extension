    "text": "Suwa and Kurusu, two professional assassins with contrasting personalities, find their lives turned upside down when they cross paths with a four-year-old girl named Miri on Christmas Eve. Miri, who is on a quest to find her father, unwittingly stumbles into their latest mission, leading to an unexpected twist in their lives.\n\nKurusu, an outgoing gambler, and Suwa, a reserved video game enthusiast, decide to take Miri under their wing, despite the potential risks to their careers. As they navigate the challenges of parenthood, they discover that raising a child is far more demanding than any mission they've undertaken.\n\nMiri's innocence and unpredictable nature quickly endear her to the duo, who both assume the role of 'papa'. Despite their dangerous lifestyle and the complications that arise from Miri being the secret love child of a mafia boss they eliminated, they strive to provide her with a normal childhood.\n\nAs they juggle their responsibilities as assassins and parents, they embark on a journey filled with chaos, laughter, and love. Can they successfully balance their dangerous professions with their newfound roles as parents? Only time will tell if this unconventional family can find happiness amidst the chaos.",
