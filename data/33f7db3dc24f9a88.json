  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With over 90 members, the Kitauji High School concert band is buzzing with energy as they embark on their final high school year under the leadership of their new president, Kumiko Oumae. After a disappointing 'dud gold' at the Kansai competition in their second year, the band is more determined than ever to clinch the coveted gold medal at the national competition.\n\nAs Kumiko navigates her new role, she finds herself facing unexpected challenges, including self-doubt and the pressure of being the club's decision-maker. But with the guidance of their teacher, Taki Noboru, and the support of her friends, she is determined to lead the band to new heights.\n\nAdding to the mix is the arrival of Mayu Kuroe, a talented euphonium player and transfer student from Seira Girls' School, a regular at the national competition. While Mayu's gentle demeanor and impressive skills make her a welcome addition to the band, Kumiko can't shake off a strange feeling about her.\n\nWith the stakes higher than ever, the band must come together and overcome their personal and collective challenges to achieve their long-desired goal. Will Kumiko be able to rise to the occasion and lead the band to victory in her final year at Kitauji High School? Only time will tell.",
