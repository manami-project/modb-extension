    "text": "Light dreamed of becoming an adventurer, but fate had other plans. When he visited the temple to receive his skill fruit, he ended up with the lackluster Nut Master ability instead of something heroic. Though disappointed, Light resigns himself to life as a humble farmer. However, Light soon discovers his unique skill allows him to consume additional skill fruits without dying. With each new fruit, Light unlocks incredible new powers beyond his wildest dreams. He goes from zero to hero, transforming from a talentless farmer into the mightiest adventurer the world has ever seen. With his astonishing strength, Light attracts a band of devoted allies. Together, they set off on thrilling adventures, battling evil monsters and warring clans. Though once looked down upon, Light now receives the admiration and affections of people across the land. This is the legendary tale of an underdog who beat the odds to become the ultimate overpowered hero. Light's nutty skill proves that one's destiny can blossom in the most unexpected ways.",
