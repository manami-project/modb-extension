  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akina's downhill racing scene has a new reigning champion in Takumi Fujiwara, who has been unbeaten in his AE86. However, his supremacy is threatened by the arrival of the formidable Emperors, a racing team that exclusively drives the powerful and agile Mitsubishi Lancer Evolutions. The Emperors have a ruthless driving style and a tradition of collecting decals from the teams they defeat, making them a force to be reckoned with. Led by Kyouichi Sudou, who looks down on Takumi for driving an outdated car, the Emperors aim to conquer the entire Gunma region in just one month. With the odds stacked against him, Takumi must push his AE86 to its limits and prove that skill can triumph over mechanical superiority. Will Takumi's legendary status be shattered, or will he rise to the challenge and defeat the Emperors?",
