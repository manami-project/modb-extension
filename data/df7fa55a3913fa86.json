    "text": "French farm girl Jeanne and her beloved Jean are eager to start their life together as husband and wife. However, their dreams are shattered when the local baron demands an unpayable tax for their union. In a cruel twist of fate, Jeanne is brutally violated by the baron and his cronies as compensation. Devastated and seeking vengeance, Jeanne is lured into a dark alliance with a demonic entity that promises her power and retribution. As she delves deeper into the forbidden world of witchcraft and orgies, Jeanne's life takes a surreal and erotic turn. But as her power grows, so does the suspicion and envy of those around her. In the end, Jeanne must pay the ultimate price for her pact with the devil. Set in the Middle Ages, this psychedelic arthouse film is a haunting tale of love, lust, and revenge.",
