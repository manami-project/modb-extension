    "text": "Set in medieval France, Kanashimi no Belladonna tells the tragic tale of Jeanne, a peasant bride who is raped by the cruel local baron on her wedding night when her husband Jean cannot pay the demanded bridal tax. Haunted by trauma, Jeanne spirals into despair and is visited by a mysterious demon who promises her the power of witchcraft in exchange for her soul. Accepting the bargain, Jeanne immerses herself in a world of dark magic, using her occult powers to seduce and manipulate the townspeople. Dabbling in witchcraft and seeking vengeance, she incites superstition and envy in the village. But ultimately, Jeanne realizes too late that making a deal with the devil comes at a steep price. This avant-garde, psychedelic anime explores mature themes of sexuality, revenge, and corruption against the starkly beautiful backdrop of the Middle Ages.",
