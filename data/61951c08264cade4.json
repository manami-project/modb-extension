    "text": "Now here is the excitement more palpable than at Yokosuka Girls' Marine High School, as it prepares to host an annual tournament involving three other maritime high schools. Amidst the festivities, the students of the Harekaze find themselves in the thick of unexpected challenges. Mashiro, the executive officer, is grappling with the prospect of becoming the captain of the battleship Hiei, a decision that could separate her from her friends aboard the Harekaze. Meanwhile, the crew is introduced to a mysterious young girl named Suu, whose presence seems to be intertwined with a looming threat.\n\nAs the town revels in the spirit of the tournament, a group of pirates seizes control of a heavily-armed seafort, posing a grave danger to Japan. With the safety of the city hanging in the balance, the students must rise to the occasion and face the enemy head-on. For Akeno, the captain of the Harekaze, and Mashiro, the stakes are higher than ever as they navigate their personal dilemmas while leading their crew against the pirates. As the battle unfolds, the students of the Harekaze must find the courage and strength to protect their city and the bonds that unite them.",
