  "synopsis": {
    "text": "African-American samurai Yasuke, once a slave turned skilled warrior under the tutelage of the legendary General Nobunaga Oda, now seeks solace in a humble life as a boatman in a war-torn, feudal Japan where magic and mechs coexist. Tormented by the memories of his master's tragic death and haunted by nightmares, Yasuke finds solace in alcohol.\n\nWhen a desperate plea from the local village's bar singer, Ichika, reaches him, Yasuke is reluctantly pulled back into a world of danger and violence. Ichika's daughter, Saki, is gravely ill and requires a doctor who resides upriver to the north. Yasuke agrees to transport her, but their journey is fraught with peril as they face hostile daimyo soldiers and menacing mechas.\n\nAs the village becomes a battleground for warring daimyo, Yasuke discovers that Saki is more than just an ailing child; she is a target of dark forces and ruthless warlords. With the fate of the village and the mysterious child in his hands, Yasuke must once again embrace his past as a formidable samurai to protect the innocent and confront the evil that threatens their very existence.",
