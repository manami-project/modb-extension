    "text": "Through the changing seasons, Ryota Satou, Chika Koizumi, and their fellow fifth-grade classmates navigate the ups and downs of elementary school life in this heartwarming anime. From summer bug hunts and poolside antics to autumn leaf-viewing and winter snowball battles, the friends find excitement and laughter in everyday activities. But as spring arrives, so too does a shift in their dynamics, leaving almost no one unaffected. Based on the popular manga \"Kyou no Go no Ni,\" this OVA shares the same talented staff and cast as its TV anime counterpart, promising a delightful and entertaining watch. Join Ryota, Chika, and their friends in class 5-2 as they make lasting memories and forge unbreakable bonds.",
