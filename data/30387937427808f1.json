On a cold Christmas Eve, their lives take a dramatic turn when they stumble upon an abandoned baby in a garbage dump.

With only a mysterious key and a single note as clues, the trio embarks on a journey filled with danger, humor, and unexpected encounters. As they navigate the vast city, they find themselves entangled in a series of events, from kidnapping to mysterious red envelopes. Along the way, they confront their own pasts, revisiting their haunted memories, and learning to face their futures.
