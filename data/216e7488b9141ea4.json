    "text": "Even though Nike, the fourth princess of the Rain Dukedom, possesses the unique ability to summon rain, she finds herself journeying to the Sun Kingdom to marry its young king, Livius. This unexpected union is not driven by love, but by Nike's duty to her people and her homeland. Livius, who managed to conquer the world in a mere three years following his ascension to the throne, is surprisingly still a child. In this sun-drenched kingdom where rain is an unfamiliar concept, Livius develops an intriguing fascination with Nike's rain-summoning power. As misconceptions about Livius's supposed tyranny begin to unravel, a heartwarming tale unfolds, chronicling the blossoming bond between this unusual couple.",
