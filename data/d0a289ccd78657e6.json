  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After defeating Naga and restoring Vestroia, Danma Kuusou and his Pyrus Dragonoid found peace on New Vestroia. However, this peace was short-lived as alien invaders called Vestals arrived and conquered the Bakugan world. The Vestals aimed to enslave Bakugan for entertainment using a machine that restricted them into ball form. In response, a resistance group called the Bakugan Battle Brawlers Resistance formed, consisting of humans, Bakugans, and Vestals who opposed Bakugan enslavement. Led by Danma, they ventured into enemy territory to free New Vestroia and ensure Bakugan survival. Later, Dragonoid returned to Earth with a Vestal ally named Mira, revealing that five Bakugans who previously helped restore Vestroia had now been captured. A group of humans called the Vexos were also beginning to take over New Vestroia, and they now targeted Dragonoid. Believing he would gain power from uniting with Dan and the Battle Brawlers, Dragonoid aimed to free both his friends and New Vestroia from the Vexos oppression. Ultimately, Danma, Chouji, Dragonoid and the Bakugan Resistance united to battle the evil Vestals, destroy their plans for domination, and restore peace and freedom to New Vestroia. Through this newly forged friendship, they continued the fight to liberate their enslaved planet.",
