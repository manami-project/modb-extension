  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Eleven Kings of Sol, a formidable new enemy, emerges after the Gutsy Galaxy Guard (GGG) triumphs over the Zonder Empire and the 31 Primevals. GGG, led by Guy Shishio and armed with the newly built GaoFighGar, joins forces with their French ally, Chasseur, to combat BioNet, a nefarious organization seeking to misuse the enigmatic Q-parts technology. Among Chasseur's ranks is Renais Cardiff Shishioh, a former BioNet cyborg with a personal vendetta against those who robbed her of her humanity. As the conflict escalates, GGG's bases are attacked, and the original Gao Machines and Q-parts are stolen by Mamoru Amami, who has been kidnapped and cloned by the Eleven Kings of Sol. With the United Nations evicting GGG from Earth, they must embark on a perilous journey through the galaxy to confront the Eleven Kings of Sol, rescue Mamoru, and safeguard humanity's future. Meanwhile, in a snowy Paris, a mysterious robot invasion unfolds, with Gimlet, a metal cyborg of BioNet, summoning a colossal robot powered by Q-parts. Evoluder Guy, the leader of GGG's mobile troop, transforms into Brave King GaoGaiGer to confront the mechanical menace, leading to an unexpected turn of events.",
