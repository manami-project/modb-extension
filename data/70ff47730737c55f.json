    "text": "After defeating the Zonder Empire and 31 Primevals, the Gutsy Galaxy Guard (GGG) faces new threats on Earth. They battle the crime syndicate BioNet, who uses mysterious \"Q-Parts\" technology. Among BioNet's enemies is the French group Chasseur, including former cyborg Renais Cardiff seeking revenge. Just as GGG and Chasseur combat BioNet, GGG's bases worldwide are attacked. The recently found Q-Parts and Gao Machines are stolen by Mamoru Amami, GGG member Guy Shishio's friend. Mamoru was abducted and cloned by the greater threat \"Eleven Kings of Sol.\" Evicted from Earth, GGG voyages across the galaxy to save Mamoru from the Eleven Kings, who plan to zonderize the universe. GGG must defeat these new enemies with help from old friends, combining their courage, advanced vehicles and AI robots like Galeon. With humanity's fate at stake, GGG wages an all-out war for victory.",
