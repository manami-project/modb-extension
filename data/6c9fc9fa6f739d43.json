  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Titans and the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) engage in a fierce battle during the final days of the Gryps conflict in the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam universe. Amidst this chaos, siblings Asagi and Takuya find themselves aboard a civilian transport destined for Earth. As they become entangled in the crossfire, the duo faces the daunting task of navigating their ship through atmospheric entry.\n\nFortunately, they receive unexpected assistance from a custom-painted Zeta Gundam, whose pilot bears a striking resemblance to the legendary One Year War hero, Amuro Ray. Initially designed as a unique immersive experience, this story unfolds across three screens simultaneously, combining animation and CG to create an atmosphere akin to an IMAX or OmniMAX theatre.\n\nDecades later, in 2023, this thrilling adventure is incorporated into the Mobile Suit Gundam U.C. ENGAGE mobile game, allowing players to witness the siblings' daring journey. Will Asagi and Takuya successfully guide their ship through the perilous atmospheric entry with the help of the mysterious Zeta Gundam pilot? Only time will tell.",
