Equipped with powerful tentacles, ink-spitting abilities, and bioluminescence, she seems unstoppable. However, her grand plans of world domination quickly hit a snag when she encounters the Aizawa siblings, who run the Lemon Beach House restaurant.

As she interacts with the quirky patrons and forms new friendships, her single-minded focus on vengeance begins to waver. Despite her setbacks, Ika Musume remains determined to make a statement against humanity's careless disregard for the ocean. Will she ultimately succeed in her mission, or will the charming world above the waves captivate her heart?
