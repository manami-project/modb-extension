    "text": "When love strikes, it's impossible to ignore, and for high-powered businessman Amakusa Ryou, it hits him like a ton of bricks when he encounters his younger sister's best friend, Arima Ichika. A chance meeting on a rainy day sparks an intense infatuation in Ryou, who is used to getting any woman he wants. However, Ichika isn't like other girls, and she finds his advances creepy and off-putting. Despite her constant rejections and insults, Ryou is convinced that she's just playing hard to get, and he becomes even more determined to win her heart. This romantic comedy follows the hilarious and awkward encounters between a suave businessman and a typical high school otaku girl as they navigate the treacherous waters of love. Will Ryou's persistence pay off, or will Ichika continue to resist his charms? Only time will tell in this hilarious and heartwarming tale of love and persistence.",
