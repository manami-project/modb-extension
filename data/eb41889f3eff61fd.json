  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ten years ago, detective Kogoro Mouri helped arrest a murderous card dealer named Jo Murakami. Now released from prison, Murakami begins targeting people connected to Mouri in an act of revenge. The victims all have playing card numbers in their names and are being attacked in descending order - starting with King down to Ace. As the assaults turn deadly, Conan realizes there's more to the story than meets the eye. The case also leads Ran to learn surprising details about her parents' separation a decade prior. With lives at stake, Conan races to uncover the truth behind the attacks, how they tie back to the past, and identify the next potential victims. This thrilling detective story blends a high-stakes race against a vengeful criminal with a deeply personal journey into Ran's family history. As the mystery unravels, Conan once again relies on his superb deductive skills to crack the case and stop tragedy before it's too late.",
