  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shirasu—the woman behind the lens of the iconic photograph that sparked hope for peace in the war-ravaged mountains of Uddiyana—is once again called to document the unfolding events. The image of a makeshift UN flag, raised high by civilians, became a symbol of unity and catalyzed a UN-backed peace agreement. However, just as the peace accord was about to be finalized, the flag was stolen by an extremist faction, threatening to derail the truce. In response, the UN dispatches the Special Development Command (SDC) unit, equipped with the cutting-edge High Agility Versatile Weapon Carrier (HAVWC), to retrieve the flag and combat the armed factions. Saeko Shirasu, now a renowned photojournalist, is tasked with following the SDC unit, capturing their struggles, and unveiling the truth behind the conflict. Join Shirasu as she documents the trials and tribulations of the SDC unit and their mission to restore peace to the people of Uddiyana.",
