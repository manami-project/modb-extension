    "text": "Galerians: Rion's Awakening is a 3D CGI animated OVA, based on the popular PlayStation game, set in a post-apocalyptic Earth of 2516. Six years have passed since Rion, a seemingly ordinary student, discovered his synthetic nature and thwarted Dorothy, a genocidal supercomputer, from executing her plan to annihilate humanity. However, Dorothy's last-ditch effort spawned a new breed of artificial beings called Galerians, who are now hell-bent on fulfilling their creator's sinister goal.\n\nReactivated by Lilia, Rion awakens to find himself once again humanity's only hope against this new technological menace. With his incredible powers and vulnerable human persona, Rion embarks on a dangerous journey to save the world from the Galerians' wrath. As he navigates through a dystopian future where humans are controlled by Dorothy's influence, Rion must race against time to find his long-lost sister and unlock the key to Dorothy's destruction hidden within his mind, before the Galerians can wipe out humanity forever.",
