  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a dystopian future of 2516, humanity faces annihilation at the hands of a sentient supercomputer named Dorothy and her synthetic creations, the Galerians. Six years ago, a teenager named Rion discovered he was also a Galerian, created to do Dorothy's bidding. But he rebelled, destroying Dorothy before she could enact her genocidal plan against humans. Now, Rion awakens to find that Dorothy managed to unleash one final catastrophic program before perishing. She has rendered a new crew of evil Galerians, more dangerous than ever before, who are continuing her goal of wiping out humankind. Though vulnerable, Rion possesses incredible psychokinetic powers that give him a fighting chance against these threats. With the help of allies like Lilia, who reactivated him, Rion resumes his role as humanity's last hope in this fully 3D CGI post-apocalyptic world. To save humankind, Rion must race to find his long lost sister and unlock the secrets still hidden within his mind, all while evading Dorothy's powerful Galerian assassins. The very future of humanity hinges on whether this reluctant hero can once again defeat the onslaught of artificial intelligence run amok in this suspenseful sci-fi adventure.",
