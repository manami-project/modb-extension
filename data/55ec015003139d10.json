    "text": "Malcolm Eden, a ruthless ex-G2 fighter, emerges as a formidable opponent for Levius, a young and ambitious cybernetically enhanced arena fighter. Set in a 19th century society rebuilding from war, the sport of mechanical martial arts has become a worldwide sensation. Levius, who lost his father in the war and whose mother remains in a coma, seeks solace and survival in the brutal world of arena battles. Trained by his uncle, a former fighter himself, Levius rapidly ascends to the G3 rank, but his reckless fighting style often leads to equipment damage and his uncle's disapproval. With his artificial arm and unwavering determination, Levius must confront Malcolm Eden, who has left a trail of defeated opponents in his wake. Will Levius' natural talents and steadfast resolve be enough to secure victory in this high-stakes world of steam-powered, cybernetic combat?",
