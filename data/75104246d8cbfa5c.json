    "text": "This coming-of-age drama follows a group of adolescent girls attending an all-girls musical boarding school in Japan. Through shifting perspectives and timelines, the series recounts their formative years at the school, known as the \"boarding house,\" where students from across Japan gather to hone their talents on the stage. We meet several central characters, each with their own dreams and motivations: Wakana, who aspires to stardom; housemaster Kinue, carrying on her late best friend's dreams; beautiful scholarship student Emi, constantly in the spotlight; and teacher Katsurako, formerly of an acting family. The boarding house proves a complex backdrop, both nurturing the artistic passions of these budding talents as well as pitting them against one another in fierce competition. Success requires perseverance through harsh realities, bringing out the best and worst in the girls. Still, bonds are forged, dreams slowly realized, and womanhood ushered in through their shared experiences. With nuanced character writing and psychological depth, the series promises an intimate look at the inner lives of its ensemble cast against the high-stakes setting of this musical proving ground.",
