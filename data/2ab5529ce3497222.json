  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This unique hybrid anime blends live-action and animation to tell an amusing story from an unexpected perspective - that of a colony of cockroaches. They have made their home in the messy apartment of a bachelor named Saito, who kindly allows them to live there without fear of extermination. Led by their wise professor, the roaches of the Hosino tribe enjoy an easy life with abundant food and fun games. However, their happy existence gets disrupted when Saito begins bringing his new girlfriend over. Unlike Saito, she is not at all enthusiastic about sharing the apartment with creepy crawlies. The roaches now face an uncertain future and must adapt to changes in their environment in order to preserve their colony. With elements of comedy and drama, this clever anime promises an entertaining look at an unusual household from the point of view of its most unloved occupants. Will the resilient roaches manage to withstand the new threat to their way of life? Tune in to find out!",
