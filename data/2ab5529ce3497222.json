    "text": "Hybrid anime featuring a blend of live-action and animation, depicts the unusual tale of a cockroach colony residing in a disheveled bachelor's apartment. The roaches, unafraid of traps, sprays, or human feet, live a carefree life, scavenging for food and engaging in games. The homeowner, a messy and unbothered individual, coexists peacefully with the roach colony, allowing them to thrive undisturbed. However, when a new woman enters the homeowner's life, the once easy-going existence of the roaches is threatened, leading to unexpected changes in their world.",
