    "text": "In the heart of the Abyss, Riko's journey to unravel the enigma of her mother's vanishing intensifies as she uncovers startling truths about her own lineage. With an unyielding resolve, Riko and her companion Reg bid farewell to Ozen's Seeker Camp, plunging into the perilous depths of the Third Layer and beyond. This film compendium encapsulates the latter half of the 2017 anime series, featuring their descent into the third layer where Riko grapples with the Curse for the first time. Their adventure escalates in the fourth layer when an Orbed Piercer wounds Riko's arm, leading to a daring rescue attempt by Reg. Aiding them in their time of need is Nanachi, who saves Riko's poisoned arm and requests Reg to end the life of her immortal friend, Mitty. Post this ordeal, Nanachi joins Riko and Reg in their audacious mission to conquer the Abyss's deepest point.",
