    "text": "Although a devastating war once pushed humanity to the brink, nations now engage in covert espionage to settle their disputes and avoid further bloodshed. In the Din Republic, an elite spy school trains future agents to serve their countries from the shadows. Despite her struggles with practical skills, Lily, a dedicated student, dreams of becoming a spy. When the legendary spy Klaus takes over the school after his mentor's death, he assembles a team of unlikely candidates—all with no real-world experience—to embark on an 'Impossible Mission' with a staggering 90% failure rate.\n\nAmong these misfits is Lily, who, despite her academic prowess, faces challenges in applying her knowledge in the field. As she joins the enigmatic group known as Lamplight, she discovers that her fellow teammates are also grappling with their own shortcomings. With just one month to prepare, they must infiltrate the hostile Galgad Empire under Klaus's guidance. Determined to prove themselves, the group of washouts bands together, employing every trick they can muster to defy the odds and succeed in their high-stakes mission.",
