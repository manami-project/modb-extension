    "text": "Polestar Empire reigns supreme over a war-torn Earth, following a united front against the destructive alien Eraser fleet during the turbulent Aquarian Age. Once rivals, the magical factions Arayashiki, Wiz-Dom, Darklore, and E.G.O. banded together to vanquish the extraterrestrial threat. However, the Empire's use of forbidden magic shatters the fragile peace, causing dimensional rifts to wreak havoc worldwide. As Earth spirals into chaos and warfare, four chosen warriors from each faction rise to protect humanity and restore balance to their beleaguered planet. With resurrected dead warriors and sinister forces looming, the fate of Earth hangs in the balance as the heroes face their most daunting challenge yet.",
