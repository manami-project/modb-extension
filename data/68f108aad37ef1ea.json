  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gosha Sei and the Holy Emperor Souther take center stage in this comedic spinoff of the classic Fist of the North Star series. Set in modern-day Japan, the legendary warriors of the original series have traded in their battle-hardened lives for more mundane existences. Kenshiro works at a convenience store, Raoh toils away in a factory, and an ailing Toki searches for employment. The Fighting NEET North Star legend begins anew in this peaceful era.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the Holy Emperor Souther attempts to befriend Kenshiro through various antics and party tricks. This lighthearted version of Souther showcases his comical side as he inserts himself into iconic moments from the original series and even plays with the Gosha Sei. With recurring gags, such as the turban-wearing kid repeatedly stabbing Souther in the leg, this parody offers a fresh and humorous take on the Fist of the North Star universe. Join Souther on his quest for friendship and laughter in this delightful adaptation of Hokuto no Ken: Ichigo Aji manga.",
