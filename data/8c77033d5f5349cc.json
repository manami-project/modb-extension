  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Since the late 1980s, a spirited nine-year-old girl named Rin has been living by herself on the picturesque Enoshima Island. With her parents no longer around, she faces the daunting task of managing both school and their family restaurant, which happens to be on the first floor of their home. Despite her tender age, Rin remains undeterred by the constant financial struggles and the poor quality of food she serves.\n\nDressed in her patched-up t-shirt, she cannot afford the luxury of a winter coat or even an umbrella. Yet, her infectious enthusiasm and unwavering determination attract the support of those around her, all rooting for her success. This heartwarming 4-koma web manga, available through the Tate Anime smartphone app, invites you to witness the everyday trials and triumphs of this extraordinary young girl.",
