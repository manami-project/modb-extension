  "synopsis": {
    "text": "That is the tale of Palme, a robot meticulously crafted from the enigmatic wood of a kooloop tree, a material believed to absorb the memories of civilizations it interacts with. Initially created to aid Xian, the ailing wife of his master, Palme's world crumbles when she passes away, leaving him bereft of purpose and in a state of inactivity.\n\nHowever, a fateful encounter with Koram, a wounded female warrior, rekindles his zest for life. Mistaking Koram for his late mistress, Palme is entrusted with a vital mission: to transport the enigmatic Egg of Touto to the mystical realm of Tamas, nestled deep within the planet.\n\nAs Palme embarks on this transformative journey, he crosses paths with Popo, a young girl who captures his heart. With renewed determination and a burgeoning understanding of the significance of the artifact he carries, Palme vows to complete his mission, hoping to exchange the artifact with the Tree of Life for his humanity.\n\nYet, the Tree and other sinister forces harbor darker intentions for the artifact. Convinced that the completion of Palme's mission would spell doom for the world, the inhabitants of Tamas are hell-bent on halting his progress. As Palme navigates through these challenges, he edges closer to understanding his own emotions and the essence of humanity.",
