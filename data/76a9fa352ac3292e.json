  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Together, the self-absorbed Hagito and the masochistic Kei form the eccentric duo, Narudoma, in this unconventional, surreal gag comedy. Hagito, a handsome yet pitiful man with a penchant for younger girls, is never seen without his trusty mirror. This oddball pair is surrounded by a motley crew of quirky characters, including the hardcore masochist Kei, the deceptively strong and feminine Totono, the fashion-forward workaholic Saitou, and the perpetually negative Roku. Even the seemingly ordinary character has his own peculiar quirks, adding to the chaos and hilarity of the show.",
