  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a plane crash strands four high school girls - Mutsu, Shion, Homare, and Asuka - on a deserted island, they must quickly learn how to survive with no modern amenities. Homare, who has past survival training with her father, takes the lead in showing the other frightened and unprepared girls how to build traps, test for allergies, and identify edible plants and insects on the island. We follow these courageous schoolgirls as they bond through the shared trauma of their circumstances, all while gaining profound wisdom and life skills that allow them to thrive in their harsh new environment. Though initially devastated to be marooned on a remote island, the girls come to appreciate the simple beauty of nature and the power of friendship. Their story proves that even in the bleakest conditions, the human spirit can prevail.",
