    "text": "When a group of young children engage in a rhythmic dance under the watchful eye of their teacher, an unexpected interruption occurs as a curious girl decides to meddle with their synchronized performance. This short film, directed by Atsushi Wada, showcases the dynamic between the determined teacher, the struggling young boy, and the intrigued girl. As the teacher's patience wears thin, the boy is relegated to the sidelines, leaving him to observe the dance he once participated in. However, when a bird catches his eye, the boy seizes the opportunity to follow it, with the mysterious girl trailing close behind.",
