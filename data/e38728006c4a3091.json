  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A group of children, led by their teacher, practice a ceremonial dance routine together. Their rehearsal is observed in secret by a young girl. As the teacher works to perfect the children's dance technique, one boy struggles to keep up. The teacher loses patience with the boy's mistakes and banishes him from the group to merely watch. At that moment, a bird catches the boy's attention. He breaks away from the group to follow the bird, with the observing girl trailing curiously behind him. Their impromptu adventure interrupts the carefully orchestrated dance, much to the teacher's frustration. Yet the allure of the unknown draws the children onward. This poetic short film explores themes of childhood innocence, imagination, and subtle rebellion against societal expectations. Through expressive movement and rich visual metaphor, director Atsushi Wada creates a window into the interior lives of children. Will innocence prevail, or will the teacher regain control?",
