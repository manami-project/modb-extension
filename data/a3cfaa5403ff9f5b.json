  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ten years ago, a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Hell's Gate\" emerged in Tokyo, surrounding part of the city with an impenetrable wall. At the same time, humans with supernatural abilities called \"Contractors\" began to appear. Devoid of emotion, Contractors possess unique powers that they use to carry out assassinations and other illegal activities. The police struggle to control the Contractors, especially the notorious BK201, known as the Black Reaper. His identity hidden behind a mask, BK201 possesses abilities that allow him to defeat rival Contractors. As part of an international research group called PANDORA that studies Hell's Gate, Li Shengshun goes undercover as a Chinese exchange student to investigate BK201. In reality, Li works for an unnamed organization with its own hidden agenda regarding Hell's Gate and the Contractors. With the police, PANDORA researchers, Contractors, and shadowy groups like Li's all vying for control, the mysteries surrounding Hell's Gate promise to have dramatic consequences for the people of Tokyo.",
