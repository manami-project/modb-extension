  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Di Gi Charat, princess of the planet Di Gi Charat, travels to Earth along with her friend Petit Charat (Puchiko) and guardian Gema, dreaming of becoming a pop idol superstar. Lacking money or a place to stay, they stumble upon an anime shop named Gamers and strike a deal with the manager to work there in exchange for room and board upstairs. At Gamers, the naive and selfish Di Gi Charat contends with her self-proclaimed rival Rabi~en~Rose as they compete for customer attention and affection in their quest for fame. Their coworkers include a mysterious, perpetually frowning bear mascot and an assortment of eccentric otaku customers and passersby. Di Gi Charat repeatedly hatches crazy schemes to draw attention to herself and achieve celebrity, though her plans usually backfire in humorous and surreal ways. Whether it's accidentally attacking pedestrians with her \"Laser Eye Beam\" or drawing the ire of Godzilla during its attack on the city, Di Gi Charat's misadventures at least succeed in making life at Gamers more lively and unpredictable. Ultimately, Di Gi Charat is a lighthearted comedy about an ambitious alien cat girl who learns to adjust to everyday life on Earth alongside her loyal friends, wacky coworkers, and a healthy dose of randomness.",
