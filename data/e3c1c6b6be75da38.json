With a penchant for solitude and a love for light novels, Haruka is far from thrilled about this unforeseen adventure. To make matters worse, the distribution of magical abilities is on a first-come, first-served basis, leaving him with an assortment of lackluster skills his classmates deemed unworthy. Armed with abilities like \"Walking\" and saddled with titles such as \"Blockhead\" and \"NEET,\" Haruka attempts to evade his overpowered classmates, hoping to maintain his solitary lifestyle in this strange new world. But will fate have other plans? Join Haruka as he navigates this unpredictable journey, filled with odd skills and unexpected encounters.",
