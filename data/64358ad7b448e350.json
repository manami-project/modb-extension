  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Every few years, the popular social game, 'The Magical Girl Raising Project,' grants a select few players the opportunity to become real-life magical girls, complete with extraordinary powers and extraordinary luck. However, when the number of magical girls becomes unsustainable, a ruthless competition is announced, forcing these sixteen young girls to fight for survival in a battle that only half can win.\n\nIn exciting news for fans of the franchise, an anime adaptation of Asari Endou's 'Magical Girl Raising Project Restart' light novel volumes has been given the green light. Hiroyuki Hashimoto, director of the first 'Magical Girl Raising Project' anime, will be returning for the new series, with the franchise's Twitter account hinting at various upcoming initiatives for 'Project Restart.'\n\nThe deadly game returns in this new adaptation, as sixteen magical girls are once again brought together for a high-stakes challenge. Every three days, they are pulled into an RPG-like simulation, where they must collaborate to defeat enemies, solve puzzles, and earn Magical Candy to progress. The allure of a ten billion yen reward at the end is too great to resist, but as competition intensifies, alliances will be tested, and the girls will be forced to turn on each other. With their lives on the line, a game over could mean so much more than just the end of the game...",
