  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As soon as Kaname Sudou, a typical high school student, accepts an invitation to play the unfamiliar mobile game \"Darwin's Game,\" his life takes a dramatic turn. Upon opening the app, a snake emerges from his screen and bites him, causing him to pass out. Baffled but unscathed, Kaname dismisses the incident as a hallucination. However, his curiosity reignites during his train ride home, leading him to open the app again. Initially, the game appears ordinary, but his first opponent suddenly materializes before him, knife in hand, turning his world into a ruthless battle for survival. As Kaname fights for his life, he realizes that \"Darwin's Game\" is far from an ordinary game, but a vicious contest where players wield supernatural abilities called Sigils. With no option to quit, Kaname must navigate this treacherous game, battling formidable opponents in a fight for survival.",
