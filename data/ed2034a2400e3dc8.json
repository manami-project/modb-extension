    "text": "Choice is the name of the game in this delightful animated short, where the fate of our reptilian hero, Raoul, rests in the hands of young decision-makers. Raoul, an alligator with a less-than-stellar tooth and an unruly mop of hair, faces the dilemma of choosing between a dentist or a barber. Meanwhile, his armored pal, Madillo the armadillo, ponders the necessity of an umbrella. The story unfolds through a series of events requiring judgments, spontaneity, and decisiveness from the 'Junior Directors'. This unique collaboration between elementary school students from Tokyo and Chicago brings an engaging and heartwarming tale to life, as the children's ideas shape the story through a series of workshops. Prepare to be charmed as you embark on this decision-making journey with Raoul and his friends!",
