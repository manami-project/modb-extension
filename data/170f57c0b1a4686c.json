  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Morishita Koyomi's high school experience is far from ordinary. Standing at a petite height, she is often mistaken for a grade schooler, making her a target for relentless teasing from her peers. Her clumsiness only adds fuel to the fire. However, her troubles pale in comparison to those of Yumiko, who is pursued by a malevolent magician. When their paths intertwine, Koyomi finds herself in a world of magic and danger.\n\nJust as technology evolves, so does magic in this world, transforming spells into sequences of binary code. Enter Anehara Misa, a master mage and graduate student, who takes Koyomi under her wing, teaching her the new-age style of magic. However, Koyomi's magical prowess seems to be limited to summoning washbasins from the sky, making her lessons a challenging endeavor.\n\nAs Koyomi navigates through her magical journey, she must confront malevolent creatures known as 'daemons' summoned by unscrupulous magic users. With Misa's guidance, Koyomi embarks on a desperate quest to improve her magical versatility, proving that magic is not always as easy as it seems. A unique blend of charm school and crash course awaits, filled with unpredictable challenges and enchanting lessons.",
