  "synopsis": {
    "text": "For centuries, the Takamimi Shrine in Tokyo has been home to an immortal elf named Elda, who was summoned from another realm during the Edo period. Fast forward to the present day, 16-year-old Koito Koganei finds herself in charge of the shrine and its peculiar resident. Elda, far from being a divine entity, is a video game-loving, snack-munching, recluse who prefers the comfort of her digital world over human interaction. As Koito navigates her daily life between school and shrine duties, she strives to coax Elda out of her shell, introducing her to the wonders of the outside world. Along the way, Koito discovers the unique bond between Elda and the local community, learning more about the history of the area and the quirks of her otaku elf companion. Prepare for a delightful blend of fantasy and comedy in this tale of an unlikely friendship!",
