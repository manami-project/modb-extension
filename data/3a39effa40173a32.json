    "text": "Smile Down the Runway is an anime that follows Chiyuki, a young fashion enthusiast who discusses style with her friends. In the first episode, she talks about Kim Jae-Joong, a member of the popular Korean group JYJ. His solo song \"Ray of Light\" is used as the ending theme song for the anime. The show also features short, humorous episodes with simplified \"chibi\" versions of the characters. These are posted on the official Twitter account for the anime, where Chiyuki continues sharing her passion for fashion icons and anime style. With a focus on the fashion world, engaging characters, and lighthearted comedy, Smile Down the Runway aims to entertain viewers with an inside look at the industry. Chiyuki's fashion critiques and the anime's nods to real-life pop culture style provide a fresh take on the slice-of-life genre.",
