    "text": "It's 2267, and humanity has left Earth behind, establishing a new home on the moon in a city called Eden. After a catastrophic event wiped out Earth's population and destroyed the planet's environment, the lunar city of Eden became the last bastion of civilization. Takeru, a young man with a passion for high-speed hovercraft racing, is about to embark on a journey that will challenge everything he knows about his world.\n\nWhen Takeru stumbles upon a mysterious photograph of a girl standing under a blue sky, he begins to question the truth about Earth's demise and Eden's origins. As he digs deeper, he discovers that the ruling Foundation has been perpetuating a lie to keep its citizens in the dark. With the help of his friends, Takeru sets out on a dangerous mission to uncover the truth about Earth and the secrets hidden by the Foundation.\n\nAs Takeru delves deeper into the mystery, he realizes that the Foundation will stop at nothing to keep their secrets safe. But Takeru is determined to expose the truth, no matter the cost. In a world where everything he knows is a lie, Takeru's quest for the truth will change the course of history and the future of humanity.
