  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One bookstore clerk, Kosuke Mikado, has an uncanny ability to see spirits and ghosts, a gift that brings him more terror than joy. When he crosses paths with Rihito Hiyakawa, an exorcist with formidable supernatural powers and lacking social skills, Mikado is unwillingly pulled into a world of paranormal investigations. As they work together to solve bizarre cases, their unconventional methods may not be suitable for all audiences. Mikado, despite his initial fear, finds an odd sense of satisfaction in exorcising spirits with Hiyakawa. Amidst their daily encounters with the supernatural, they stumble upon a chilling murder case that seems to be connected to a mysterious figure named 'Erika Hiura'. As they delve deeper into this mystery, Hiyakawa's hidden secrets threaten to disrupt their budding relationship. Join this unlikely duo as they navigate the eerie world of the paranormal, where danger lurks at every corner.",
