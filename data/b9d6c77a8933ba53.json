    "text": "The narrative of the anime follows three monstrous entities, Bem, Bera, and Berro, who, despite their intimidating appearances, are champions of justice. Bem bears a striking resemblance to a gangster, Bera takes on the form of a witch, and Berro appears as a young boy. Their mission is to shield humans from the malevolent actions of other monsters and youkai, hoping that their noble deeds will one day transform them into humans.\n\nSet in a sprawling coastal metropolis plagued by an ominous ambiance caused by human immorality and monster mischief, the trio resolves to stay and combat these evil forces. Despite facing abuse and alienation from humans due to their frightening looks, and being shunned by fellow youkai, they remain steadfast in their mission to safeguard the city's human inhabitants.\n\nThroughout their journey, they form a few friendships and often find themselves protecting a particular young boy. The anime boasts a distinctive animation style and engaging storylines, offering viewers a unique blend of action, drama, and supernatural elements.",
