Plagued by dreams of dragons and superpowered warriors, Soya's only memory of his past is a vivid nightmare of destruction. When his city is attacked by a massive, teddy bear-shaped UFO, seven rainbow-sparkling heroes emerge to defend it. However, Soya's life takes an unexpected turn as he is thrust into a conflict against these protectors, with his true motive for fighting hidden deep within his lost memories.
