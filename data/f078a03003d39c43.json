    "text": "God's lost message to mankind, given alongside the Ten Commandments, has eluded humanity for centuries. Enter Koichiro Kamishiro, a contemporary archaeologist with a penchant for uncovering ancient ruins and a knack for inadvertent destruction. When Kamishiro stumbles upon a mysterious box containing two crystal triangles, he unwittingly becomes the keeper of the key to God's forgotten message.\n\nNow, Kamishiro finds himself in the crosshairs of various factions, including the KGB and CIA, all vying for control over the divine revelation and, by extension, the fate of the world. As he navigates assassination attempts and the affections of several women, Kamishiro must also contend with extraterrestrial beings bent on Earth's annihilation. With the weight of the world resting on his shoulders, Kamishiro's quest for divine wisdom becomes a thrilling race against time, filled with danger, intrigue, and unexpected romance.",
