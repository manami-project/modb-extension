However, when the ritual goes awry, the unsuspecting students find themselves trapped in the decaying, spectral remains of Tenjin Elementary School, a building that was demolished years ago.\n\nTo escape the clutches of this haunted school, the students must work together to solve its mysteries and correct the botched ritual.
