    "text": "Man ifested with a voice and personality, the sentient tank, Gyrano De Borgerac, indulges in the lavish attention of maids, while the fairy Sherri basks in the opulence of court life. Princess Rita prepares to fulfill her royal obligations, but Tina's resolve remains unshaken. Haunted by the memory of her family's brutal demise at the hands of the enigmatic figure bearing the Bee the Death tattoo, Tina embarks on a quest for vengeance. The impending farewell between Tina and Rita casts a somber shadow over their hearts, as they reminisce about their shared experiences.\n\nAs Tina departs, she traverses the raw wounds left by the Great War that ravaged cities a decade ago. Her journey uncovers a hidden truth about her sworn enemy, a revelation that will challenge everything she knows. With a fragile peace treaty in place, Tina and Rita venture forth, unaware that the echoes of war still linger, hinting at a far more complex reality.",
