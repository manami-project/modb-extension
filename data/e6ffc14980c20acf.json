    "text": "What if the beings you created surpassed your own understanding? In 2105 Japan, human-like androids known as hIEs have become an integral part of society, performing tasks that humans cannot or will not do. While most people view these advanced machines as mere objects, 17-year-old Arato Endou sees them differently. Unlike his friends, Arato feels a connection with these androids, even though they are believed to lack souls.\n\nOne fateful night, Arato's life takes a drastic turn when he is attacked by a mysterious force that sends technology into chaos. Just as all hope seems lost, an advanced hIE named Lacia appears, offering to save him. But there's a catch: Arato must become her owner and take responsibility for her actions. Desperate and intrigued, Arato agrees, unaware of the consequences that lie ahead.\n\nAs one of five highly advanced androids with their own motivations, Lacia's presence in Arato's life raises questions about the future relationship between humans and machines. Will they coexist peacefully, or will the battle for supremacy lead to destruction? Only time will tell as Arato navigates this new world, questioning the true nature of these artificial beings and the meaning of a soul.",
