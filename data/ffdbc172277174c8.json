    "text": "Kazuki and his fellow classmates reside on the tranquil island of Tatsumiyajima, a seemingly uneventful place where the blue sky and sea stretch endlessly. However, their peaceful lives are disrupted when they start receiving an enigmatic message from an alien race: 'Are you there?'. Little do they know that their island is Earth's last defense against these hostile invaders who threaten not only their physical existence but also their very identities.\n\nThese young individuals are unexpectedly thrust into a battle for humanity's survival, piloting colossal robots known as Fafnirs - a secret their peaceful village has been harboring. Born with unique genetic qualifications, they are the only ones capable of controlling these powerful machines. As the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, these brave youths must confront an enemy that pushes them to the brink of mental assimilation.\n\nIn a world where a simple reply to a mysterious message can trigger a catastrophic invasion, Kazuki and his friends must find the strength and courage to protect their home. But as they stand as Earth's final line of defense, who will shield them from the brink of annihilation?",
