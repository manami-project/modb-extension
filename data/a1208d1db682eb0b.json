    "text": "In the city of Mitakihara, middle school girls Madoka Kaname and Sayaka Miki have normal lives until they encounter Kyubey, an incubator who offers to grant them any wish in exchange for becoming magical girls. However, Kyubey hides the dark truth that magical girls are doomed to eventually fall into despair and become witches. Sayaka makes a selfless wish but struggles with the ensuing isolation and moral dilemmas of being a magical girl, slowly succumbing to despair. Determined to save her friend, Kyoko Sakura forms an alliance with Homura Akemi, a time-traveling magical girl fixated on preventing Madoka from sharing the same tragic fate. Despite their efforts, Sayaka transforms into a witch. Heartbroken, Kyoko sacrifices herself in battle to put Sayaka out of her misery. With the powerful Walpurgisnacht witch fast approaching, Homura desperately continues her mission to save Madoka. However, Homura ultimately fails and Madoka decides to make a game-changing wish to erase witches before they are born. By selflessly sacrificing her humanity, Madoka rewrites the cruel destiny facing all magical girls.",
