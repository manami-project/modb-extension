  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kuni, a world inhabited by immortal, genderless beings known as Gems. In this distant future, these crystalline organisms must defend themselves against the relentless attacks of the Moon Dwellers, who seek to shatter their bodies and use them as decorations. Each Gem is assigned a specific role to aid in the battle for survival, but Phosphophyllite, the youngest and most fragile of them all, is deemed unfit for combat. Instead, they are tasked with creating a natural history encyclopedia by their master, Adamantine. As Phos embarks on this intellectual journey, they encounter Cinnabar, a fellow outcast Gem struggling with their own role. Together, they strive to find their place in this war-torn world and protect their fellow Gems from the ever-looming threat of the Moon Dwellers.",
