  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mankai Company was once a famous all-male theater troupe, but has since fallen on hard times. When Izumi Tachibana takes over as the new director, she finds the company deep in debt with only one remaining member. Determined to restore Mankai to its former glory, Izumi confronts the yakuza loan sharks and boldly promises to pay off the debt. She manages to recruit enough eccentric new talent for an Autumn Troupe, including a boastful jack-of-all-trades, a stoic delinquent passionate about acting, a man wanting to impress girls on stage, a photography enthusiast, and even a yakuza member connected to Mankai's past. However, with non-existent teamwork and multiple threats jeopardizing their debut performance, uniting this chaotic troupe proves more difficult than Izumi anticipated. Through dedicated leadership and belief in her actors, she must find a way to bloom their talents in time for their show. Having already successfully launched a Spring and Summer Troupe, the fate of Mankai rides on the Autumn Troupeâ€™s success...as does impressing the watchful yakuza debt collector waiting in the wings.",
