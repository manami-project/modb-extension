    "text": "A young woman receives unexpected news from her doctor that she is pregnant. Thrown into a state of distress, she grapples with the revelation as she oscillates between fantasies and nightmares. Her fleeting dreams and visions reflect her inner turmoil and despair.\n\nThis anime short depicts the emotional journey of a woman coping with an unplanned pregnancy. Created as a student project while attending the Tokyo University of the Arts, the animation aims to portray the complex psychological state of its protagonist. Through creative visuals and atmosphere, the film explores difficult themes of anxiety, vulnerability, and the blurring of reality in times of crisis.  \n\nHaunting and evocative, this ethereal glimpse into one woman's personal struggle suggests that even the most disquieting of dreams may contain a seed of hope within their despair.",
