  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A group of dangerous space pirates have come to Earth with the goal of planting the Tree of Might, an invasive plant that threatens to drain the planet of all its energy. Led by the ruthless Saiyan warrior Turles, these pirates successfully plant the seed and the massive tree begins taking root, destroying forests and cities in the process. Alarmed by the emerging threat, Goku and his allies attempt to take down Turles and his crew. However, after consuming fruit from the Tree of Might, Turles experiences a surge in power. He easily overpowers Goku and the others, leaving Earth's last hope severely beaten. With the tree continuing to spread across Earth, absorbing more energy by the second, Goku faces a race against time to become strong enough to confront Turles again. Knowing the stakes of failure, he digs deep within himself to somehow find the power needed to defeat these space invaders and save his son Gohan, along with the entire planet, from imminent doom. The fate of Earth hangs in the balance of this climactic showdown.",
