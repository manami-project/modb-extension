    "text": "Makenko was once an ordinary boy until the fateful day he was kidnapped by the nefarious Dr. Mud. This brilliant but twisted scientist transformed Makenko into a powerful cyborg capable of battling monsters that threaten both the human and spirit worlds. Seeking vengeance, Makenko finds unlikely allies in Makendo, a seasoned yet reluctant monster hunter, and her cheerful little sister Hikari. Though mismatched, the trio set off on an epic adventure to reverse Makenko's unwanted transformation by defeating Dr. Mud and his army of demons and monsters. They face many dangers, but also forge strong bonds of friendship. With high stakes, wacky monsters, and plenty of butt-kicking action, Makenko and his new friends grow in skill and character while striving to reclaim his original body. Can this motley crew take down the nefarious Dr. Mud once and for all?",
