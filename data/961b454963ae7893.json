  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over the tranquil island of Windaria, a wave of change is set in motion when a mysterious girl, Kaguya, finds herself washed ashore following a tempestuous storm. With no recollection of her past and devoid of emotions, Kaguya crosses paths with Rick, a swordsman-turned-baker who can empathize with her predicament, having once been in a similar situation.\n\nAs Kaguya gradually acclimates to the island and delights in the scrumptious pastries prepared by Rick and his coworkers—Nellis, Amyl, and Aerie—a sinister force looms. Pirates swarm the island, their sights set on the enigmatic spirit stone adorning Kaguya's neck. With the once peaceful Windaria thrown into chaos, Rick and his colleagues resolve to protect Kaguya, restore tranquility to the island, and help her reclaim her lost memories and emotions.\n\nIn this captivating tale, diverse races such as elves and beast-people coexist, and the line between friend and foe blurs as the red moon ascends and an ominous wind portends the unfolding of a series of extraordinary events.",
