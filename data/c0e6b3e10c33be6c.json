  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During the brutal Hundred Years' War between England and France, a young witch named Maria lives peacefully in a secret forest with her two familiars - a mischievous succubus and incubus. Though she stays removed from the violence ravaging the land, Maria's compassionate heart aches for the innocent lives lost in the endless conflict. Driven by a longing to end the senseless bloodshed, she begins using her powerful magic to discreetly intervene in the war, hoping to tilt the tides toward peace. However, Maria's well-intentioned meddling soon attracts the ire of the heavens. The Archangel Michael confronts Maria, condemning her interventions as defiance of the divine order. As punishment for her perceived heresy, Michael decrees that Maria will lose her magic if she ever surrenders her virginity. Though now labeled as an enemy of heaven, the headstrong Maria refuses to abandon her mission for peace. But with both the church and angels conspiring to restrain the virgin witchâ€™s defiant spirit, Maria faces threats from all sides. To achieve her goal of ending the war and protecting her magic, she must rely on her wits and the help of her sly supernatural friends to outmaneuver her enemies.",
