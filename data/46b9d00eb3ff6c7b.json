    "text": "Concert Band of Kitauji High School, after securing a victory at the Kyoto Concert Band Competition, is now gearing up for the prestigious Kansai competition. The band members, including Kumiko Oumae and her friends, are determined to clinch the gold medal. To hone their skills, they attend a rigorous summer camp led by their band advisor, Noboru Taki, and his professional musician friends. However, the harmony within the band is disrupted when a former member expresses interest in rejoining, stirring up painful memories for the second-year members. Meanwhile, Kumiko discovers her teacher's hidden past and the driving force behind his ambition to lead the band to triumph.\n\nAs the national tournament looms closer, the band intensifies their practice sessions, leaving little room for leisure activities. The demanding schedule strengthens Kumiko's bond with Reina, but elsewhere, the band's unity is threatened by brewing drama. The lingering specter of the previous year's mass departure still haunts many band members, and the situation becomes more complicated when former member Nozomi Kasaki seeks to rejoin the band. As the past grudges resurface, maintaining unity within the band becomes a challenging task. (Source: Anime News Network, edited)",
