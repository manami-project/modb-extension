    "text": "In 1860s Kyoto, a war rages in the shadows between the Shinsengumi, the armed force serving the Shogunate, and vampire-like warriors called the Rasetsu. Young Chizuru Yukimura arrives in the city disguised as a man, searching for her missing father Koudou, a doctor. After witnessing a fight between an Oni and the Shinsengumi, Chizuru is taken into Shinsengumi custody. They soon realize Chizuru's father is the same man they seek. The Shinsengumi take Chizuru with them on their continued search for her father, suspecting he created a secret elixir enhancing physical abilities. This elixir is coveted by the ruthless Rasetsu, who will stop at nothing to control its power. As Chizuru aids the Shinsengumi's vice commander Toshizo Hijikata, she becomes embroiled in the conflict, her fate intertwining with theirs. This high-stakes struggle in 1860s Kyoto threatens to alter the course of history. Brave samurai, vampire-like warriors, a missing doctor, and his devoted daughter search for answers while confronting deadly danger at every shadowy turn.",
