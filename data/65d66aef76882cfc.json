    "text": "Shogunate's armed enforcers, the Shinsengumi, and the vampire-like Ronin warriors known as the Rasetsu or Furies. Caught in the crossfire is Chizuru Yukimura, a young woman masquerading as a man, who arrives in Kyoto in search of her missing father, a doctor who has developed a secret elixir that enhances the user's strength, speed, and healing. As Chizuru's path intertwines with the Shinsengumi, she is taken into their custody and joins their quest to find her father. Little does she know, the furies will stop at nothing to obtain the power of the elixir, and Chizuru's fate is forever entwined with the Shinsengumi and their vice commander, Toshizo Hijikata. As Chizuru navigates the dangerous streets of Kyoto, she uncovers the dark secrets of the city and the true nature of the Rasetsu. Will she find her father and escape the clutches of the furies, or will she become another casualty in the war for power?",
