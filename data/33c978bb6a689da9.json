  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Serpent demons, monks, and a mysterious spirit doctor traverse the mystical lands of ancient China, providing aid to both humans and supernatural beings plagued by illnesses and afflictions. The spirit doctor, Taozi, is an enigmatic young girl with a complex personality that blends angelic and demonic traits. Her skills in spiritual healing are unparalleled, but her demanding fees and unpredictable nature leave her both revered and feared by the spirit realm.\n\nJoined by her loyal assistant, Moya, a young monk with stunted development whose life she saved, and Gungun the Grey Fox, a cunning prince of the Serpent Devil who has taken over a man's body, Taozi embarks on a journey to treat ailments that affect ghosts, monsters, and even animals in desperate need. Along the way, they encounter various yaoguai - sentient spirits, demons, animals, and forces of nature - and unravel the intricate stories behind their suffering.\n\nAs this unlikely trio delves deeper into the spirit world, they witness the joy and sorrow experienced by those they meet, leaving a lasting impact on the lives they touch. With Taozi's silent bell and her extraordinary abilities, they seek to bring balance and healing to a world filled with mystical creatures and extraordinary challenges.",
