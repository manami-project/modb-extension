  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the heart of Hokkaido, a young girl known as Exorcist stands as the region's sole protector against an unusual threat - a horde of zombies. Her mission, though challenging, is manageable until the formidable Shinsengumi, led by Hijikata Toshizou, rise from their eternal slumber, posing a significant threat. Amidst this turmoil, Exorcist finds an unlikely ally in Francesca, an undead idol with a quirky personality and a knack for disassembling and incorrectly reassembling her body parts. Along with Francesca's dog, Franken, this odd trio works together to safeguard Hokkaido from the impending zombie storm. However, the partnership is not without its complications. Exorcist, often finding herself at odds with Francesca's clumsy antics and Franken's unfriendly demeanor, struggles to maintain order while battling the undead. Despite the chaos, Exorcist remains determined, viewing Francesca not just as an ally, but also as a rival in this high-stakes battle for their homeland.",
