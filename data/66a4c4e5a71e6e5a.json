    "text": "Held in a grand arena filled with a variety of attractions, from haunted houses to food stands, Hyoutei Gakuen's eccentric and incredibly wealthy tennis captain, Atobe Keigo, hosts a special event for the day - the first-ever tennis carnival. The carnival brings together friends and rivals from all of the regional Junior High tennis teams, including St. Rudolph and Rikkaidai. The main event of the day is an obstacle competition between the schools, with a set of high-class tennis equipment and their pride on the line. However, the carnival is not just about the competition, as Atobe has organized various sports and events, such as dancing, swimming, soccer, and a relay race, for everyone to participate in. As the day progresses, it becomes clear that Atobe has a hidden motive for organizing this lavish event. Who will emerge victorious in the obstacle competition, and what is Atobe's true intention for hosting this day of festivities?",
