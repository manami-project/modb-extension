  "synopsis": {
    "text": "All Shuichi has ever wanted is to become a successful singer, just like his idol Ryuichi Sakuma. Together with his best friend Hiro, he's formed a band called Bad Luck and they've even been signed by a major recording label. But with looming deadlines and no lyrics for their songs, Shuichi is in desperate need of inspiration. When his latest lyrics fly away in the park and land at the feet of a mysterious stranger, Shuichi thinks he's found his muse. But the stranger turns out to be Eiri Yuki, a famous novelist who dismisses Shuichi's lyrics as talentless. Angered by Yuki's criticism, Shuichi finishes his song and seeks him out to confront him. But as he gets to know Yuki, he realizes that his feelings for the novelist may be more than just anger. Can Shuichi accept that he's fallen for the man who crushed his dreams? And will he be able to balance his newfound love with his ambition to become a successful singer?",
