    "text": "It's all hands on deck at Kaimei Academy with the self-proclaimed problem-solvers, the Sket Brigade! Comprised of the goggle-wearing leader, Yusuke \"Bossun\" Fujisaki, the feisty and hockey stick-swinging Himeko \"Onihime\" Onizuka, and the tech-savvy otaku Kazuyoshi \"Switch\" Usui, this trio is on a mission to make school life a breeze. From rescuing new students from bullies to repairing the gym shed, no task is too mundane or too daunting for this eclectic group. Although they often find themselves lounging in their clubroom, the Sket Brigade is always ready to jump into action and lend a helping hand when duty calls, providing their unique brand of support, encouragement, and troubleshooting to those who seek their assistance.",
