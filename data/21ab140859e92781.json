  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On a quest for treasure and adventure, the formidable all-female crew of the colossal starship Sol Bianca fearlessly navigates the cosmos, leaving a trail of chaos and destruction in their wake. Thousands of years into the future, humanity has expanded across the galaxy, abandoning Earth to the annals of history. Among the stars, the Sol Bianca's crew – comprised of April, Jun, Janny, Feb, and the mysterious young stowaway May – find themselves pitted against the might of an iron-fisted dictator, who holds a coveted treasure and a secret that could unlock the mysteries of a forgotten Earth.\n\nAs the ruthless space pirates embark on a relentless crusade for wealth and answers, they wield an arsenal of futuristic weaponry, including power armor and energy whips. Aided by their artificially intelligent ship capable of warping dimensions, the Sol Bianca, these battle-hardened women forge a path of liberation and annihilation, toppling cities and oppressive regimes alike. United in their pursuit of life, liberty, and lawlessness, the Sol Bianca's crew will stop at nothing to uncover the truth about May's parents, the lost planet Earth, and the priceless treasure that drives their insatiable greed.",
