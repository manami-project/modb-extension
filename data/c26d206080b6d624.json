  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hikari Tsutsui is a socially awkward high school otaku who immerses himself in anime, manga, and video games, avoiding real relationships. His only friend is Yuuto, a fellow otaku. When Hikari is forced to clean the school pool as punishment, he meets Iroha Igarashi, a popular girl known for her blunt, promiscuous behavior. Though initially wary of her, Iroha reaches out to Hikari and defends him from bullies. To his surprise, she seems genuinely interested in him. As they spend more time together, Hikari develops feelings for Iroha, and they begin a romantic relationship. Despite their differences, Hikari and Iroha form a strong bond, challenging one another's preconceptions. Iroha helps bring Hikari out of his shell, while Hikari sees beyond Iroha's party girl reputation. Their unlikely love story explores issues of social anxiety, bullying, friendship, and finding connection across social barriers.",
