    "text": "The second installment in a trilogy of OVAs featuring the goddess Neptune, this episode bundles a fun figure collectible. On the day of Planeptune's lively Cosplay Party, preparations have exhausted host Neptune. Then she learns interdimensional traveler Older Neptune, whom she met on a summer vacation, is arriving. While Neptune's sister Nepgear and friends leave to welcome back Older Neptune, overwhelmed Neptune passes out. Though aiming to relax at a mountain resort, the goddesses and CPU sisters face chaos when a portal abruptly opens, sweeping the little sisters to a parallel world. There they reunite with familiar allies, sparking hijinks across dimensions.",
