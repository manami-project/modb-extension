  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Three little fairies named Pikupiku, Shirushiru, and Korokoro happily live together in a magical forest. They spend their days sipping tea and engaging in lively debates about peculiar everyday mysteries like insomnia and rumor origins. When they grow bored of talking, the adventurous trio explores fantastical realms by using their weak magic powers. They particularly enjoy jumping into an enchanted lake that allows them to peer into bizarre parallel worlds vastly different from their own. However, their tiny forest home contains enough magic on its own to fuel endless fun adventures for the quirky fairies. Whether conducting wacky experiments, pulling pranks, or simply letting their imaginations run wild, Pikupiku, Shirushiru, and Korokoro find joy in all they do together. Their magical realm overflows with laughter and lighthearted absurdity each day.",
