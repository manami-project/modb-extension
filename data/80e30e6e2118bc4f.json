  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Turbo CD and NES enthusiasts rejoice as the beloved Role-Playing games, Otaku no Seiza: in Another World and Otaku no Seiza: An Adventure in the Otaku Galaxy, come to life in this thrilling anime adaptation. Published by M&M in the early 90s, these cult classics now find themselves reimagined in a world plagued by an enigmatic disease.\n\nEnter our hero, a man of unparalleled prowess who needs no introduction or name. He's a seasoned warrior, well-versed in the art of battle, navigating oceans, traversing space, and even strutting his stuff in nudist colony fashion shows. He's a man who can relate to the legendary Momotaro.\n\nAccompanied by his less-than-intelligent sidekick and a transgender ally, our hero must confront a sinister idol group responsible for transforming men into otaku. The mastermind behind this chaos is none other than the wicked demon Indra, who revels in the shadows.\n\nWith the fate of the universe hanging in the balance, our nameless hero embarks on a mission to overthrow the idols and thwart Indra's nefarious plans. Will he succeed in just two episodes, or will the gratuitous fanservice fillers prove too much to handle?\n\nUnfortunately, information on this show and availability of copies are scarce, making it a true gem for those fortunate enough to stumble upon it.",
