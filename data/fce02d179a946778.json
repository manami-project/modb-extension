However, Takeru must undergo intense training at the Maken-ki camp there to gain control of his Maken weapon and power. He is motivated by his desire to protect Haruko. Their beach vacation is disrupted by an emergency. Takeru's training is cut short as he and the group respond to this crisis. It seems there is more adventure in store for them this summer beyond just relaxing at the beach. The friends brought revealing swimwear to the island, likely expecting mostly fun times. But they end up dealing with unexpected trouble in the form an attack from a giant octopus. Additionally, Takeru has to contend with one girl's tendency to grope him in her sleep. Though their vacation takes some turbulent turns, Takeru focuses on progressing with his combat training while enjoying time with Haruko and friends.
