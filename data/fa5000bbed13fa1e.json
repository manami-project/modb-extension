    "text": "In 2032, the legendary idol group \"7th Sisters\" suddenly retired, leading to the demise of the idol industry. Two years later, a young employee is appointed leader of \"777 (Three Seven)\", also known as \"Nanastar\", a new generation idol studio in Tokyo trying to revive the industry. However, the public believes idols are outdated, and Nanastar struggles to gain traction. One day, a mysterious female manager approaches and says if past idols are gone, they must create new ones - true \"sisters\" bonded powerfully. She helps form the \"Nanastar Sisters\", a new idol group aiming to prove idols have a future. Later, during a Nanastar Sisters concert, equipment troubles threaten cancellation. Instead, the manager of \"HAKKAKU\", once a dominant entertainment studio, resolves the crisis. The sisters learn HAKKAKU faces potential closure from a corporate takeover, but financial support will continue if they fill seats at HAKKAKU's venue. Wanting to help the studio holding many memories, the Nanastar Sisters work to attract a full audience. In the end, the story follows an aspiring manager and idol group trying to restore the industry by forming bonds and connections with each other and veteran groups of the past.",
