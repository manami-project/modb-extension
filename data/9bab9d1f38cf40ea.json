  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a near-future Japan impacted by climate change, the city of Yokohama has been flooded, leaving only small communities living on the remaining hilltops. Alpha, an android, cheerfully runs a café in one of these communities. She treasures the peaceful days spent immersed in nature and the company of her friends. When a typhoon damages Alpha's café, her friend invites her to take shelter at his gas station. Returning after the storm, Alpha is devastated to find her beloved café in ruins. Determined to rebuild, she decides to embark on a journey across Japan to earn money for the repairs. She looks forward to exploring the country and expanding her understanding of the world beyond her small town. As Alpha travels, she discovers awe-inspiring landscapes and remnants of human civilization lost below the waves. Through chance encounters with both humans and robots, she gains new perspectives on life. However, with each new discovery, Alpha also comes to appreciate the comforts of home and community. In the end, Alpha returns to her friends, eager to rebuild the café that has given her so much joy. Though the journey has broadened her horizons, Alpha understands that she found something even more valuable along the way – a deeper appreciation for the people and places she already holds dear.",
