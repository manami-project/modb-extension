  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around the Mouri family obtaining a new, high-tech Wooo television. The first episode depicts the famous detective Kogoro Mouri trying to impress his family by correctly guessing the culprit in a mystery drama they are watching. However, it seems Kogoro's newfound deductive brilliance actually stems from an unexpected source related to the capabilities of the new Wooo TV. In the second episode, a famous idol named Maomi Yuuki visits the Mouri detective agency seeking help for her parents, who are having issues recording programs on their own television. Yuuki's celebrity status catches the attention of Kogoro's daughter, Ran, and the young Conan Edogawa. Together, Conan and the advanced features of the Mouri family's new Wooo TV are able to provide a clever solution to the Yuukis' dilemma. Though brief, these comedic episodes showcase some of the handy capabilities of the interactive and intuitive Wooo televisions. The anime also features the popular characters from the hit Detective Conan series, drawing in fans of the franchise. The collaboration between Conan and the Wooo seems mutually beneficial, providing entertaining self-contained stories while promoting the Wooo product line.",
