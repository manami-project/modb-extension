  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the realm of divine beings with an excess of leisure time, a complex and challenging game of intellect, known as 'The Play of the Gods,' has been devised to entertain the gods and engage humanity. A former goddess, Leche, awakens from a millennia-long slumber and sets out to find the greatest player of the current era. Enter Fay, a gifted rookie and representative of humankind, who is selected to face off against the gods in this ultimate battle of wits.\n\nNever before has a human achieved victory in this seemingly impossible contest, as the gods are known for their whimsical, unreasonable, and often unfathomable nature. However, the allure of the game is too enticing to resist, and with the spirit of enjoyment at its core, Fay and his friends embark on a thrilling journey to challenge the gods.\n\nJoined by the former goddess, this extraordinary group of individuals sets out to conquer the game and achieve what no human has before. As they navigate through the gods' absurd trials, they strive to make the most of this unique opportunity, embracing the challenge and relishing every moment of their intellectual adventure.",
