  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The supreme gods, bored with eternity, created the ultimate game to challenge humanity - 'Play of the Gods'. Leshea, a former goddess awakened from a long slumber, demanded to face the best human player. Fay, a rookie gamer, was nominated. Though no human has ever conquered the 10 mystical games against the capricious deities, Fay and Leshea partner up, sharing a passion for gaming. Together they take on the absurd, maddening contests, aiming to best the gods once and for all and win their heart's desires - Leshea to regain her lost divinity, and Fay to find his long lost mentor. It's an epic brain battle between humans and gods, but when facing restless omnipotence, sometimes the only thing left is to embrace the madness and play for the love of the games.",
