As the class president, Matsuno is tasked with showing Rikako around, but it's Taku who unwittingly becomes entangled in her complicated life.\n\nDuring a class trip, Rikako approaches Taku for a loan, revealing a vulnerable side that he can't resist. As he delves deeper into her world, their relationship strains Taku's long-standing friendship with Matsuno, who harbors feelings for Rikako. Caught between his loyalty to Matsuno and his growing affection for Rikako, Taku must navigate the turbulent waters of adolescence, love, and friendship.\n\nAs rumors swirl around the school and repayment delays create misunderstandings, Taku must confront his feelings and unravel the mysteries surrounding Rikako's troubled past.
