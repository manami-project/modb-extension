  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Moli, a 15-year-old high school student, finds herself in an unexpected predicament when a sudden storm and a bolt of lightning transport her from her mundane life to the enchanting Tea Continent. Upon awakening, she encounters Longjing, a charming boy with dog-like features, and discovers that she now possesses adorable cat ears. With no recollection of her past, Moli embarks on an exciting journey through this RPG-inspired world, eager to unravel her newfound destiny as its main character.\n\nJust as Moli was about to begin her high school life, a twist of fate sends her to the mystical Continent of Mingzu. Stunned by the realization that she's entered a chibi-style realm filled with half-beast inhabitants, Moli decides to embrace her new environment, albeit reluctantly. Determined to live a carefree life, she has no intention of taking on the heavy burden of becoming a powerful magician. Instead, she chooses to indulge in the sweet, simple pleasures this world has to offer.\n\nIn an unforeseen turn of events, the young girl Jasmine is whisked away to the extraordinary Land of Tea, a realm inhabited by orc-like humans. As she adapts to her new surroundings, Jasmine learns that she has become the legendary wizard of this world. Joined by a group of remarkable friends, she sets off on an incredible adventure that defies belief.",
