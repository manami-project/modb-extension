    "text": "And so, we find ourselves in a future far removed from our own, where the once-great United Planets has crumbled, and the mighty Empire has fallen. In this new era, humanity has spread out across the cosmos, seeking solace on distant planets, and enjoying the tranquility that eluded their ancestors.\n\nEnter Banjo Ueki Tylor, a humble garbage collector, floating above the serene atmosphere of one such planet. His life takes a dramatic turn when he stumbles upon a derelict robot ship, hidden within which is a mysterious girl, encased in ice. As the ice melts, the galaxy stirs, for this girl is none other than Goza the 168th, the prophesied bringer of the galaxy's doom.\n\nAs sinister forces close in on Goza, Banjo finds himself an unlikely protector, embarking on a grand adventure to restore the United Planets to its former glory. But as they navigate the treacherous cosmos, they discover that the path to redemption is fraught with unexpected challenges, and nothing is as it seems.\n\nJoin Banjo and Goza on their thrilling journey, where laughter, danger, and destiny collide, and where the fate of the galaxy rests in the hands of the most unlikely duo.",
