  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Second World War's brutal onslaught has left Japan in ruins, with countless cities leveled by relentless American bombings. In the midst of this chaos, two young siblings, Seita and his little sister Setsuko, find themselves orphaned and homeless when a devastating air raid claims their mother's life. Left to fend for themselves in the desolate Japanese countryside, they grapple with hunger, indifference from the adults around them, and the harsh realities of a world torn apart by war.\n\nDespite their dire circumstances, the siblings' unyielding spirit and love for one another provide a glimmer of hope in the face of overwhelming adversity. However, as food becomes increasingly scarce and Setsuko's health begins to deteriorate, Seita is forced to confront the heartbreaking fragility of their lives. Based on the critically acclaimed anime \"Grave of the Fireflies\" (Hotaru no Haka), this poignant tale serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of war and the incredible resilience of the human spirit.",
