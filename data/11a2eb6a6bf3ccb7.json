    "text": "Cluster Edge Academy is an elite school attended by the children of society's upper crust, who are being groomed as future leaders. Into this rarefied environment steps Agate Fluorite - an optimistic and cheerful transfer student with no apparent background. Yet Agate is shrouded in mystery - he possesses the inexplicable ability to work miracles and seems destined for something greater. Agate's refreshing presence captures the attention of his classmates, particularly the jaded Beryl Jasper. However, Agate arrives at a turbulent time. Artificial soldiers, a remnant of past wars, are rebelling against society under the banner of the deceased Cluster E.A. alumnus Chalce. Agate soon becomes embroiled in the ensuing chaos along with his newfound friends. As various factions wrestle for control of the future, the key to unlocking Agate's true origins and purpose begins to emerge. Yet the very world that created Cluster Edge Academy may not survive the revelations and upheaval to come. Against this backdrop of social unrest and self-discovery, an unlikely group of students and soldiers will determine the fate of their country.",
