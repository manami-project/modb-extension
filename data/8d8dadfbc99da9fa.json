    "text": "Luckily for them, the children are saved by Gamera, a Kaijuu in the form of a giant turtle. But this is not the end of the unwanted adventure for Boco and his friends because they are visited by two agents of the Eustace Foundation, James Tazaki and Emiko Melchiorri, and asked for answers and help because apparently, the Kaijuu are especially targeting children â€¦\n\nIn the sweltering heat of 1989 Tokyo, a group of sixth-grade friends - Boko, Joe, Junichi, and Brody - find their last summer vacation disrupted by the sudden emergence of monstrous creatures known as Kaiju. As these beasts wreak havoc on the city, the boys are left terrified amidst the ruins. Just when all hope seems lost, a colossal turtle-like Kaiju, Gamera, appears to defend them against the deadly Gyaos. Despite its injuries, Gamera valiantly battles the Gyaos, marking the start of the boys' unforgettable 'Summer of Kaiju.'\n\nAs the chaos unfolds, the boys become entangled in a larger conflict when agents from the Eustace Foundation, James Tazaki and Emiko Melchiorri, approach them for help. It appears that the Kaiju are specifically targeting children, making the boys crucial to unraveling the mystery. With Gamera as their protector, the young friends embark on a dangerous journey to save not only themselves but also their city from the relentless Kaiju attacks.",
