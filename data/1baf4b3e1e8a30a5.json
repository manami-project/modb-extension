  "synopsis": {
    "text": "That brings us to a unique bubble universe, where the struggle between ELFs (Equipment: Living Forms) and the Honkai persists, threatening the stability of their world. To prevent imminent collapse, humans have established a special organization, disguised under the charming name 'ELF Academy', to manage and control these sentient beings. In this parallel reality, ELFs and humans coexist peacefully, attending the same institution and engaging in quirky antics, offering a refreshing contrast to the bleak state of the main universe. From Selune's Elegy's dramatic tendencies to Blood Embrace's mischievous behavior, the ELF Academy is a beacon of hope and amusement amidst the ongoing conflict.",
