    "text": "Blade, the legendary vampire hunter, is a unique hybrid born from a vampire's bite to his pregnant mother. With the strength, senses, and regenerative powers of a vampire, but without the fatal weakness to sunlight, Blade is a formidable force. Driven by a thirst for justice for his mother and inner peace, he relentlessly pursues Deacon Frost, the vampire responsible for his mother's death, across Asia. In Japan, Blade encounters 'Existence,' a sinister vampire organization led by Frost, whose members have been alarmingly altered by Frost himself. As a Daywalker, Blade leverages his extraordinary abilities and combat skills to confront this new threat, promising a thrilling and action-packed adventure.",
