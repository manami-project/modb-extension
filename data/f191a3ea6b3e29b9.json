  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 0068 of the Universal Century, Zeon Zum Deikun, a leader seeking independence for the space colonies, suddenly dies amid declaring the Autonomous Republic of Munzo free from the Earth Federation. His death throws the colony into turmoil as the Zabi family seizes power. Deikun's young children, Casval and Artesia, are forced to flee to Earth to escape this coup. Over the next few years, Casval and Artesia are separated as they each get caught up in the chaotic times leading towards war. Using aliases to hide their identities, the siblings each end up becoming mobile suit pilots on opposite sides of the conflict - Casval as the legendary Zeon ace \"Red Comet\" Char Aznable, and Artesia as Earth Federation officer Sayla Mass. The four episodes of this anime provide an origin story for Char and Sayla, depicting the tragedy that set them on this course years before the outbreak of the One Year War. It reveals the early days of the Zeon militia, the development of mobile suits, growing tensions with the Federation, and the events leading to the rise of the Principality of Zeon under the Zabi family's rule.",
