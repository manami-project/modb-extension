    "text": "Otherworldly portals known as Mato have unleashed dangerous creatures called Yomotsu Shuuki, threatening humanity's existence. Simultaneously, special fruits called Peaches have emerged, granting unique abilities to women, enabling them to combat these monsters as part of the government's Anti-demon Corps. High school senior Yuuki Wakura finds himself caught in the middle of this supernatural war when he encounters a Yomotsu Shuuki. Luckily, Kyouka Uzen, the chief of the Seventh Unit of the Anti-demon Corps, rescues him. Recognizing Yuuki's potential to enhance the power of Peaches, Kyouka offers him a chance to join the fight against the monsters as her willing slave, both on the battlefield and in their daily lives. With Yuuki's newfound abilities and Kyouka's leadership, they may just turn the tide against the Yomotsu Shuuki and save the world.",
