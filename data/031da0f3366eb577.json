  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This quirky anime introduces us to Spelunker, a teacher with a peculiar habit of dying and resurrecting frequently. From catching a cold to slipping on the ground, any minor incident can lead to his demise, much to the bemusement of his students and fellow teachers. Despite the regularity of his deaths, Spelunker continues to engage his students with unconventional lessons on traffic safety and amusing lunchtime antics, often involving condiment mishaps. Inspired by the challenging 1983 game \"Spelunker,\" this anime parodies the game's notorious difficulty level through the frequent deaths of its protagonist. Join Spelunker and his students as they navigate the unpredictable and entertaining world of their classroom!",
