However, her reign is not eternal; once her powers start to wane, a new Queen must be chosen. In this thrilling anime, two young women, Rosalia and Angelique, are selected as the final Queen Candidates. They must compete in a contest to determine who will take the throne and become the next Queen of the cosmos.\n\nAs part of the Queen Examination, both Rosalia and Angelique are given their own continent on a planet. Their task is to transform these continents into thriving civilizations and flourishing environments. To assist them, nine Guardians, each controlling different elements such as fire, wind, and water, are chosen.\n\nThroughout their journey, Rosalia and Angelique face various challenges and adventures in the Holy Land, revealing their true abilities. As they get to know the Guardians, the competition intensifies, and the question remains: who will emerge victorious and claim the ultimate prize?",
