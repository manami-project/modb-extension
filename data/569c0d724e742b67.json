With no history, upperclassmen, or reputation, the school offers a clean slate and endless possibilities. Despite her love for singing, Kanon's stage fright caused her to miss her chance to join the music program. However, Keke's passion for school idols reignites Kanon's dream, leading them to form their own group. Facing opposition from Ren Hazuki, the headmaster's daughter, the girls are given a chance to prove themselves: win first place at the Yoyogi School Idol Festival. With determination and enthusiasm, the girls embark on their journey to make their dreams a reality, marking the beginning of their Love Live! story.",
