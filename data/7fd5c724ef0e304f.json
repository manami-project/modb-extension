  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Buddy Complex anime series centers around a final battle between the Free Treaty Alliance and the Zogilia space division, led by an elderly commander named Bizon. The story follows a young pilot named Aoba, who is thrust through time from the future into the past. There, he meets another mecha pilot named Dio and forms a partnership with him known as a \"Buddy Complex.\" In the second half of the series, Aoba is joined by Hina, a female pilot from Zogilia who originally fought against Aoba but comes to question her allegiances. As the battle for Earth's future reaches its climax, Hina must decide whether to side with her former Zogilia comrades or with Aoba and the Alliance. Meanwhile, back in Zogilia, Hina's former team returns home to discover shocking events unfolding. The series was originally slated to end after 13 episodes but was renewed for a two-part finale to bring closure to the central conflict. Over the course of the final episodes, Aoba and Dio fight to break Hina's chains of fate and choose a new future, while a mysterious Zogilia man harboring hatred towards Aoba begins making covert moves. With Earth and time itself in jeopardy, the anime builds towards a dramatic finish.",
