    "text": "Cygnus, the battlefield for the ultimate showdown between the Free Treaty Alliance and Zogiria's space division, witnesses a fierce struggle as Earth's fate and the fabric of time hang in the balance. The elderly Bizon spearheads Zogiria's forces, setting the stage for a dramatic two-part finale to the Buddy Complex television series.\n\nHina, once a loyal Zogilian comrade, faces a crucial decision upon joining Aoba and Dio aboard the Cygnus. As she grapples with her allegiances, her former compatriots return to a transformed Zogilia, where unexpected events unfold.\n\nThe 13th episode of Buddy Complex left viewers on a cliffhanger with a 'To be continued' message, and the official Twitter account and website for the anime have confirmed that the series will indeed persist.\n\nIn the midst of these tumultuous events, Aoba and Dio manage to free Hina from her destined chains, allowing her to embrace a new future. Meanwhile, a mysterious figure harboring a deep-seated grudge against Aoba emerges in Zogilia, covertly setting his plan into motion.",
