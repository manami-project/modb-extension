    "text": "Even with the prestigious title of being the grandson of Japan's strongest goalkeeper, Endou Mamoru faces an uphill battle as the captain of Raimon Middle School's soccer club. Despite his exceptional skills, the team is in shambles, with disinterested members and a lack of dedication. However, the arrival of a talented forward, Shuuya Gouenji, and a challenge from the reigning 40-year Football Frontier champion, Teikoku Academy, sparks a newfound determination in Mamoru. Armed with his grandfather's special training notebook and an unyielding spirit, Mamoru embarks on a mission to recruit new members and transform his team from underdogs into champions. As they face formidable opponents and learn powerful new moves, Mamoru and his team strive to claim victory in the Soccer Frontier tournament. Will their collective efforts and Mamoru's unwavering resolve be enough to bring the once-struggling team to glory?",
