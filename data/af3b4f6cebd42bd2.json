  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kazuma's life takes a dangerous turn when he casually tries on a wish-granting choker from Wiz's magic shop. The choker, however, has a sinister twist: it gradually strangles the wearer until their wish is granted. With no clear idea of what his wish might be, Kazuma and his party members find themselves in a desperate race against time. As the choker tightens, the gang, including Megumin's self-proclaimed rival Yunyun, resort to various antics in an attempt to fulfill Kazuma's unknown wish. From using Wiz's lap as a pillow to engaging in a provocative game of strip rock-paper-scissors, the group tries everything they can think of. But will their efforts be enough to save Kazuma from the deadly choker?",
