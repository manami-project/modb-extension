The brothers uncover that human experimentation aimed at reviving the monstrous Orochi snake, previously thought destroyed, is secretly still taking place. A mysterious scaled man resembling Tenka attacks Soramaru, demanding to know Tenka's whereabouts. Soramaru learns this man is a genetic experiment using Orochi's cells. As Soramaru and the Yamainu paramilitary unit investigate this conspiracy, they uncover dark secrets and must fight former allies to get to the truth. Together, the Kumo brothers take a courageous stand against corrupt forces seeking to revive the Orochi through banned human experimentation. Their fight leads them towards a climactic confrontation with the sinister powers behind this scheme.",
