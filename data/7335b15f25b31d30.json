The three brothers, who had once triumphed over the monstrous serpent, now face a new battle against rogue ex-members of the Yamainu, the very military unit originally formed to eliminate the Orochi.\n\nSoramaru, one of the brothers, finds himself the target of a mysterious assailant, a man bearing large snake scales and an uncanny resemblance to Tenka. This formidable adversary is revealed to be the result of a clandestine experiment using the Orochi's cells. As Soramaru and other Yamainu members delve deeper into the conspiracy, they uncover a tangled web of secrets and are forced to confront former allies in their pursuit of the truth.\n\nIn this gripping tale of brotherhood, betrayal, and redemption, the trio must once again join forces and fight against the very institution they once trusted, to put an end to the sinister plot and save humanity from the resurgence of an ancient evil.",
