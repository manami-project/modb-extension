    "text": "In the fantasy kingdom of Popolocrois, young Prince Pietro enjoys a peaceful life with his kind father, King Paul, and mother, Queen Sania, who united their human and dragon races through marriage. When the scheming sorcerer GamiGami unsuccessfully tries taking over the kingdom, an explosion in the forest leads Pietro and his friend Narcia to discover a mysterious amnesiac girl named Hyuu. They soon learn Hyuu belongs to the extinct wind race and aim to uncover her forgotten past. Joined by eccentric friends, the good-natured Pietro embarks on adventures where he must use his half-dragon abilities to protect both his kingdom and discover Hyuu's origins in hopes of finding her home in time. Through tests of courage and wisdom, the young prince strives to bridge divisions in this magical realm.",
