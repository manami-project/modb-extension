  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryu Prince Pietro, heir to the harmonious kingdom of Popolocrois, is the offspring of a noble union between the benevolent King Paul and Queen Sania, a daughter of the Ryu clan. The birth of this half-human, half-dragon prince marks a significant milestone in bridging the gap between the humans and the Ryu clan.\n\nOne fateful day, while playing with his forest witch companion, Narcia, Pietro encounters the nefarious GamiGami Maou, who is hell-bent on seizing the kingdom. When GamiGami Maou's castle-swapping scheme backfires, it results in a catastrophic explosion in the heart of the forest. Amidst the wreckage, Pietro and Narcia discover a mysterious girl, who turns out to be Hyuu, a member of the long-lost wind-kind.\n\nWith only fragmented memories of her past, Hyuu and Pietro embark on an adventure to unravel the truth behind her people's disappearance and find a way for her to return to her own time. Joined by their friends, they navigate the challenges posed by GamiGami Maou, who continues to pose a threat to the kingdom of Popolocrois. Will Pietro and Hyuu succeed in their quest and safeguard their kingdom? Only time will tell.",
