  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime consists of a series of short stories depicting tender moments from everyday family life. They were created as commercials for Marukome Co., Ltd., a manufacturer of miso soup pastes and other Japanese food products. The shorts capture nostalgic scenes like a mother bonding with her son, a child sneaking a midnight snack, or a young adult living away from home for the first time. Others portray the touching experience of becoming a parent and the importance of togetherness between loved ones. With its gentle slice-of-life vignettes, this anime aims to remind viewers of the small but meaningful interactions that make a family. Evoking wistful memories of childhood, homesickness, summertime adventures, and more, it puts a spotlight on the little things that nurture relationships over a lifetime. Ultimately, through its heartwarming depiction of family connections, this series hopes to resonate with viewers and promote the comforting, homemade taste of Marukome's miso soup and other products.",
