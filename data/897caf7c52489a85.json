  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around the Yamamoto family, consisting of father Tetsuo, mother Misuzu, eldest daughter Shizuka, younger daughter Ikumi, and their two pet cats Joe and Beth. Shizuka is an overweight and unmarried woman in her 30s who enjoys drinking beer. She lives at home and shows no interest in getting married, much to the annoyance of her mother Misuzu who worries for her daughter's future. However, Shizuka gets along well with her younger sister Ikumi, even though they have occasional fights. Tetsuo feels overwhelmed as the only male in this all-female household. Between his wife's nagging about their unmarried daughter, his daughters' fights, and the demands of his job as a minor civil servant, Tetsuo has a lot to handle. Yet, underneath it all, they are a closely bonded family. While seemingly ordinary, the Yamamoto household is prone to comedic mishaps and strange occurrences. Their eccentric yet heartwarming family dynamic will have readers laughing out loud.",
