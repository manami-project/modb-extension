  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wakakusa no Charlotte is a light-hearted anime that follows the comedic misadventures of the all-female Wakakusa family. The eldest daughter, Shizuka, is a 30-year-old, beer-loving, unmarried woman who lives at home, much to her mother's chagrin. Her mother is torn between her annoyance at Shizuka's lack of interest in marriage and her concern about her daughter's shrinking window of eligibility. Meanwhile, Shizuka's younger sister, Ikumi, is a student who shares a love-hate relationship with her older sibling. The family's father, a minor civil servant, feels henpecked in this female-dominated household, which also includes two female cats, Joe and Beth. Despite the family's constant bickering and occasional tragic events, they are a heartwarming and relatable bunch. The original manga is currently serialized in Takeshobo's Manga Club, and the title is a playful nod to the long-running Nippon Animation version of Little Women, 'Ai no Wakakusa Monogatari.'",
