    "text": "The anime \"Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku\" is a spin-off from \"Lucky Star,\" shifting the spotlight to the Miyakawa sisters, Hinata and Hikage. The story revolves around their daily struggles to make ends meet, thanks to Hinata's excessive spending on otaku merchandise. Despite working part-time at a doujinshi store, Hinata's earnings are quickly squandered on manga, leaving the sisters in a constant state of financial hardship.\n\nAs the younger sibling, Hikage navigates the trials and tribulations of elementary school while simultaneously dealing with the challenges of living in near-poverty. Hinata's impulsive buying habits often lead to absurd cost-cutting measures, much to Hikage's dismay. Despite the hardships, Hikage remains hopeful that her older sister will eventually learn to curb her spending and put food on the table.\n\nThis heartwarming and humorous tale offers a glimpse into the lives of the Miyakawa sisters as they navigate the ups and downs of life, all while dealing with the consequences of Hinata's otaku lifestyle. Will Hinata ever learn the value of a dollar, or will the sisters continue to live in financial ruin? Only time will tell in \"Miyakawa-ke no Kuufuku.\"",
