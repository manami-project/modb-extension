  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Miyakawa Hikage is a young elementary school girl who lives in poverty with her older sister Hinata. Despite working a part-time job, Hinata spends most of her income on manga and anime merchandise, leaving the sisters perpetually broke. As a result, nine-year-old Hikage struggles daily with her sister's extreme cost-cutting measures just to put food on the table. Hinata finds justification even for the most absurd money-saving ideas. Meanwhile, her stacks of otaku purchases continue to pile up around their home. Though formerly minor characters in Lucky Star, the Miyakawa sisters now take center stage. The audience joins Hikage in hoping her sister will eventually see reason and moderate her wasteful otaku habits. But it seems Hinata cannot resist finding a rationale for every new frugal scheme, no matter how bizarre. This comedic spin-off centers on the daily trials of the Miyakawa household as earnest young Hikage attempts to cope with her sister's obsessive fandom and its consequences. Despite perpetually empty wallets, the siblings stick together through even the most absurd austerity tactics.",
