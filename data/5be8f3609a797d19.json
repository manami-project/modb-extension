    "text": "When Yuzuru and Azusa were young children, they were promised to each other in an arranged marriage. However, over time Yuzuru forgot about this promise as he grew into a normal teenager. He became the captain of his high school archery team and fell in love with his teammate, Satomi. This all changes when Azusa's mother passes away under mysterious circumstances. Azusa decides to honor the childhood marriage promise, no matter what. She returns to claim Yuzuru, posing a threat to his relationship with Satomi. It seems Azusa may be hiding a dark secret and has developed frightening supernatural powers. Satomi fears for her life as Azusa tries to remove her from standing in the way of her claim on Yuzuru. Yuzuru must now try to protect Satomi from this newly emerged evil, struggling against sinister forces to preserve their love.",
