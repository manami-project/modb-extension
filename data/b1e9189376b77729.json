    "text": "Katari is a young, aspiring writer who dreams of becoming a novelist one day. As a budding storyteller, she often writes short stories in her free time and is preparing to enter an upcoming writing competition. However, Katari finds herself preoccupied with another endeavor - confessing her love to her handsome classmate. Mustering courage, she pens a heartfelt love letter to him for Valentine's Day. Unfortunately, her affection goes unreciprocated. Crestfallen, Katari returns to writing to process her disappointment. Serendipitously, one particular story she crafts profoundly impacts a little girl named Zenbi. Despite her own romantic troubles, Katari's creative efforts manage to touch Zenbi's heart and serve as an inspiration. Though the path of young love often proves rocky, Katari discovers her writing can spread warmth to others when she least expects it.",
