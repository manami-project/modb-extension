  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Love, in its purest form, often finds its way into the most unexpected hearts. This is the story of Hoshikawa Katari, a budding novelist who finds inspiration in her own experiences of first love and heartbreak. As she pens a heartfelt love letter to her school crush, she unwittingly crafts a tale that resonates deeply with a young girl named Zenbi. Though her confession doesn't yield the desired response, Katari's emotional journey serves as a powerful catalyst for her writing, leading her to create a story that touches hearts in ways she never imagined. This heartwarming tale, beautifully animated by Imperial Boy, is a testament to the transformative power of love and the written word.",
