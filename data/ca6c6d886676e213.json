  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in 1991 during the fighting game boom, Hi Score Girl follows the unlikely friendship between two sixth graders - Haruo Yaguchi and Akira Oono. Haruo is an average and unpopular boy whose only talent is that he excels at arcade video games. His life revolves around spending all his free time at the local arcade. One day he encounters Akira, a pretty and wealthy classmate who surprisingly destroys him at Street Fighter II. Despite their vastly different backgrounds, Akira keeps coming to the arcade to challenge Haruo. Though initially frustrated by her superior gaming skills, Haruo comes to appreciate having a rival who can match his abilities. Over time, the two form an unexpected bond over their shared love of video games, even as Haruo strives to reclaim his arcade reputation by defeating Akira. With engaging characters and nostalgia for retro games, Hi Score Girl is a quirky coming-of-age comedy about an unlikely friendship forged through the power of play.",
