    "text": "Kurenai's life takes an unexpected turn when the 16-year-old high school student and skilled mediator is assigned to protect a seven-year-old girl named Murasaki. Despite his young age, Kurenai is a seasoned martial artist who has resolved numerous disputes for his employer, Benika. However, protecting Murasaki proves to be a challenging task as she hails from an affluent and influential family, and is completely oblivious to the ways of the world outside her luxurious life.\n\nAs Kurenai navigates the complexities of his new assignment, he finds himself growing closer to Murasaki, who is equally perplexed by everyday activities like shopping. Meanwhile, Kurenai is still expected to perform his usual mediation tasks and maintain his social life, all while keeping Murasaki safe.\n\nHowever, danger lurks in the shadows as everyone, including Kurenai, seems to be hiding secrets. As the bond between Kurenai and Murasaki deepens, they must confront the challenges that lie ahead and uncover the truth about Murasaki's family and the real threat against her. Will Kurenai be able to protect Murasaki and help her adjust to her new life, or will the dangers that surround them prove to be too much to handle? Only time will tell.",
