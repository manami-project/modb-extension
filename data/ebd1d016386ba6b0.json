    "text": "Running downhill through her small town, Fumiko, a young schoolgirl, finds herself unable to stop, her speed increasing with every step. This unusual turn of events follows an emotional confession of love to a boy named Takeshi, who, with a heart full of baseball dreams, gently rejects her. This poignant tale, which won the Award of Excellence at the 2010 Tokyo International Anime Award, beautifully captures the heartache and determination of young love.",
