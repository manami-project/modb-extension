  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Plantation, a mobile fortress city, is the last bastion of humanity in a future where Earth has been left in ruins. Within this city lies Mistilteinn, colloquially known as the 'birdcage,' where children are raised and trained for a single purpose: to battle the enigmatic, colossal creatures known as Kyouryuu. Their weapons of choice are robotic machines called Franxx, and the children's existence is validated only by their ability to pilot these machines.\n\nOnce hailed as a prodigy, Hiro, code number 016, has fallen from grace and is now considered expendable. His inability to pilot a Franxx has left him feeling insignificant and purposeless. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a mysterious girl named Zero Two, who sports a pair of horns. She greets him with a familiar smile and addresses him as her 'darling.'\n\nAs the Plantation faces the relentless onslaught of the Kyouryuu, Hiro's chance at redemption and relevance comes in the form of Zero Two, but the cost of this newfound purpose may be more than he bargained for. Will he be able to reclaim his lost glory and prove his existence, or will he be consumed by the very battles he was bred to fight? Only time will tell.",
