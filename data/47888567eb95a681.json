    "text": "There exists a humble abode, an old apartment building, where a part-time worker named Sousuke Aikawa resides. Despite its dilapidated state, the apartment has two charming attractions: a captivating landlady and an adorable girl living in the apartment above Sousuke's. One fateful day, an unexpected cacophony of creaking sounds echoes from the ceiling, culminating in a sudden crash. The girl from upstairs, Sunao Unyuu, plummets through the newly formed hole in the ceiling, landing directly on Sousuke's bed.\n\nThis serendipitous incident marks the beginning of an amusing and chaotic cohabitation between Sousuke and Sunao. As the upper apartment becomes uninhabitable, the compassionate landlady, Yuki Shimizu, must devise a cost-effective solution to accommodate the three of them. This fortuitous event entwines the lives of these three individuals, leading to a series of comedic and heartwarming moments under one roof.\n\nWith their living arrangements now intertwined, how will this peculiar love triangle unfold? Only time will tell as Sousuke navigates through this unpredictable, yet delightful, living situation with his two beautiful housemates.",
