  "synopsis": {
    "text": "An elite task force, known as Spriggans, are entrusted with a critical mission: to safeguard the remnants of an ancient civilization that once thrived on Earth. This civilization, despite its remarkable technological advancements, met its demise, leaving behind enigmatic artifacts scattered across the globe. These relics possess immense power, capable of both creation and destruction.\n\nIn the wrong hands, these artifacts could spell doom for humanity. The ARCAM corporation, a secret organization, understands the gravity of this threat and deploys its Spriggan agents to prevent rogue factions from harnessing this power. Among these agents are Yu Ominae, a fearless Japanese operative, and Jean-Jacques Mondo, a skilled French agent. Together, they stand as the world's last line of defense against power-hungry adversaries.\n\nHigh in the Ararat Mountains of Turkey, a race against time unfolds. The U.S. Machine Corps., a rogue division of the Pentagon, seeks to seize control of what is believed to be Noah's Ark, aiming to exploit its power for global dominance. Led by Col. MacDougall, a boy with deadly psionic abilities, they pose a formidable threat. It's up to Yu and Jean-Jacques to thwart their plans and ensure the ancient civilization's legacy remains sealed. The future of humanity hangs in the balance, and the Spriggans are its only hope.",
