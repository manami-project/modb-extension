Amidst this turmoil, her constant companion is her extraordinary dog, Junkers, who possesses the uncanny ability to communicate in human language and perform tasks like a person. When Hiromi's world is rocked by the news of her parents' potential divorce, Junkers reveals an additional secret: he can bestow three miracles upon her. As Hiromi navigates the intricate web of her desires and the consequences they might have on her loved ones, she discovers that life has a peculiar way of unfolding.
