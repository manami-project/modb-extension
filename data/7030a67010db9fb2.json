Her closest companion is her pet dog, Junkers, who has the miraculous ability to speak. As her parent's marriage grows tense and divorce looms, Hiromi faces mounting troubles. Junkers then reveals he can grant three wishes, offering Hiromi an escape that could fix her family or only lead to more hurt. This poignant anime follows Hiromi's childhood struggles with love, school, and family, accompanied by her extraordinary canine friend. Though still a child, Hiromi must find the wisdom to wish rightly as her world threatens to fall apart.",
