  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story is set in 18th century Europe during a time when the Goddess Athena and Hades, ruler of the Underworld, have been battling in a long-running \"Holy War.\" The main characters are three childhood friends - Tenma, Alone, and Sasha. Tenma is a determined and courageous young man training to become a Saint and serve Athena. His kind friend Alone has a special artistic talent but is chosen to be the human vessel for Hades against his will. Sasha is revealed to be the reincarnation of Athena. Though they were once as close as siblings, Tenma and Alone end up on opposing sides as Alone takes on the role of Hades and Tenma becomes the Pegasus Saint. Despite their friendship, they seem fated to battle as part of this age-old war between Athena and the Underworld. Sasha/Athena also becomes caught up in the conflict. The story serves as a prequel to the original Saint Seiya series. It promises epic battles between Saints and Specters as well as emotional drama, as close bonds are tested by the characters' opposing destinies. Will their friendship survive this Holy War - or will the cyclical battle between Athena and Hades tear them apart?",
