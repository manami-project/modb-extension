  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Big Comic Spirits brings you an action-packed comedy that dives into the sexually charged fantasies of a young man, as depicted in the manga by TAGAMI Yoshihisa. This anime boasts a unique blend of four distinct art styles: a classic manga aesthetic, a super-deformed (SD) style, a realistic approach, and an art-graphic pencil design. The narrative takes unexpected turns, interspersing moments of exaggerated humor and even incorporating live-action elements. Prepare for a one-of-a-kind visual experience that explores the wild and unpredictable journey of a young man's desires.",
