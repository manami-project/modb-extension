  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime is an action comedy that follows the sexual fantasies and experiences of a young man. It incorporates four distinct art styles - manga, super-deformed, realistic, and graphic pencil art - to visually depict the main character's imaginings and encounters. While humorous at times, especially when utilizing the exaggerated super-deformed style, the anime also aims to provide an honest portrait of the sex life of a young adult. It is based on a manga by Tagami Yoshihisa that was serialized in the manga magazine Big Comic Spirits. By blending multiple artistic styles with comedic and dramatic storytelling, this anime offers an uniquely creative exploration of the complicated realm of human sexuality and relationships. Those seeking an entertaining take on the subject matter will find much to enjoy.",
