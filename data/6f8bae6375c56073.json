  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kazukiâ€™s life takes a dramatic turn when the seemingly ordinary high school student, known more for his mediocre grades than anything else, finds himself thrust into a world where his peculiar visions of colossal robots engaged in relentless battles become a tangible reality. As the only person privy to these visions, Kazuki has always been somewhat of an outlier among his peers. However, his unique ability piques the interest of a brilliant physicist named Ken Sanada, who believes that Kazuki's visions are a portal to an alternate universe.\n\nIn an unexpected twist of fate, Kazuki is unwittingly catapulted into this parallel world by one of Ken's experimental inventions. In this new reality, the once-imaginary robots are not only real but are also locked in a fierce battle for global domination. At the heart of this conflict is the nefarious organization, RaRa, which Kazuki must now confront head-on.\n\nJoining forces with a local company, Kazuki assumes the role of a robot pilot, finding himself at the epicenter of a war that will determine the fate of this parallel world. As he navigates this unfamiliar landscape, Kazuki remains steadfast in his quest to restore peace and find his way back home. Will he be able to rise to the challenge and harness his visions to save both worlds? Only time will tell.",
