Enter Flint, a caveman from the Stone Age, who, along with his father, was transformed into fossils and rediscovered in the future. Thanks to the intervention of Doctor Bernard Goodman, Flint returns to his human form, while his father becomes a sentient granite block that doubles as a handy hammer.\n\nFlint, imbued with supernatural strength and a kind heart, joins the Time Bureau to locate the dangerous time-altering devices and restore history. Accompanied by his father, the resourceful Tony, and the brave Sarah, Flint embarks on a thrilling journey through time. They must outwit Petra Fina, the Dark Lord's loyal minion, who is hell-bent on capturing the time angels for her master's sinister purposes.\n\nFrom encountering ancient samurais to crossing paths with Christopher Columbus, Flint and his friends will experience a myriad of adventures. Will they be able to unite and thwart Petra Fina's evil plans, or will history remain forever altered? Join Flint and his friends in this action-packed, time-traveling escapade to find out!",
