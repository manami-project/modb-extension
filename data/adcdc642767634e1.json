Born into a prestigious clan, Matsuri is dedicated to protecting his town and Suzu from the harmful ayakashi, while Suzu, an ayakashi medium, befriends them. Their differing views on ayakashi create tension, especially when Suzu's immense vitality attracts the dangerous 'King of Ayakashi,' Shirogane. In an attempt to save Suzu from Shirogane's clutches, Matsuri seals the ayakashi's powers but falls victim to a curse that transforms him into a girl. Now, Matsuri must adapt to his new life while battling hostile ayakashi and safeguarding Suzu, who grapples with her growing feelings for her transformed friend. As they navigate this complex situation, the trio's relationships and identities are put to the test in this thrilling and heartwarming anime.",
