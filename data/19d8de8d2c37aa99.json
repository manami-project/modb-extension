    "text": "Will Selfault enrolls in the prestigious Regarden Magic Academy with dreams of reaching the pinnacle of the magical world, hoping to fulfill a childhood promise. However, there is one significant obstacle - Will possesses no magical abilities whatsoever. In a realm dominated by powerful sorcerers, Will's lack of magic leaves him struggling amongst his gifted peers. Yet Will refuses to surrender his dream. Armed with an ordinary sword and tireless perseverance, he confronts perilous trials - battling dungeon monsters to earn academic credits and deflecting the cruelty of those who resent his audacity. Hardships only steel Will's determination as he strives to unlock the potential within himself. At the core of Will's quest lies the memory of a heartfelt vow from younger days. More than personal glory, he seeks the power to reshape a society stratified by magic. With steadfast courage, Will fights for that forgotten pledge and to transform the world into one where everyone has equal chance to ascend to the top.",
