  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After the climactic battle against the destructive dragon Bahamut, the warriors who banded together have gone their separate ways. Yet their paths cross again in two insightful interludes. In the first vignette, the roguish bounty hunter Favaro returns to his hometown, accompanied by the stalwart knight Kaiser. Their visit stirs up memories both pleasant and painful for Favaro, revealing his motivations and his complex history with Kaiser. The second story centers on Kaiser and the holy warrior Jeanne, now serving together as Orleans Knights. A friendly sparring match leads to a heartfelt discussion about why they chose to remain and help rebuild despite the war's tragic outcome. Though battered, their camaraderie and spirit remain unbroken. These two tales shine light on the central figures in the age-old fight against Bahamut. Whether reminiscing over the past or working to improve the future, their commitment to their causes and to each other drives them inexorably onward to new adventures.",
