  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so begins the magical journey of 'Mahou Shoujo Taisen', a unique project born from the creative minds behind the Otaku variety show, 2.5 Dimension TV. The anime introduces us to a vibrant cast of magical girls, each representing a local town in Japan, with their origins tracing back to a series of illustration competitions held on pixiv.\n\nIn this fantastical world, Japan's 47 prefectures are personified as ordinary girls bestowed with extraordinary powers to combat the looming darkness. A mythical dragon slumbers beneath the land, providing prosperity in its slumber but unleashing chaos when it stirs. As the dragon's movements cause impurities to manifest as evil forces, the gods respond by dividing their powers and entrusting them to a divine messenger.\n\nThe messenger's mission is to gather chosen ones, known as Magica, who possess the ability to purge the impurities. Armed with the gods' powers transformed into magical weapons, these Magica stand as the last line of defense against the impending doom threatening Japan. Join the Magica in their epic battle to protect their homeland and maintain harmony in 'Mahou Shoujo Taisen'.",
