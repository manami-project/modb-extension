His life takes a turn when he lands in Tokyo's slums and catches the eye of Danpei Tange, a down-on-his-luck former boxing trainer.

Upon his release, Joe embarks on a boxing career under Danpei's tutelage, aiming to face Rikiishi in the ring. However, Joe's volatile nature and past habits threaten his progress.
