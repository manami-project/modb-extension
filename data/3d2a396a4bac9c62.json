    "text": "Just as the chill of winter descends, so too does the end of high school for a group of students. With graduation looming, they find themselves simply counting down the days until they can leave their high school lives behind. However, the monotony of their final semester is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of a familiar face. A former classmate, who had moved away years ago, returns, stirring up old memories and igniting new emotions. This reunion, though seemingly inconvenient, breathes life into their otherwise mundane existence, forcing them to confront feelings they thought they had left behind. As they navigate their last days of high school, they discover that endings can often lead to new beginnings. This is the story of \"Just Because!\", a tale of friendship, love, and the bittersweet journey of growing up.",
