  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After narrowly avoiding destruction from an asteroid collision, the spaceship Sidonia sets course for the Lem system, seeking to eliminate the extraterrestrial threat of the Gauna by striking at their nest. Sidonia's authorities plan a daring preemptive attack, hoping to gain the upper hand against the relentless enemy that has plagued them. Ace pilot Nagate Tanikaze and his squadmates must once again risk their lives to defend Sidonia. But this time they have a powerful new ally on their side - a sentient human-Gauna hybrid named Tsumugi Shiraui who possesses destructive capabilities. After the recent losses from the asteroid near-miss, Captain Kobayashi decides to seize full authority over Sidonia, aiming to wipe out the Gauna completely. Her ambitious plan relies on two key developments: newly created long-range anti-Gauna weapons, and Tsumugi, the first-ever Gauna-human chimera. Facing skepticism over Tsumugi's origins, Kobayashi turns to Tanikaze due to his personal connection to the Gauna. As the decisive battle draws imminent, Tanikaze cherishes his final days of peace with his friend Izana, even as Kobayashi secretly pursues another doomsday weapon that could determine Sidonia's fate.",
