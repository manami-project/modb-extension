  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kimagure Orange Road OVA continues the story of Kyousuke Kasuga, Madoka Ayukawa, and Hikaru Hiyama. In these additional episodes, their complex love triangle faces new challenges. While studying for exams, Kyousuke temporarily swaps bodies with his pet cat and fish due to his grandfather's magic rope. Though intended to make his life easier, Kyousuke struggles with his new forms. During a Hawaiian vacation, Hikaru gets kidnapped, forcing Kyousuke to rescue her without revealing his supernatural powers to Madoka. Meanwhile, Kyousuke's cousin Akane visits and causes chaos with her shape-shifting abilities. She even disguises herself as Madoka in an attempt to become Kyousuke's romantic rival. In a bizarre turn of events, Kyousuke and a pop idol switch bodies shortly before she's meant to perform at a local music festival. He scrambles to get his body back without anyone discovering his secret. The OVA also depicts Madoka's confusion when she suspects her visiting father is having an affair. This causes her to question her views on relationships. Through these fantastical incidents, the main trio's bonds of friendship and romance are tested. Though comedic at times, the underlying drama and tensions remain.",
