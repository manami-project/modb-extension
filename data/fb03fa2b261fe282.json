    "text": "This animated short tells the poignant story of a motorbike longing for its glory days of the past. Despite its faded paint and worn tires, the bike retains an adventurous spirit. When it works up the courage to take a bold leap into the unknown, the bike rediscovers its own capability for speed and freedom. As it races confidently down an open road toward the horizon, the once-weary bike seems to have found a new lease on life. With its themes of nostalgia, bravery, and self-determination, this 2017 graduate project from the Tokyo University of the Artsâ€™ Department of Animation promises to take viewers on an uplifting emotional journey. Its creative vision and excellent execution will resonate with anyone who has yearned to regain lost vibrancy.",
