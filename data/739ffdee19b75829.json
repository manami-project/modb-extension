  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japan's finest – a martial artist, a Hollywood star, and a high school student with a penchant for guns – along with their formidable tank, find themselves inexplicably transported to a realm brimming with magic and elves. In an attempt to send them back, the elves' unstable leader performs a spell that goes awry, shattering into fragments that embed themselves onto the skin of various elven maidens. With no other choice, the trio embarks on a wild and unconventional quest to find these elves and inspect their bodies, hoping to reunite the spell fragments and secure their passage home. As they traverse this magical world in their tank, they leave behind a trail of disrobed elves and a reputation as the notorious elf hunters.",
