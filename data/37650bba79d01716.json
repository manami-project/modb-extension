    "text": "Shiro Kishibe lends his voice to a delightful music video, originally sung by Kouichi Kawatsu, which aired on NHK's popular Minna no Uta program. The animated short, first released in 1975, tells the charming tale of a plump little king with a whimsical dream: to soar through the skies on a magical flying carpet. Despite its rebroadcast in 1983 with a new singer, the enchanting animation remains unchanged, captivating audiences with its timeless appeal.",
