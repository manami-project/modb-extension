  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a cataclysmic earthquake in 2050 transformed the moon into a habitable and popular tourist destination, rumors of magical, long-eared beings began to circulate. In the year 2100, Daichi, a young adventurer from Earth, embarks on a solo summer vacation to the moon, eager to witness these enigmatic creatures for himself. Little does he know that his curiosity will lead him into the heart of an ancient conflict between two lunar races: the benevolent long-eared tribe and the malevolent Jado race, bent on universal domination and the resurrection of ancient evil forces to seize control of Earth.\n\nDaichi's journey takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a young, furry-eared girl and her grandmother, V-May, who draw him into a grand adventure. Together with two other children, Daichi is chosen as a 'Madou Senshi' - a magical warrior destined to pilot colossal robots known as Granzorts. As the newly formed team unites, they must harness their newfound powers to release the legendary Mado King and liberate the long-eared tribe's kingdom, Rabiluna, from the clutches of the Jado race, ultimately saving the universe from impending doom.",
