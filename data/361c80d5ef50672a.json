  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chuzo Aochi's Kobu-Tori presents the tale of two elderly men, Tarobei and Jirobei, each bearing an unsightly lump on their faces. Tarobei, a diligent and honest individual, discovers a magical realm of mythical creatures while seeking shelter in a tree during a storm. Invited to a lively gathering of long-nosed goblins, Tarobei entertains them with a humorous dance, which leads to the removal of his facial deformity as a reward.\n\nUpon sharing his miraculous experience with Jirobei, a greedy and lazy man, the latter seizes the opportunity to attend the next gathering in hopes of a similar reward. However, Jirobei's selfish dance and ulterior motives anger the goblins. As punishment, they return the lump taken from Tarobei and bestow it upon Jirobei, leaving him with lumps on both cheeks.\n\nThis captivating anime, brought to life by Yokohama Cinema and Yasuji Murata's artistry, offers a unique blend of folklore and morality, inviting viewers to immerse themselves in a mystical world filled with enchanting creatures and valuable life lessons.",
