    "text": "Travellers of the cosmos, the Space Travelers, find themselves in the midst of a colossal conflict in the year New Cosmic Century 038. An enigmatic alien civilization known as the Orbital Ring System (ORS) has launched a sudden and devastating attack on humanity, severing the Earth Civilization Sphere from its space colonies and taking complete control. Amidst this chaos, only Hayabusha Jetter and his motley crew of space pirates and smugglers dare to defy the ORS, transporting crucial supplies and information between Earth and the colonies.\n\nWhen an intriguing stranger approaches the Space Travelers with a mysterious, unmarked spherical container, Jetter and his crew accept the delivery mission without hesitation. Little do they know, this seemingly ordinary package may hold the secret to humanity's salvation. As they navigate the treacherous path to deliver the container, the Space Travelers must evade the ORS's relentless security, all while aiding an underground resistance movement. With the fate of mankind hanging in the balance, can Jetter and his crew survive long enough to unlock the key to humanity's destiny?",
