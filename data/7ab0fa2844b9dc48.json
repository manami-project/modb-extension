  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around a protagonist who is spending time with friends, but grows bored of the conversation. As a result, his mind frequently wanders to his own imaginary world, only to return back to reality and his friends. This causes the flow of conversation to falter. Over the course of several mental trips to his imagination, the protagonist gradually comes to feel that his fantasy world is lacking in substance. This leads him to take more interest in sustaining the real-world conversation and developing interpersonal relationships. Ultimately, he decides to fully engage with his friends rather than retreating into his imagination. The anime is a 1st year student work from 2010 by Naoaki Shibuta. It was produced at the Tokyo University of the Arts' Graduate School of Film and New Media within the Department of Animation.",
