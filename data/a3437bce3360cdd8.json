  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nagisa Furukawa, a friendless and seemingly clumsy girl, crosses paths with Tomoya Okazaki, a disillusioned third-year high school student who has lost interest in his studies and life. As Tomoya grapples with his strained relationship with his father, who turned to alcohol and gambling after the loss of his wife, he finds himself drawn to Nagisa's loneliness. Nagisa, who was held back a year due to illness, dreams of reviving the school's drama club.\n\nInitially indifferent, Tomoya begins to spend more time with Nagisa, helping her reestablish the club. As they work together, Tomoya's relationships with other students at the school deepen, and he finds himself opening up to them. Despite his initial reluctance, Tomoya becomes increasingly involved in the lives of these students, learning about their struggles and helping them overcome their obstacles.\n\nAs Tomoya's bond with Nagisa and the other students grows, he starts to realize that life might not be as dull and meaningless as he once thought. Set in a Japanese high school, \"Clannad\" follows Tomoya's journey as he discovers the importance of friendship, love, and the power of connection in shaping one's life.",
