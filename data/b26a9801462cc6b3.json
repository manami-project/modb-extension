    "text": "Royal Investigation Service (RIS) agent Keith Kazama Flick teams up with young investigator Lily Hoshina to track down the infamous serial killer, Killer B, who's wreaking havoc in the technologically advanced archipelago of Cremona. As the duo closes in on their target, they become entangled in a web of crimes orchestrated by the enigmatic organization, Market Maker. Meanwhile, a group of genetically engineered \"perfect humans\" are kidnapped by an evil organization seeking world domination.\n\nAt the heart of this chaos is Koku, a mysterious boy living with the Hoshina family, who may hold the key to unraveling the dark secrets surrounding the RIS, the serial killings, and Keith's own tragic past. As the stakes grow higher and the line between friend and foe blurs, Keith, Lily, and Koku must navigate a world of political corruption, human experimentation, and domestic terrorism to bring the true culprits to justice and restore order to Cremona.",
