    "text": "Tsukasa Akeuraji once dreamed of becoming a renowned figure skater and standing on the Olympic podium. However, he started too late and his hopes were crushed. Now resigned to a lackluster skating career, his passion is reignited when he meets Inori Yuitsuka, a determined fifth grader who secretly practices skating despite being told she also began too late. Seeing his old dreams and tenacity reflected in Inori, Tsukasa takes the young girl under his wing and vows to coach her into becoming an Olympic medalist. Together, the unlikely pair chases the ice skating glory that long eluded them both. Their journey pushes them to overcome naysayers and self-doubt as they strive to fulfill Inori's Olympic dream. More than medals, they seek to inspire others to never abandon their ambitions no matter the obstacles.",
