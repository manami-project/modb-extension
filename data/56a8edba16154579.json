  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The year is 1966, as the Vietnam War looms in the distance, an unseen terror lurks in the shadows of a U.S. military base in Japan. A clandestine organization sends their best operative, the enigmatic Saya, to infiltrate the base and eliminate the sinister force that has been preying on unsuspecting victims. Saya, a vampire unlike any other, is uniquely suited for the task; she possesses none of the typical vampiric traits, such as aversion to sunlight or fangs, and is instead an expert assassin with a lethal Japanese sword.\n\nHer mission: to seek out and destroy the bat-like creatures known as Chiropterans, who have infiltrated the base and are posing as humans. These vicious beings drink human blood and, once they've consumed enough, can lay dormant for extended periods, making them nearly impossible to detect. To get closer to her quarry, Saya assumes the identity of a high school student at a nearby school. As she delves deeper into her investigation, she discovers that the threat is closer than she ever imagined. With the lives of countless humans hanging in the balance, Saya must use her exceptional skills to vanquish the Chiropterans and put an end to the bloodshed.",
