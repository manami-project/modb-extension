    "text": "He avily bullied and ostracized, Seiichi Hiiragi's school life is a daily torment due to his unattractive appearance. But one day, a self-proclaimed deity interrupts the school's PA system, announcing the entire student body's transportation to an alternate realm. This new world operates on game-like mechanics, with levels, stats, and skills. However, Seiichi is left behind in the transfer process, as no one is willing to team up with him. Eventually sent to a remote forest, Seiichi's luck takes a turn when he discovers and consumes the 'Fruit of Evolution.' This enigmatic fruit sets Seiichi on a path of growth, transforming his once pitiful existence into a journey of self-discovery and triumph in a world filled with magic and adventure.",
