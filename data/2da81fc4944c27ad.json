  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Too young to be a hero but brimming with dreams of becoming a renowned voice actress, 10-year-old Watanabe Poemi finds herself in a whirlwind of chaos when extraterrestrial invaders descend upon Tokyo, claiming the lives of her parents. In a twist of fate, Poemi encounters a talking fish, which she transforms into a magical wand, and assumes the identity of the enchanting Magical Girl Puni Puni Poemi.\n\nAs part of the Aasu sisterhood, Poemi and her classmate Futaba, who takes her in after the tragic loss of her parents, are Earth's best hope against the alien onslaught. However, their powers, such as superhuman speed and flower conjuring, seem laughably inadequate against their intergalactic adversaries.\n\nPuni Puni Poemi is a spin-off from the iconic anime satire, Excel Saga, and serves up a generous helping of parody, drawing inspiration from shoujo, shounen, ecchi, hentai, and everything in between. This eccentric and audacious show is the anime equivalent of 'Scary Movie,' making it a wild and entertaining ride for mature audiences.",
