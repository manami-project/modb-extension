    "text": "Features a trio of heroes known as Sonic Soldier Borgman, this science fiction anime combines elements of super sentai with a non-gattai twist. Set in the futuristic Megalocity, built on the ruins of Tokyo that was destroyed by a catastrophic event, the city is under constant threat from Youma, malevolent beings from another dimension. The Borgman team, consisting of Ryo, Chuck, and Anise, don cyber suits powered by Baltector energy to defend the city and its citizens.\n\nBy day, Ryo, Chuck, and Anise lead ordinary lives as teachers, but when danger looms, they transform into the Borgman using the code 'Borg. Get On'. Each member wields a personal cyber cannon that matches their armor color, used to eliminate the monstrous threats they face. Ryo, the leader, is aided by his self-upgrading, talking motorcycle, while their students sometimes assist or inadvertently cause trouble for the Borgman.\n\nAs the Youma continue their ruthless invasion, intent on ruling Earth, the Sonic Soldier Borgman stand as humanity's last hope against Lord Mesh and his nefarious forces. Will they be able to protect their city and keep their secret identities safe? Join the adventure to find out!",
