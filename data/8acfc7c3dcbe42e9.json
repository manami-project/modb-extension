  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sonic Soldier Borgman takes place in a futuristic version of Tokyo called Megalocity. In the 1990s, Tokyo was largely destroyed by a catastrophic event potentially caused by dangerous beings called Youma from another dimension. The story picks up 30 years later, with the city rebuilt and prospering, only for the Youma to return once again. To combat this threat, a special forces team called the Borgman is formed. The team consists of three members - Ryo, Chuck, and Anice. Using advanced battle armor and weaponry powered by Baltector energy, they have the ability to transform and fight the invading Youma. Their leader Ryo rides a sentient, transforming motorcycle into battle. Each member also wields a large cannon that matches the color of their armor - Ryo's is blue, Chuck's is green, and Anice's is pink. In their civilian identities, the three are teachers at a public school. Some of their students are aware of their secret identities as Borgman. The Borgman defend Megalocity from the Youma, who are led by the villain Lord Mesh and seek to take control of Earth for themselves. It's up to this superhero team to stop the Youma invasion and keep the city safe.",
