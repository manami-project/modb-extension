  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a technologically advanced future, Professor Hayashi tries to warn the world of an impending alien invasion from the Planet Devil, but his warnings fall on deaf ears. When insect-like aliens attack, only Hayashi's son Tsutomu and his four loyal cyborg dogs - Queen, Ace, Jack, and Joker - stand in defense of Earth. Transformed into super-powered canines by Hayashi and capable of combining into the spaceship Liner, the courageous dogs and their young master fight back against the alien menace. Through the bonds of friendship and their enhanced abilities, the unlikely heroes overcome skepticism and ridicule to become mankind's best hope of repelling the extraterrestrial threat. This 50-minute, live-action and animated film blends sci-fi action and heartwarming loyalty between a boy and his dogs. With high stakes and memorable characters, it promises an entertaining adventure for audiences of all ages. Part of the 'Toei Manga Festival', it brings to life the imagination of manga creator Hiroshi Sasagawa through vivid animation and a timeless story of bravery in the face of invasion.",
