    "text": "He ading into the heart of Electric Town, a bustling hub known for its electronic wonders, lies an unassuming bookstore called Uma no Hone. Here, a diverse group of manga enthusiasts unite as employees, each with their own quirks and eccentricities. The newbie, Umio, is a timid young man who finds solace in the company of his fellow bookstore workers. As they unpack new releases and shrink-wrap comics, they share laughs, form close bonds, and even develop romantic feelings for one another. Despite their shared love for manga, they can't help but question their own obsessions and ponder their lack of feminine charm. In this coming-of-age comedy, the unique cast of characters navigates the trials and tribulations of working in a manga shop, all while forming lasting relationships and having the time of their lives.",
