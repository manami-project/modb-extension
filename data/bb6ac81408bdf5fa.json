    "text": "For our leading man, a divorced toilet seat designer, life takes a dramatic turn when he is unexpectedly sucked into a toilet and tasked with saving the world. Despite his handsome appearance and penchant for neglecting his fatherly duties, he finds himself transformed into an overweight, unrecognizable hero. Living with his intelligent and athletic daughter, Min-chan, he embarks on a mission to protect both her and the Earth. As he navigates through bizarre allies and enemies, he strives to regain his daughter's trust and prove that he is more than just a \"bad father.\" Prepare for a wild ride filled with humor, sexual innuendo, and slapstick comedy as our unlikely hero fights for the future of the planet and a chance to reconnect with his daughter.",
