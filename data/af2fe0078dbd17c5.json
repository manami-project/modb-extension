    "text": "Kaito Takagi, an ordinary high school student, is stuck in the background, much like an extra in a movie. Every day, he ventures into the dungeons that have mysteriously appeared across Japan, hunting slimes to earn a little extra cash. From a distance, he admires his childhood friend, the queen of their class, and dreams of more. One day, Kaito encounters an unusual golden slime. After defeating it, he discovers an incredibly rare and valuable item - a card capable of summoning mythical beings! With a decision made, he uses the card to summon a stunning warrior maiden of unmatched beauty. As Kaito embarks on this modern battle fantasy, he seizes the opportunity to rise above his mundane life and become the hero he's always dreamed of being.",
