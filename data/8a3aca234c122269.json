    "text": "Yamagata Prefecture welcomes Yukitaka Tsutsui, a talented baseball player who has just moved out of his parents' home in Tokyo to start high school. As he steps into his new apartment, he is greeted by a peculiar, long-haired man who introduces himself as an amnesiac alien. Unbeknownst to the people of Earth, numerous extraterrestrial beings have already infiltrated the planet, each with their own intentions and personalities.\n\nThis self-proclaimed alien is none other than Prince Baka, a renowned genius from the planet Dogra, who is infamous for his mischievous and troublesome nature. As the crown prince of his home world, Prince Baka's antics often involve subjecting others to absurd tests and granting peculiar powers to unsuspecting children, all for his own entertainment. Despite his intellect, his love for causing chaos and discomfort among humans is unparalleled.\n\nAs Yukitaka finds himself in the midst of this intergalactic madness, he must navigate through life with his new, uninvited roommate. The young baseball star will soon learn that the prince's reputation as a cosmic troublemaker is well-deserved, and that his life will never be the same again. Nostalgic anime fans will delight in this clever series that pays homage to classic television shows and video games from their childhood.",
