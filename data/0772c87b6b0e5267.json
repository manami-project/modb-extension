  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the journey of Raust, a healer who is dismissed from his elite party due to his seemingly limited abilities. His former party leader only realizes Raust's true potential after recruiting a new healer. Meanwhile, Raust embarks on a quest to find new allies, and encounters a charming martial artist named Narsena. As it turns out, Raust's secret lies in his ability to excel in close combat, making him a formidable DPS (damage per second) character, rather than just a support. The crux of the story revolves around Raust's hidden talent and the consequences of not revealing it to his former party. Join Raust as he rises through the ranks with his newfound friends, proving that there's more to him than just his basic healing spell.",
