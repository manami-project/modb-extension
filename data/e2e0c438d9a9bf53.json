  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The dark comedy anime centers around Hoozuki, the calm and ruthless aide to King Enma, the ruler of Japanese Hell. Tasked with overseeing Hell's massive bureaucracy and ensuring operations run smoothly across its 272 subdivisions, Hoozuki handles problems with demonic efficiency, from a restless hero itching to fight again to incompetent torture methods of lackluster employees. Though known for his no-nonsense, sadistic approach to management, Hoozuki has surprising hobbies, like fawning over cute creatures and lovingly raising his prized Goldfish Flowers. He also deals with visiting dignitaries from other underworlds, somehow finding time between micromanaging hellish affairs to host infernal diplomats. With familiar faces from East Asian folklore working middle management and referential humor galore, this anachronistic parody follows Hoozuki as he brings new meaning to the phrase \"employer liability.\" His iron will and trusty iron club keep both minions and the Great King Enma in line. Can everyone's favorite bureaucratic demon wrangle Hell's beastly bureaucracy?",
