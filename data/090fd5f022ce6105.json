Yuuya Nomoto, a typical college student, finds himself in the driver's seat of a twisted scheme to kidnap high school girls.

As a Therianthrope, a human fused with animal DNA, Hitomi is a force to be reckoned with, possessing the fearlessness and strength of a honey badger. Now, with his life inextricably linked to Hitomi's success in the Killing Bites, Yuuya must navigate this savage world of high-stakes battles, where the ultimate prize is control over the economy.
