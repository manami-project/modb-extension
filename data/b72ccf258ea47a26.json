    "text": "By the iron grip of the Earth Federation, the colonial planet of Deployer has been held captive, igniting the flames of rebellion among its inhabitants. A sudden coup sees the elected Governor, Denon Cashim, seize dictatorial power with the Federation's endorsement, imposing martial law on the planet. In response, a small but determined guerilla group known as the 'Deployer 7' or 'Fang of the Sun' rises, vowing to fight for their planet's independence.\n\nCrinn Cashim, the Governor's son and a trainee pilot for the Federation's formidable robot weapons, finds himself thrust into battle against the uprising. Upon discovering the truth behind the conflict, Crinn's conscience compels him to join the rebels, forming the core of the Deployer 7. Armed with the powerful Combat Armor, the Dougram, designed by the brilliant Dr. David Samalin, the group stands a fighting chance against the Federation's forces.\n\nAs the battle for Deployer's freedom unfolds, neither side is willing to back down, setting the stage for a grueling conflict that will determine the fate of the planet. With Crinn Cashim at the helm of the Dougram, the Deployer 7 embarks on a daring mission to reclaim their world's independence and liberate it from the Federation's oppressive rule.",
