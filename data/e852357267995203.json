Tragedy struck when an experiment involving the powerful sword, Baltanders, went awry, transforming Azali into the formidable dragon known as Bloody August. Shocked by the elders' indifference and their attempts to conceal the incident, Krilancelo abandoned his magical studies and adopted the name Orphen, vowing to restore Azali's true form.\n\nFive years later, Orphen has established a new life in the bustling city of Totokanta with his apprentice, Majic. Plagued by debt and rivals, Orphen remains undeterred in his quest for the elusive Baltanders sword and the whereabouts of his estranged sister. As fate would have it, Azali's search for the sword leads her to Totokanta, causing chaos and destruction in her wake.\n\nJoined by his newfound ally, Cleao, Orphen must navigate the treacherous path to unlock the secrets of the Baltanders sword, all while evading the wrath of the Tower of Fang elders. With the stakes higher than ever, Orphen's journey to save Azali from her dragon form will test the limits of his courage and determination.",
