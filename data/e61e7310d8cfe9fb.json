    "text": "The anime Fate/Zero Cafe brings a delightful twist to the beloved Fate/Zero series, transforming its characters into charming, super-deformed versions of themselves. In this unique adaptation of the Fate/Zero Cafe manga, the heroic Saber steps into the role of café manager, leading her quirky team in their culinary adventures. The first episode of this special mini movie was showcased in cinemas before the 3D re-screenings of Kara no Kyoukai: Fukan Fuukei, while the second episode premiered at ufotableCINEMA. It's worth noting that Fate/Zero Cafe is exclusively available for viewing at select ufotableCINEMA screenings, with no physical releases available.
