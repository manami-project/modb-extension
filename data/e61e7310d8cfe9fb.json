  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fate/Zero Cafe reimagines the characters from the Fate/Zero anime and light novel in a lighthearted, comedic setting. Specifically, the characters are portrayed as cute, super-deformed versions of themselves who have opened and operate a café together. Leading the staff at the Fate/Zero Café is Saber, who serves as the café's manager. With her leadership and the combined efforts of the other characters from the Fate series, the café promises an entertaining experience for visitors. Much like Carnival Phantasm, which brought a comedic spin to the Fate franchise, Fate/Zero Cafe aims to present the well-known characters from Fate/Zero in silly, unexpected situations as they work together in the food service industry. Though the tone is humorous, the core personalities and relationships between the characters remain intact. Fate/Zero Cafe originated as a manga before being adapted into animated specials and mini episodes. By bringing together the serious Fate/Zero cast for some lighthearted antics, Fate/Zero Cafe provides a fun twist on the popular franchise.",
