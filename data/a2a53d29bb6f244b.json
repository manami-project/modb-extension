    "text": "Fourth Dimension's notorious Baron has set his sights on a priceless angel statue, and it's up to two seemingly ordinary schoolgirls to protect it. By day, Haruka Minazuki and Aoi Kannazuki are dedicated students at St. Cerise Academy, rehearsing diligently for their school festival's stage performance. But when night falls, they transform into the formidable Twin Angels, a crime-fighting duo that has previously vanquished foes like Black Auction.\n\nAs the academy prepares for its 100th festival, a mysterious book vanishes from the school chapel, and a chilling declaration of war arrives from the Baron himself. With the precious statue en route from Italy to their school, the stakes have never been higher for Haruka and Aoi. Guided by the enigmatic Misty Knight, the Twin Angels must rise to the challenge and thwart the Baron's sinister plans. Will they succeed in safeguarding the statue and making the Baron pay for his audacity? Only time will tell, as these brave heroines embark on their most daunting mission yet.",
