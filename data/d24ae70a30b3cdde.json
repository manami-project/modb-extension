  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hero-King Inglis lived a life of loyal service to his country as a divine knight and lord of the realm. On his deathbed, his one unfulfilled wish was to experience life as a frontline warrior rather than a king. By fortune, his wish is granted by the goddess Alistia, who reincarnates Inglis in the far future as the daughter of a noble family. However, Inglis soon discovers an unexpected challenge - in this era, utilizing magic requires runes that she lacks, making her ineligible to become a knight. Undeterred, Inglis views this as an opportunity to prove that knighthood is defined by one's grit on the battlefield rather than by bloodline. She decides to become a squire instead, pushing her limits to master the martial arts and blade, perhaps even becoming an extraordinary squire in the process. With her wish for a second life granted, Inglis now pursues her long-held dream of focusing purely on combat training and skills. Faced with new trials in this familiar yet different world, Inglis remains ambitious to hone her talents to the fullest.",
