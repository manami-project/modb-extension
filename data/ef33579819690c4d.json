    "text": "Harvesters' painting by Pieter Bruegel serves as the inspiration for Miyazaki's short film, screened at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka and Ghibli Park in Nagakute. The film follows the tale of Baba Yaga, a witch residing in a secluded water mill surrounded by a dense forest. Baba Yaga's servant, the Egg Princess, is tasked with performing all the strenuous daily chores around the mill.\n\nOne evening, a large batch of kneaded dough magically comes to life due to the witch's spell. The Egg Princess, now accompanied by her newfound friend, fears the witch and decides to flee. However, the journey ahead is uncertain and filled with unknown challenges. With the enchanting arrangement of Antonio Vivaldi's La Folia by Joe Hisaishi, the story unfolds, leaving the audience wondering what fate awaits the two friends.",
