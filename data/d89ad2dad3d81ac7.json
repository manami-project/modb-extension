  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two friends, Baja and Gar, share joyful times at KOHATA Anime Studio until Baja overhears a conversation about the sea. That night, a mystical comet witch named Coco uses her powers to reveal the mesmerizing blue sea teeming with diverse marine life to Baja. However, a masked sorcerer named Ghee casts a spell, plunging Baja's cherished friend Gar into the ominous depths of a dark sea, claiming that he will expose the true nature of the sea.\n\nThis enchanting tale serves as the inspiration for Kyoto Animation's latest project, featuring their beloved mascot character, Baja. The new anime will be included in a Blu-ray Disc offered to those who pre-order tickets for Kyoto Animation's upcoming fan event, 'We're Here Now!!: It's the First Festival in Two Years,' in collaboration with Animation DO. For those unable to attend, the Blu-ray Disc will also be available for separate purchase at a later date.",
