    "text": "Usagi Tsukino is a clumsy, crybaby eighth grader who lives an ordinary life until she encounters Luna, a talking black cat with a crescent moon mark. Luna gives Usagi the power to transform into Sailor Moon, a magical girl sworn to protect love, justice and an unnamed Moon Princess. As Sailor Moon, Usagi must search for the Legendary Silver Crystal, a powerful artifact wanted by the evil Queen Beryl of the Dark Kingdom. Usagi must also find the other Sailor Guardians who will help her on this mission. Queen Beryl dispatches minions to Usagi's town to acquire the Silver Crystal through devious means. Despite worries about school, family and romance, the newly awakened Sailor Moon must lead the Sailor Guardians against Queen Beryl's dark forces. The fate of the Moon Princess and the world itself depends on whether Usagi and her allies can find the Legendary Silver Crystal in time!",
