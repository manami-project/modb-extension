    "text": "The story centers around a newly opened 20th century museum in town that transports adults back to the nostalgia of their childhood. However, the museum's owners have sinister plans to trap the adults in the past using a project called \"Yesterday Once More.\" After visiting the museum, the adults start behaving strangely, abandoning their children to relive their youth. Protagonist Shinnosuke and his friends realize something is very wrong and set out on a mission to rescue their parents. They must uncover the truth behind the museum's motives and find a way to release the adults from its grasp before the entire world gets sent back in time permanently. It's an imaginative and high-stakes race against the clock full of fun and adventure. With its inventive premise, intergenerational conflict, and plucky young heroes, this anime promises exhilarating action as well as thoughtful exploration of the appeal and dangers of nostalgia. Can Shinnosuke foil the museum owners' master plan and keep the world moving towards the future?",
