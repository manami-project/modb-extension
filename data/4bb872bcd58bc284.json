  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story revolves around Mato Kuroi, a lively and innocent girl who begins her journey in junior high school. On her first day, she is captivated by her classmate Yomi Takanashi, a mature and reserved individual. Despite their contrasting personalities, a deep bond blossoms between the two, leading to a strong friendship. However, as they enter their second year, they are separated into different classes, causing a rift in their relationship.\n\nMeanwhile, in a parallel universe, a young girl known as Black Rock Shooter, with blue flames flickering in her eyes, wields a colossal gun and engages in a fierce battle against another young girl, Dead Master, who carries a jet-black scythe. The connection between these two worlds and the girls within them remains a mystery.\n\nThis anime is inspired by the Vocaloid music video of the same name, sung by Miku Hatsune, and features a unique blend of real-life relationships and supernatural battles.",
