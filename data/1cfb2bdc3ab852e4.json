    "text": "In an alternate version of modern-day Japan, a diverse range of superhumans exist and live alongside regular humans. These superhumans include extraterrestrial Titans, mystical creatures from fantasy realms, ancient ghosts and goblins, cyborgs built by scientists, and sentient relics from past civilizations. Some superhumans openly embrace their powers and fame, while others keep their abilities hidden. To help monitor and assist the superhuman population, the Japanese government has established the Superhuman Bureau. Protagonist Jiro Hitoyoshi works for this special bureau tracking the exploits of superhumans across the nation. Both good and evil superhumans are emerging, leading to a complex societal landscape filled with uncertainty, intrigue and adventure.",
