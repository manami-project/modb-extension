    "text": "After a shift from an all-girls to a co-ed institution, the prestigious Aichi Symbiosis Academy has seen the rise of the \"Supreme Five Swords,\" a formidable group of armed female students tasked with correcting the behavior of troublesome male students. When Nomura Fudou, a rebellious young man, finds himself enrolled in the academy following a massive brawl, he is presented with a stark choice: conform to the school's unique disciplinary methods by dressing and acting like a girl, or face expulsion. As Fudou navigates this perilous environment, he must confront the fierce members of the Supreme Five Swords, each with their own distinct personalities and skills. Will Fudou manage to preserve his dignity and emerge victorious against these battle-hardened girls, or will he succumb to the academy's unconventional methods?",
