    "text": "Leiji Matsumoto's Endless Orbit SSX follows the journey of Captain Harlock and his loyal crew aboard their advanced battleship, as they navigate the galaxy in search of the fabled planet Arcadia. In a future where Earth has fallen under the control of the destructive Illumidas, Harlock and his allies have been branded as pirates and forced to flee their home. As they battle the Illumidas and their human collaborator, a vengeful engineer, Harlock's team is joined by courageous young individuals who share their vision of a peaceful future for humanity. With stunning ship-to-ship combat sequences and quiet moments of introspection, Endless Orbit SSX serves as a loose prequel to Galaxy Express 999 and Space Pirate Captain Harlock, reuniting fans with beloved characters while introducing new faces to the vibrant cast. Join Captain Harlock and his crew as they fight for freedom and search for a new home among the stars.",
