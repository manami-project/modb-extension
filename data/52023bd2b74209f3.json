    "text": "After Japan's economic decline, corrupt politicians continued making shady deals with unscrupulous businessmen to profit off the hard work of regular citizens. Keiichi Suzuki of Oshika Construction bribed politician Seijiro Matsuzaka to approve substandard buildings. However, the independent Government Crime Investigation Agency (GCIA), a legally-empowered organization similar to the FBI, uncovered their scheme. Led by the presumed-dead officer Jotaro Zaizen, GCIA agents who themselves had reasons to take down Suzuki and Matsuzaka began investigating. Suzuki hired the Haoukokuryu-kai yakuza gang to combat the GCIA. But Zaizen possesses unlimited funds and connections through his powerful Zainers Gold Black card, and will utilize any means necessary to defeat injustice. By cracking down on the corrupt relationship between business and political circles, Zaizen and the GCIA aim to stop officials from exploiting their positions and restore fairness.",
