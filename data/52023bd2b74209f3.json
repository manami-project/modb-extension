  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zaizen Jotaro, a resilient investigator thought to be long gone, reemerges to challenge the corrupt alliance between unscrupulous politicians and greedy businessmen in post-bubble burst Japan. As the head of Oshika Construction, Keiichi Suzuki, and the parliament member, Seijiro Matsuzaka, exploit the system for personal gain, Jotaro steps in to dismantle their illicit operations.\n\nEquipped with the enigmatic Zainers Gold Black card, Jotaro wields unlimited resources, powerful connections, and a touch of fortune to fight against government corruption. As the lead agent of the Government Crime Investigation Agency (GCIA), Japan's independently-run counterpart to the FBI, he assembles a team of individuals with personal vendettas against Suzuki and Matsuzaka.\n\nIn response, Suzuki enlists the aid of the Haoukokuryu-kai, a formidable yakuza group, to thwart Jotaro's efforts. Based on Ken Kitashiba and Yasuhiro Watanabe's political intrigue detective manga, this anime delves into the high-stakes battle between justice and corruption, where Jotaro will stop at nothing to bring down those who abuse their power.",
