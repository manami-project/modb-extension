  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akari, a soft-spoken high school student, finds solace in the thrill of travel, a passion she inherited from her older sister who filled the void left by their frequently absent parents. Her classmate, Nagi, an ever-cheerful and adventurous spirit, is drawn to Akari's enigmatic aura, leading them to embark on a journey across Japan.\n\nDuring their first summer vacation, the duo heads to Kyoto, each with their own unique travel style. While Akari is eager to reach their destination, Nagi savors every sight, determined to create a treasure trove of memories. As Akari reluctantly follows Nagi's leisurely pace, she begins to appreciate the joy found in the journey itself, rather than just the destination.\n\nTheir adventure unfolds in 'Tabi Hani', a crowdfunded anime project that captures the essence of traveling through Japan. The first episode, 'Kyoto-hen', premiered at UPLINK Kyoto in April 2023, with two more episodes currently in the planning stages. Join Akari and Nagi as they traverse the beautiful landscapes of Japan, discovering not just new places, but also themselves.",
