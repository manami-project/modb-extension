  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Springâ€”birds are singing, frogs are dancing, and a mother bear in a cave tells her children to play outside, but with a warning: beware of the terrifying humans. As the bear brothers engage in sumo wrestling and enjoy honey, a hunter attempts to shoot them. The two brothers, who have never seen a human before, make their way back to their mother's cave, captivated by the human's ability to walk upright. Their mother bear teaches them to stand and walk like humans. As summer turns to autumn, the bears practice and master the art of walking upright. When the mountain animals see the bears walking like humans, they mistake them for people and flee. The bear brothers stand triumphantly, until a real hunter appears. The animals run for their lives, but the bear brothers attempt to fight back, imitating the humans. Realizing they cannot win, they crawl under trees and jump over valleys on all fours to escape with their lives.",
