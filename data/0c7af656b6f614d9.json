  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Reuniting for an unconventional alliance, Lupin, the cunning thief, and his long-time pursuer, Inspector Zenigata, join forces to dismantle a nefarious arms dealing organization, Shot Shell. After Zenigata's reassignment from the Lupin case, both men find themselves on a collision course with the lethal assassin, Keith Hayden, who has been tasked with eliminating Lupin and his crew.\n\nIn a daring heist, Lupin and his associates - the skilled marksman Jigen, the stoic swordsman Goemon, and the enigmatic Fujiko - steal a cutting-edge Russian submarine and kidnap a brilliant scientist, Karen Korinsky. With Karen's expertise, they infiltrate Shot Shell, aiming to expose their illicit activities and restore Zenigata's position. As they navigate treacherous waters, the group must stay one step ahead of Keith, who is hot on their trail and determined to take them down.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, Lupin and his gang must rely on their wits, camaraderie, and an arsenal of stolen technology to achieve their goals: unmask Shot Shell, reclaim Zenigata's rightful place, and, most importantly, survive the deadly game they've found themselves in.",
