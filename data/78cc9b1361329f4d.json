  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This avant-garde anime is a graduate school project that explores the concept of aleatoricism, or chance, in artistic creation. Created in 2015 by Saori Suzuki while studying animation at the Tokyo University of the Arts, it takes the form of an abstract moving image game in which viewers are challenged to find emerging shapes and pictures in the aleatory visuals. With a musical score by Miki Sakurai and sound design by Tomoya Matsuura, the animation aims to showcase the myriad creative potentials that can emerge when image-making is freed from intent and left open to random generation. As the synopses suggest, there are many more possibilities at play here than the director herself realized in her school project. By embracing aleatoricism as an artistic technique, this anime promises a novel viewing experience in which meaning and imagination arise spontaneously from the unpredictable interplay of shapes, motion and sound. Those with an experimental spirit or interest in the avant-garde may find this a fascinating demonstration of how order can organically emerge from chaos.",
