    "text": "Only one thing could possibly drive a wedge between the inseparable Lupin, Jigen, and Goemon: a priceless, legendary dragon statue that lies in the depths of the Atlantic, nestled within the wreckage of the Titanic. This artifact is not only the key to unlocking the secret behind Goemon's indestructible Zantetsuken sword, but it is also a cherished heirloom of his clan. When a ruthless Hong Kong gangster enlists Lupin and Jigen to obtain the statue, the duo finds themselves in a high-stakes race against time, pursued by both the relentless mafia and Goemon, who is determined to protect the dragon statue at any cost, even if it means turning against his closest allies. As the trio navigates the treacherous waters of friendship and betrayal, they embark on an international adventure that takes them from the bustling streets of Tokyo to the enchanting city of Paris, all the while grappling with the question: is the bond of friendship truly unbreakable?",
