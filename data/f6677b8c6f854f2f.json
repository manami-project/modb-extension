    "text": "Godly Fifteen racers and a chance at a grand prize of 100 million yen. Among these hopefuls is Kanata Rivington, a 19-year-old half-Japanese driver who has recently returned to Japan after graduating from a prestigious racing school in England. Kanata's true motivation for returning to Japan, however, is to find his missing father, Ken Katagiri. To do so, he takes on his father's last name and enters the MFG circuit, hoping to catch his father's attention by competing in the high-profile races that are broadcast on television. Despite the challenges of racing with an outdated combustion engine car in a world dominated by electric vehicles, Kanata's exceptional driving skills allow him to rise through the ranks and become a formidable competitor. Will he be able to achieve his goals and find his father in the process?",
