To avoid this dire fate, they must successfully orchestrate the academy's annual parade, a celebration steeped in tradition and magic.

As the parade day approaches, the young witches must harness their magical abilities and work together to create an unforgettable event that not only secures their place in the academy but also redefines the world's perception of witchcraft. Prepare for a magical extravaganza as Akko and her friends embark on a thrilling journey to make their Enchanted Parade a resounding success!",
