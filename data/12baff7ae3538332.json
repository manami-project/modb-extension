  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Henkei Shoujo follows the stories of young girls who possess the incredible ability to transform into machines. Whenever a girl with long, dark hair wearing a summer dress encounters trouble, one of the Henkei Shoujo springs into action to help. In one story, a gust of wind blows a woman's hat away. A high school girl races to catch it, leaping into the air. Rather than fall back down, her body transforms into a fighter jet which rockets away. With this sudden burst of speed, she is able to retrieve the escaping hat. The shorts showcase these girls using their stunning transformation powers in mundane situations. Though the troubles are trivial, the Henkei Shoujo gladly turn into mechas to lend a hand. Their mechanical alternate forms allow them to pull off unbelievable feats with ease. Through these lighthearted tales, viewers are introduced to the wonderful coexistence between humans and Henkei Shoujo.",
