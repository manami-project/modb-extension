  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime introduces the Henkei Shoujo, a group of ordinary girls with an extraordinary ability to transform into powerful machines. In one instance, a young woman witnesses this unique phenomenon when her hat is swept away by the wind. A high school girl, Haru, dashes after it and, upon nearly losing her grip, morphs into a fighter jet to chase it down. The Henkei Shoujo are always ready to lend a hand, transforming into mechas to aid those in need. However, their assistance is exclusive to young girls of a similar age, with long, dark hair, and donning a white summer dress. This intriguing series offers a fresh take on the everyday lives of these remarkable girls, blending the mundane with the extraordinary.",
