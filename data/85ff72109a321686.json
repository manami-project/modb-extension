  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Due to the revolutionary technology known as 'Mana,' humanity has reached an era of unparalleled peace and prosperity, free from war, famine, and pollution. In this utopia, Angelise Ikaruga Misurugi, the first princess of the prestigious Misurugi Empire, is beloved by her people and poised to take the throne. However, her world crumbles when she discovers she is a 'Norma' â€“ an individual who cannot wield Mana and is considered an outcast in society.\n\nStripped of her royal status and exiled to a remote island, Ange, as she is now known, finds herself in the company of fellow Norma women who spend their days battling dragons from another dimension using humanoid robotic weapons called 'Paramail.' In this harsh new reality, Ange must adapt to a life of combat and learn what it means to believe in herself and trust others. As she fights against the dragons and the prejudices of society, Ange embarks on a journey to reclaim her identity and uncover the hidden truth about the world she once knew.",
