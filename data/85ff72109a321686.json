Stripped of her title and rights, Angelise is exiled to a remote island occupied by Norma women forced into military conscription. There she joins the Norma in piloting giant robots called 'Para-mails' to fight off invading DRAGONs - mysterious and destructive beasts from another dimension. Once an innocent princess, Angelise must now find the strength and purpose to survive in her harsh new reality.
