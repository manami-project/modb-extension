  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Randolph, a retired Marine Lieutenant, turns to theater to inspire those who, like him, have suffered at the hands of pirates, using his ship as a floating stage for his troupe's performances. As the curtain prepares to rise on his final production before retirement, chaos ensues when several actors quit unexpectedly. Enter the Straw Hat Pirates, who, after purchasing tickets for the show, find themselves thrust into the roles of the missing performers. Their unconventional acting skills turn the first act into a comedic spectacle, but the real drama unfolds when Randolph is arrested by the Marines for alleged illegal dealings with pirates. The commander orchestrating the arrest is none other than Governor, a former subordinate of Randolph's, who seeks revenge against his former superior. With Randolph's last performance hanging in the balance, Luffy and his crew must navigate this unexpected plot twist, proving not all pirates are villainous and ensuring that Randolph's farewell performance goes on as planned.",
