  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The renowned Randolph troupe, led by ex-Marine Lieutenant Randolph, has traveled aboard their ship putting on plays that give courage to those affected by pirates. But Randolph is retiring, and his farewell performance is threatened when three actors quit just before curtain. Seeking to help, the Straw Hat Pirates take the actors' places, though their bumbling hijinks nearly ruin the first act. Further chaos erupts when Randolph is falsely arrested by his vengeful former subordinate, Navy Commander Governor, who aims to exact revenge. With Randolph and his final performance now in jeopardy, Luffy and his crew must rescue the troupe leader, protect the ship and show Randolph that not all pirates are villains. Through this ordeal, bonds are forged and perceptions changed while carrying out Randolphâ€™s mission - proving the show must go on.",
