  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Saien Temple, the home of apprentice Buddhist priest Ikkou Satonaka, is buzzing with the arrival of a new girl, Kazusano Kazuki. As Ikkou continues his journey towards becoming a monk, he finds himself in increasingly awkward situations with the nuns-in-training, thanks to Kazuki's presence. The story takes an intriguing turn as Ikkou's mystical holy powers begin to unfold, powers that are intertwined with his earthly desires. While the nuns at his temple strive to suppress these powers, Kazuki, hailing from a rival temple, has a contrasting mission: to awaken Ikkou's powers, no matter the cost. As the second season of \"Ah! My Buddha!!\" unfolds, Ikkou's spiritual journey becomes more complex, filled with unexpected challenges and a dash of humor.",
