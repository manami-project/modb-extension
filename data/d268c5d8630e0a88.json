  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ikkou Satonaka is an apprentice Buddhist priest continuing his training at his grandmother's Saien Temple. Living alongside him are six nuns-in-training. Ikkou possesses mysterious holy powers that unexpectedly awaken when he encounters earthly pleasures and desires. This frequently leads to awkward and embarrassing situations with the nuns. In the second season, a new nun named Kazuki Kazusano joins the temple. Kazuki hails from a rival temple with differing beliefs about Ikkou's powers. Unlike the Saien nuns who try to suppress Ikkou's powers to protect their modesty, Kazuki believes his abilities should be nurtured at any cost. She makes it her personal mission to intentionally awaken Ikkou's powers, even if it means scandalous exposure. With the provocative Kazuki now in his midst, Ikkou finds himself in even more humiliating and risqu√© circumstances with the nuns-in-training.",
