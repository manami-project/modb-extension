Great Mazinger, Grendizer, and the Getter Robo G team form a Super Robot Army to thwart the prehistoric beast's path of destruction towards Tokyo. With the fate of their comrade, Boss Borot, hanging in the balance, the combined might of these mechanical heroes may be the only hope for Japan's salvation.
