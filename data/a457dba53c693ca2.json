    "text": "Bungou Stray Dogs follows the journey of Atsushi Nakajima, an orphan who finds himself on the brink of starvation after being expelled from his orphanage. He encounters two peculiar individuals, Dazai Osamu, a suicidal man attempting to drown himself, and Kunikida Doppo, a bespectacled man nervously flipping through a notepad. Both are members of the 'Armed Detective Agency,' a unique organization that tackles cases too dangerous for the police and military. Atsushi joins them in their mission to eliminate a man-eating tiger that has been terrorizing the population.\n\nIn the heart of Yokohama, individuals known as 'literary masters' possess extraordinary abilities inspired by their namesakes. Atsushi, Dazai, and Kunikida are among these gifted individuals, using their powers to solve mysteries and engage in battles against other 'literary masters.' The series combines action, mystery, and supernatural elements, creating an engaging narrative that revolves around the unique abilities of its characters and their dynamic interactions. As Atsushi navigates this new world, he discovers the true potential of his powers and the impact they have on the people around him.",
