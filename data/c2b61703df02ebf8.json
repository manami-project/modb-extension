  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 1995, Earth is conquered by the alien Akron army from the Saar Cluster, reducing cities to rubble and turning many like Kento into war orphans. Hiding in a cave to escape danger, Kento and his friends discover a secret base belonging to Dr. Earl - an escapee from the Akron's other conquest, planet Helios. Here lies dormant Earl's powerful robot Daltanious, which awakens when combined with the lion bot Belarios. Earl reveals Kento descends from Helios royalty. Now, alongside his comrades Danji and Belarios, Kento must master piloting Daltanious to free Earth from the Akron's clutches. Training is arduous, with new threats emerging regularly. Yet the bonds between this diverse crew strengthen each day. Together, they just might reclaim their planet - and forge an even brighter future.",
