  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The year is 1995, and Earth has fallen under the ruthless rule of the Akron, an alien army hailing from the Saar Cluster. In the aftermath of the invasion, cities lie in ruins, and the remaining survivors are forced to eke out a living in desolate shanty towns. Among them is Kento, a war orphan who, along with his friends, seeks refuge in a cave to evade marauding bandits.\n\nStumbling upon a hidden base within the cave, Kento and his friends discover the secret sanctuary of Dr. Earl, a refugee from the conquered planet Helios. Within the base lies a marvel of Helian technology: Daltanius, a powerful robot that gains strength when combined with the intelligent lion robot, Beralios.\n\nAs fate would have it, Kento is revealed to be a descendant of the ancient Helian royal line, making him the chosen one to pilot Daltanius. Alongside his friend Danji Hiragi, Kento must now take up the mantle of Earth's protector and lead the resistance against the oppressive Akron forces, all while uncovering the truth about his own heritage and its connection to the war.",
