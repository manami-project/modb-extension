    "text": "Robinson, a transcendent being, hands over a small book called NOTE to Hajime Ichinose, a vibrant 16-year-old with a penchant for stationery, catapulting her into the clandestine world of the Gatchaman. These legendary warriors, armed with reinforced suits powered by the spiritual energy of living beings, are tasked with safeguarding Tachikawa City, a bustling metropolis on the outskirts of Tokyo, from alien threats. Among these threats is MESS, a sinister entity wreaking havoc and destruction. As the newest member of the Gatchaman crew, Hajime teams up with seasoned fighters like Sugane Tachibana and Jou Hibiki, under the guidance of Paiman, their panda-like alien leader. Together, they must combat the escalating menace of MESS, all while maintaining their anonymity and juggling their everyday lives. As they navigate this delicate balance, they also discover that they are not the only heroes in this world, with the advent of Galax, a social media app that empowers ordinary people to lend their unique skills in times of crisis. Amidst these challenges, the Gatchaman crew, bolstered by their new recruit, must stand united to thwart the looming threat of Berg Katze, an enigmatic alien bent on plunging the world into chaos and destruction.",
