    "text": "Star student Haruka Nogizaka, admired for her beauty, intelligence, and affluence, is the epitome of perfection at the elite Hakujo Academy. Her classmates, captivated by her grace, bestow her with affectionate French nicknames, such as 'Nuit Étoile' and 'Lumière du Clavier.' Unbeknownst to them, however, Haruka harbors a secret passion for anime, manga, and otaku culture – a revelation that could shatter her pristine image.\n\nAverage student Yuuto Ayase, who has the fortune of sharing a classroom with the esteemed Haruka, finds himself inadvertently uncovering her hidden hobby during a library visit. Instead of exposing her, Yuuto vows to protect Haruka's secret, forging an unexpected bond between them. As they grow closer, Yuuto helps Haruka navigate her secretive otaku lifestyle, while grappling with his own burgeoning feelings for her.\n\nMeanwhile, their unique friendship becomes a hot topic among their classmates, who can't help but gossip about the unlikely pairing of the school's most popular girl and the unremarkable boy. Despite the whispers, Yuuto and Haruka continue to nurture their connection, learning valuable lessons about acceptance, friendship, and love along the way.",
