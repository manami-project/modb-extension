  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Stranded late one night, Haruo finds himself seeking shelter, with Akira by his side, leading him to ask his mother for assistance. In an unexpected turn of events, Hidaka pays a visit to Haruo's residence, bringing along her PlayStation console as a token of friendship. These events unfold in the aftermath of the first season, with the three OVA episodes serving as a continuation, effectively functioning as episodes 13 to 15.\n\nFour years have passed since their initial encounter, and the bond between Haruo Yaguchi, Akira Oono, and Koharu Hidaka remains unshaken. However, new challenges arise as Akira's teacher, Gouda Moemi, adopts a stern demeanor, and Hidaka grapples with her burgeoning feelings for Haruo. Despite his occasional lack of composure and introspection, Haruo possesses an enduring passion that fuels his every action - his unwavering love for video games.",
