    "text": "Sanrioâ€™s adorable characters have a special place in Kouta Hasegawa's heart, particularly Pompompurin, the golden retriever. However, the high schooler has been concealing his affection, fearing the judgment of his peers. His life takes a dramatic turn when he crosses paths with four fellow students who share his love for Sanrio characters. Among them are the charismatic Yuu Mizuno, soccer team member Shunsuke Yoshino, library assistant Ryou Nishimiya, and student council president Seiichirou Minamoto. Together, they embark on a journey of self-acceptance and camaraderie, aiming to create a play for the cultural festival that celebrates their shared passion for all things Sanrio. As Kouta embraces his love for Pompompurin, his ordinary high school life transforms into a sparkling adventure filled with new friendships and unforgettable experiences.",
