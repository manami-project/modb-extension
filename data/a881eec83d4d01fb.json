    "text": "The story is set in the Kingdom of Liberl, a small nation that has managed to remain independent despite invasion attempts from the mighty Erebonian Empire. Liberl is rebuilding from the devastation of the last war with the help of the Bracer's Guild, an organization devoted to protecting peace. The main characters are Estelle and Joshua Bright, adopted siblings training to join the Bracers. When their father Cassius Bright's airship goes missing, they set out on a rescue mission and get caught up in a sinister plot. A decade earlier, Cassius led the counterattack that repelled Erebonian invaders. Now, dark forces connected to Ouroboros, an enigmatic organization, threaten Liberl once more. As Estelle and Joshua journey across Liberl with allies from the Bracers Guild, they uncover a conspiracy that shakes the kingdom to its foundations. Together, these brave youths must use all their strength and wits to protect their homeland from impending calamity. Their coming-of-age tale is set against the backdrop of a looming clash between great powers that will determine Liberl's fate.",
