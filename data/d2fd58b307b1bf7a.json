    "text": "Tonikaku Kawaii follows the sweet love story of Nasa Yuzaki and Tsukasa Tsukuyomi. After impulsively getting married soon after they first met, the newlyweds are now enjoying marital bliss two years later. However, their domestic tranquility is disrupted when their apartment catches fire, forcing them to temporarily move into a bathhouse. As Nasa spends more time with Tsukasa, he realizes how little he knows about her mysterious past, including not even meeting her parents yet. Even after all they have endured, Tsukasa remains tight-lipped about her background. Nasa grapples with doubts over whether Tsukasa will fully open up to enable a transparent future together. Nevertheless, Nasa remains devoted to his wife. The two find new ways to bond, like adopting a cat, going to an amusement park, and watching a romantic comedy featuring Nasa’s former teacher. Their tender love continues to grow. While beloved by those around them, Nasa still seeks to uncover more about Tsukasa’s history. As they make wedding plans, he hopes learning about his spouse’s past will only strengthen their fairy-tale romance destined by fate.",
