Unbeknownst to him, Kouichi carries the legacy of an ancient alien race responsible for constructing the Tower of Babel. As the reincarnation of a powerful extraterrestrial, Kouichi must now embrace his destiny as Earth's guardian.\n\nJoined by an extraordinary trio of allies - Ropros, a formidable dragon; Roden, a versatile shape-shifter often disguised as a black panther; and Poseidon, a mysterious robot from the ocean depths - Kouichi faces the daunting task of battling a sinister cult leader, Yomi. With world domination as his ultimate goal, Yomi's malevolent forces threaten the very existence of humanity.\n\nAs the war for Earth's survival intensifies, Kouichi must harness his latent psychic abilities and unite with his super-powered companions to thwart their nefarious foes. In this high-stakes conflict, the fate of the world hinges on the courage and determination of this unlikely hero and his monstrous allies. Will they triumph against the forces of evil, or will Earth succumb to darkness?",
