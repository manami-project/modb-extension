    "text": "Stampede's past, Gasback, resurfaces in a town surrounded by quicksand after two decades. Gasback holds a grudge against the town's mayor and plans to cause chaos. The mayor, in response, hires numerous bounty hunters, including a beautiful woman seeking revenge from Gasback. However, Gasback's bodyguard, Wolfwood, stands in her way. Meanwhile, Vash the Stampede, who inadvertently set off the chain of events twenty years ago, finds himself in the middle of the chaos. The legendary thief's return also attracts insurance agents Meryl and Milly, who are in for a shock. As the situation escalates, Vash teams up with Amelia Ann McFly, Wolfwood, and the insurance agents to thwart Gasback's plans.",
