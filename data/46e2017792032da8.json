  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The talented young tennis players of Seigaku Academy's boys tennis team embark on a day-long training expedition to a mountain tennis resort. Expecting to hone their skills with specialized practice, they instead find their reserved courts overtaken by a group of arrogant college tennis players. Refusing to be deterred, hotshot freshman Ryoma Echizen takes matters into his own hands and boldly challenges the rude university students to a high-stakes match. If Ryoma wins, his team gets the courts back. But if he loses, the exhausting day of hiking and intense training under the threat of team manager Sadaharu Inui's formidable \"Inui Juice\" will have been for nothing. With indomitable spirit and skill well beyond his years, young Ryoma fights with passion and determination to reclaim the courts for his Seigaku teammates. Win or lose, one thing's for certain - Ryoma Echizen won't back down from a challenge.",
