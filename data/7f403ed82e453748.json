  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Texhnolyze takes place in an underground city called Lux that has fallen into despair and violence. Three main factions vie for control - Organo, a group with ties to the criminal underworld that controls the prosthetics business; the Salvation Union, a populist group seeking to disrupt Organo; and Racan, a gang of young people with enhanced abilities from prosthetics. The story follows Ichise, an orphan and prize fighter who loses an arm and a leg in a fight. On the verge of death, he is found by Dr. Eriko Kamata, who gives him experimental prosthetic limbs called “Texhnolyze.” With his powerful new appendages, Ichise gets drawn into the escalating battle for control of Lux. He crosses paths with the mysterious Ran, a girl who can foresee possible futures. Together, they realize Lux is on the brink of war and collapse. As violence and chaos consume the city, Ichise struggles to uncover the truth about Lux’s existence and his own destiny within it. Though his actions may actually catalyze the city's demise, he rages against humanity's downfall.",
