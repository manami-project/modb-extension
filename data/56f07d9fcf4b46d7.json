  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lunar colonization became the solution to Earth's 21st-century crisis of overpopulation and dwindling resources. The Moon's abundant minerals revitalized Earth, fostering prosperity. However, this progress came at a steep price for the lunar settlers, who faced harsh living conditions and oppression under the Earth Federal Government and its Monopolice force.\n\nShun Nonomura, a lunar colonist, unwittingly stumbles upon a powerful weapon that could potentially overthrow the Monopolice and secure freedom for the colonists. This weapon becomes the centerpiece of a burgeoning resistance movement, which rallies around the enigmatic alien monument known as Dallos.\n\nAs tensions between the lunar colonists and Earth's government escalate, acts of rebellion become more frequent. The discovery of Dallos, which holds the potential to change the course of lunar history, could be the key to the colonists' liberation.\n\nDallos, created by Studio Pierrot in 1983, stands as the world's first Original Video Animation (OVA) series. It also marks the directorial debut of Mamoru Oshii, who would later become renowned for his work on Angel's Egg, the first two Urusei Yatsura movies, and Ghost in the Shell.",
