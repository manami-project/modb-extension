  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The popular anime series Gintama centers around a comedic trio known as Yorozuya, comprised of eccentric leader Gintoki, straight-man Shinpachi, and feisty Kagura. The anime is known for its oddball humor, parodies, and meta-referential gags poking fun at anime tropes. One such meta-gag revolves around reused animation - specifically a New Year's scene of the trio sitting around a kotatsu snacking on tangerines. In these scenes, Shinpachi breaks the fourth wall to complain about the repeated footage as Gintoki and Kagura engage in silly banter. Gintoki typically ends the bits with an absurd non sequitur announcement. The latest DVD release, Gintama: Shinyaku Benizakura-hen, contains one such reused animation vignette as a special feature. Fans of the show's tongue-in-cheek style of comedy will likely appreciate this self-referential extra poking fun at common anime shortcuts. Those new to the offbeat charms of Gintama may find these gags confusing, but oddly amusing nonetheless.",
