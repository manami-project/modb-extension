    "text": "New synopsis:\n\nGet ready for a hilarious ride with the limited edition DVD release of Gintama: Shinyaku Benizakura-hen, available from December 15th, as announced by Tsutaya Online. The DVD comes with an exclusive new special, adding to the excitement. In this anime, the Yorozuya trio can be seen lounging around a kotatsu, munching on tangerines, and engaging in elaborate discussions during New Year's celebrations. Shinpachi, a member of the group, voices his frustration about the animation staff reusing footage, while Gin-chan never fails to conclude the running gag with a nonsensical announcement. This anime promises to bring laughter and entertainment to your screens.",
