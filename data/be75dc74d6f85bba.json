  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wato, a local priest's daughter, finds herself in an unusual relationship with Hosuke Sharaku, a boy who is the last descendant of a powerful three-eyed civilization that once ruled the world with their advanced technology and knowledge. Sharaku is a sweet, innocent child when his third eye is covered with a bandage, but once it's uncovered, he becomes a force to be reckoned with, wielding supernatural powers and ancient wisdom.\n\nThe third eye on Sharaku's forehead unleashes his true nature, transforming him into a formidable sorcerer capable of summoning demons and wielding a red harpoon wand known as Red Condor. With his third eye open, Sharaku is driven by a desire to conquer mankind, a far cry from the clueless child he is when his third eye is sealed.\n\nAs the evil Sharaku, he is in love with Wato and acts as her protector, but when his third eye is covered, their roles reverse, and Wato becomes his guardian and caretaker. Based on the manga by Tezuka Osamu, this animated series takes viewers on an exciting adventure as Sharaku navigates ancient mysteries with his psychic powers and ancient wisdom, while also exploring the complex relationship between Sharaku and Wato.",
