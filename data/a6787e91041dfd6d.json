    "text": "Well, in the bustling city of Japoness, Otaru's life at the Kasahari Apartments is anything but ordinary. Sharing his home with not one, but seven marionettes — Lime, Cherry, Bloodberry, Tiger, Luchs, Panther, and the enigmatic Marine — Otaru's days are filled with laughter, learning, and the occasional chaos. Equipped with the maiden circuit, these marionettes possess the ability to experience human emotions, making for a lively and unpredictable household.\n\nAs the marionettes undergo etiquette training to better understand the nuances of human life, a mysterious new threat looms over Japoness city. The once hostile Sabre Dolls — Tiger, Luchs, and Panther — are now part of Otaru's household, while Marine, discovered by Lime in the mountains, harbors a deep-seated fear of men and a past shrouded in mystery.\n\nAs the marionettes navigate the complexities of everyday life, they must also confront the growing interest in Marine's awakening from both another country and the enigmatic Faust. Can Otaru and his marionettes protect Terra II from impending danger while balancing their newfound domestic bliss? Only time will tell in this heartwarming and thrilling adventure.",
