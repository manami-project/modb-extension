  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nagi Umino and Erika Amano were switched at birth and grew up in different families. When they were 16 years old, they both learned of the hospital mix-up. On the day they were set to meet their biological parents, Nagi and Erika coincidentally crossed paths. Erika asked Nagi to pretend to be her boyfriend to avoid an arranged marriage set up by her parents. However, they soon discovered that their biological parents were one and the same - and those parents still wanted them to marry to make up for the past hospital mistake! Though neither Nagi nor Erika wanted to get married, their parents remained insistent. So the teenagers started living together while trying to secretly rebel against the engagement. Nagi fell in love with his classmate Hiro and hoped to date them instead. Meanwhile, Erika aimed to resist her father's control over her future. Despite being engaged, Nagi and Erika agreed not to become romantically involved. Their chaotic lives became further complicated by the marriage arranged by their well-meaning but overbearing parents.",
