    "text": "When a man takes a bite from an apple and tosses it into the water, he is shocked to find his own reflection staring back at him with the head of a fish. But this isn't the only strange occurrence happening in the water. As he gazes into the rippling pond, he is greeted by a myriad of illusory aquatic creatures that appear and vanish in the sky reflected on the water's surface. The man finds himself in the midst of a surreal and mystifying world where the line between reality and illusion blurs. This anime promises a unique and captivating exploration of the bizarre and fantastical.",
