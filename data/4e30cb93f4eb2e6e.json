    "text": "Nano is a popular teacher who commands respect from her students, except for one troublemaker named Souji. During a matchmaking session arranged by her father's friend, Nano meets a pleasant man she believes to be Souichirou. As they spend more time together and gradually open up, he proposes marriage. Caught up in the moment, they become intimate. However, Nano later discovers his true identity - her problematic student, Souji! Souji confesses that he had impersonated his brother Souichirou to get close to Nano. Despite rejecting the idea of an improper relationship with a student, Nano finds herself drawn to Souji's persistent romantic pursuit. She struggles between her duties as a teacher and her awakened desires as a woman. Will the upright Nano give in to Souji's forceful charm offensive or firmly reject his taboo love?",
