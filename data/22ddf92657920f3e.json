    "text": "Amelie's strict student council finds itself with a new member: Iruma Suzuki, a human disguised as a demon. Iruma, who had previously found joy and camaraderie among his demon classmates, is now thrust into a world of rules and order. Despite the challenges, Iruma remains determined to climb the ranks in this demonic realm. However, his plans hit a snag when his club is disbanded, leaving him with no choice but to join the student council.\n\nAs Iruma struggles to adapt to the council's rigid ways, he also grapples with a mysterious talking ring that disapproves of his magic use. Meanwhile, Amelie, the council's cold-hearted president and Iruma's friend, undergoes a drastic personality change, threatening the council's reputation.\n\nWith the school on the brink of chaos, Iruma must navigate these new challenges, save the student council, and continue his quest to rise through the demonic hierarchy. Will he succeed in this chaotic, demonic life at school? Only time will tell.",
