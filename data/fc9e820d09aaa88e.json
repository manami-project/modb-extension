  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yumi is a young school girl who loves flowers and drawing comics. Her parents own a flower shop that she helps out in. One day, after Yumi saves a dandelion from being picked, two flower fairies named Kakimaru and Keshimaru appear before her. They explain that they give magical tools to children who care for flowers. Seeing Yumi's devotion to flowers, they grant her a magic wand and a pendant. With the wand, Yumi can draw anything in the air and it will materialize temporarily. However, the pendant signals when there are only 30 seconds left before her creations disappear. Though well-intentioned, Yumi's rash personality causes her magic to frequently make trouble. She must keep her powers a secret and learn to use them responsibly while navigating typical challenges of school, family, and relationships. Yumi's flower fairy gifts promise entertaining adventures as she figures out how to conjure solutions to life's problems without undesirable consequences. This magic girl story encourages appreciation of nature's beauty and the power of creativity.",
