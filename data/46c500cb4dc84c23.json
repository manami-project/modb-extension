  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lupin III sets his sights on his grandfather's legendary treasure, said to be worth several trillion dollars. The only clue to its location lies in Napoleon's dictionary, which has resurfaced as the prize in a historic car race from Madrid to Paris. Lupin enters the high-stakes competition, facing off against intelligence agencies from around the world who also seek the riches. With his partners Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko by his side, Lupin races to win Napoleon's dictionary and unlock the secret to his family's treasure before his ruthless competitors. Though Inspector Zenigata trails him as always, even greater dangers await on the road. Through clever schemes and death-defying stunts, Lupin pursues his rightful inheritance in this thrill-packed adventure across Europe. More than money, the treasure represents his family legacy - but claiming it won't be easy with the G7 powers and their operatives on his tail.",
