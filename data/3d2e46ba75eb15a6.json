    "text": "Straw Hat Pirates, led by Luffy, embark on a thrilling journey to a mythical sky island, guided by a descendant of the infamous Noland the Liar. As they brave a wild ride to the heavens, they discover a fantastical country hidden among the clouds: Skypiea, a city of gold. However, the crew's adventure is far from smooth sailing as they find themselves entangled in a conflict between winged clans and a self-proclaimed deity who wields immense power. Only Luffy stands resilient against this formidable adversary, holding the key to unraveling the island's enigmatic past. This reimagined TV special, part of the 'Episode of' series, offers a fresh perspective on the Skypiea arc, introducing a character previously unseen in the original anime.",
