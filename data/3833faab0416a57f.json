  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kazuomi's cluelessness about love and Rio's eagerness to seize any opportunity with a cute girl form an interesting contrast with Yuna and Akari's differing perspectives on romance. As the four of them navigate the complexities of love and friendship, they discover that their relationships are not as straightforward as they thought. Yuna, a hopeless romantic, finds herself drawn to Rio, who bears a striking resemblance to her childhood prince, while Akari, a pragmatic realist, develops feelings for Kazuomi, Yuna's carefree childhood friend. However, the path to love is never easy, and the group must confront their own insecurities and secrets before they can find the happiness they seek. Will they be able to overcome their differences and find the love they desire, or will their contrasting views on romance ultimately tear them apart? Only time will tell in this heartwarming tale of youth, friendship, and love.",
