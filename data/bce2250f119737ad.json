  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lingalind, a land encircled by a divine wall, is a place where the inhabitants believe that life outside the barrier is impossible. The wall is revered as a deity, bestowing enigmatic capsules known as Rakuho, which contain food, weapons, and metallic armbands that transform the wearer into powerful mechanical beings called Briheights. The land is divided into two major powers, the Supremacy of Lutoh and the Republic of Rekka, who engage in relentless battles to secure the Rakuho and bolster their military strength.\n\nIn a distant village called Edger, a young man named Back Arrow emerges from a Rakuho with no recollection of his past, except for the knowledge that he hails from beyond the wall. In pursuit of his lost memories, Back Arrow embarks on a perilous journey that leads him to cross paths with the two dominant forces, ultimately becoming entangled in their ongoing conflicts. Along the way, he encounters the formidable Briheight armor, setting the stage for a series of epic battles that could potentially shatter the very foundation of Lingalind's beliefs.",
