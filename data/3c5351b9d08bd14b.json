  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Much like humans, androids have become an integral part of society in a not-so-distant future Japan. Despite their human-like appearance, they are treated as mere appliances due to the Robot Ethical Committee's guidelines. However, some humans, known as dori-kei, have developed an unusual affinity for these androids, leading to new societal issues.\n\nRikuo, a high school student, has always viewed androids as nothing more than useful tools. But when he stumbles upon peculiar entries in his home android Sammy's activity log, his perspective begins to shift. Accompanied by his friend Masaki, Rikuo traces Sammy's footsteps to a peculiar café called Eve no Jikan, where androids and humans are treated as equals. As Rikuo interacts with the café's patrons and uncovers more about Sammy's behavior, he starts to question the societal norms surrounding androids and begins to view them as friends rather than tools.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ethics Committee is working on implementing policies to limit the involvement of androids in society, adding another layer of complexity to the evolving relationship between humans and androids. The movie version of this story provides a comprehensive look at the narrative, including all the OVAs and new scenes that delve deeper into the backgrounds of various characters.",
