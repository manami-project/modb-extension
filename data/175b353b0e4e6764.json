    "text": "With the malevolent priest Dark Fact vanquished and the realm of Esteria liberated, seasoned adventurer Adol Christin embarks on a new journey alongside two celestial goddesses. Their destination: the ethereal, suspended land of Ys, a once-thriving civilization now plagued by an insidious evil that has left its inhabitants bereft of hope. As the sole successor to the formidable powers of the ancient priests, Adol is entrusted with the daunting task of unveiling the truth about their world to the people of Ys. However, as Adol's strength and influence continue to burgeon, the question arises: will he prove to be the salvation that Ys so desperately needs, or will he inadvertently become the harbinger of its doom?",
