    "text": "This anime centers around Higashino Ji, a teenager with a deep passion for racing cars. He lives for the thrill of speeding down roads in fancy sports vehicles. Through his involvement in the racing scene, Higashino forms meaningful friendships and gains a greater appreciation for life. Initially directionless, Higashino possesses raw talent for racing but lacks purpose beyond the adrenaline rush. However, as he dedicates himself to continuously improving his skills, he develops a nuanced understanding of racing's deeper meanings. Simultaneously, by bonding with fellow racers, he cultivates reliability and community. Gradually, Higashino transforms from an ambitious boy into a mature, multidimensional racer - one powered not only by talent, but by the personal growth earned through perseverance, perspective and camaraderie. Ultimately, this is an uplifting narrative of someone discovering themselves through a sport they love.",
