  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takazaki Yuusuke, an ordinary 11th-grader at the secluded Kanenone Academy, an all-boys school nestled deep in the mountains, is about to experience a dramatic shift in his mundane life. In an effort to transition the school into a co-ed institution, the administration invites a group of girls from a nearby school to stay for a trial period. The boys, who have had limited interaction with the opposite sex, are thrilled and anxious about the impending 'female invasion.'\n\nAs the bus carrying the girls arrives, a peculiar girl named Midori Chitose leaps off and immediately embraces a bewildered Yuusuke, leaving him and his mischievous roommates, known as the Baka Trio, utterly confused. As the boys navigate this new, hormone-charged environment, Yuusuke finds himself the center of Midori's undivided attention, leaving him uncertain about her true intentions and their shared past.\n\nPrepare for a wild ride filled with awkward encounters, comedic misunderstandings, and unexpected revelations as these two worlds collide in this hilarious and heartwarming tale of adolescence.",
