  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nino is a young girl with a passion for singing, which stems from a childhood promise she made with her first love, Momo, and a boy named Yuzu who composed music. After two sudden, painful goodbyes in her childhood, Nino made individual promises with Momo and Yuzu that if they ever separated, her voice would guide them back together. Six years later, destiny brings high school-aged Nino, Momo, and Yuzu to the same school. However, much has changed over the years - while Nino holds onto hope of fulfilling her promise, Yuzu's old feelings for her resurface and Momo seems disinterested in reconnecting. As Nino relentlessly pursues the goal of mending their broken friendship through the power of music, complicated feelings arise involving the three childhood friends. It remains to be seen whether music can overcome heartbreak and lead to the fulfillment of a long-held promise.",
