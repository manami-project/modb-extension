  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2075, humanity has expanded beyond Earth, colonizing the moon and developing commercial space travel and corporations. However, the increased activity in space has also led to a growing problem - dangerous debris orbiting the Earth. Ai Tanabe joins Technora Corporation's unappreciated and under-resourced Debris Section, dedicated to removing this hazardous space junk. There she meets a cast of eccentric characters, including chief clerk Philippe Myers, mysterious temp worker Edelgard Rivera, and passionate Hachirota Hoshino, who dreams of having his own spaceship one day. Though the work is unglamorous, Ai perseveres, hopeful to make space safer while getting to know her new colleagues. Planetes tells the untold stories of everyday people living and working amongst the stars, who keep space clean and safe for mankindâ€™s future. Though born on Earth, their hopes and dreams reach far beyond it.",
