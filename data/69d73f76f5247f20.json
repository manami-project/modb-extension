    "text": "Philippe Myers, a good-natured chief clerk, leads an underappreciated team in 2075, a time when space travel has become a mundane reality. The team, known as the Debris Section of Technora Corporation, is tasked with the crucial yet overlooked mission of collecting hazardous space debris that threatens to damage spacecraft and equipment. Among the team is Hachirota 'Hachimaki' Hoshino, an impassioned EVA worker with dreams of owning his own spaceship, and Ai Tanabe, a newcomer with a fascination for the cosmos. Despite the team's poor funding, understaffing, and the mockery they face from the rest of Technora, they persevere in their mission to keep space safe for mankind's ever-expanding exploration and commercialization. Join this diverse group of individuals as they navigate the challenges of their job, the vastness of space, and their own personal aspirations in the award-winning sci-fi series, Planetes.",
