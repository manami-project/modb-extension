    "text": "Etrama Di Raizel, the Noblesse, and Muzaka, the lord of werewolves, find themselves entangled in a tragic destiny that unfolds over 820 years before the events of Noblesse. The human world is plagued by ambition, greed, and endless wars, with other races watching from the sidelines. When a young girl named Ashleen becomes an orphan due to one such war, Muzaka rescues her and abandons his duties as lord to ensure her happiness. However, his compassion for humans enrages some of his own kind, leading them to instigate more wars and establish a secret organization within the human realm to manipulate Muzaka.\n\nAs Muzaka's rage towards humans intensifies, the Noblesse must intervene to prevent further destruction. Amidst the chaos, the werewolf Maduk schemes, causing a rift between Muzaka and Raizel, forcing them to engage in a desperate battle against each other. Ultimately, this tragic history culminates in Raizel's indefinite slumber, setting the stage for the events of Noblesse. Can the Noblesse awaken from his sleep to restore peace and stop Muzaka's wrath?",
