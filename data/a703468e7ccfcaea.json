    "text": "Kimura's \"Deathtic 4\" explores a zombie-filled world where a living frog falls from the sky, and a young zombie boy and his friends embark on a mission to return it to its own world. In Fukuyama's \"Doorbell,\" a man must outrun alternate versions of himself to maintain control over his life. Futamura's \"Limit Cycle\" delves into the life of a man trapped in a never-ending cycle of work, while Yuasa's \"Happy Machine\" follows an infant who discovers the world outside his fake nursery, filled with alien-like creatures. Finally, Watanabe's \"Baby Blue\" tells the story of two young students who embark on a one-day adventure, cherishing their time together.\n\nGenius Party is a collection of seven unique and captivating animated short films from Studio 4Â°C.
