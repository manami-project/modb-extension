  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Uruno is a wolf who considers himself useless and unworthy. While wandering in search of a new home, he stumbles upon a forest inhabited by a peculiar community of animals who fail to embody the traits typically associated with their species. After a hostile initial encounter, Uruno engages in a physical altercation with Usahara, an uncharacteristically aggressive and tobacco-addicted rabbit. Although he first resolves to move on from the strange forest, his plans are thwarted when he meets Chiiko, an endearingly clumsy cheetah. Smitten at first sight, Uruno decides to remain in the forest in the hopes of someday winning over Chiiko's affection. However, earning the cheetah's love while cohabiting with the forest's eccentric residents proves challenging. The motley crew include Yunihiko, a sake-loving unicorn; Takaoka, a severely near-sighted eagle; Kumanee, an enterprising bear who peddles goods; and Peganosuke, a painfully shy pegasus. Although exasperated by their antics, Uruno holds out hope that despite considering himself good-for-nothing, he can find both love and belonging amongst these lovable misfits.",
