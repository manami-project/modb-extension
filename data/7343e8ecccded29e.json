Despite Nagi's initial reluctance, the two form a formidable partnership, vowing to conquer the football world together. Their journey takes a significant turn when they receive an invitation to participate in the prestigious Blue Lock project, funded by the Japanese Football Association.

As Nagi delves deeper into the world of soccer, his life transforms from monotonous to exhilarating, and his potential to become the best striker in the world becomes more tangible.
