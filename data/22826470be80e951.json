As the world grapples with disasters of unimaginable proportions and a complex web of crime, the government establishes a new lifeline - the mobile emergency police, Hyper Rescue.\n\nHyper Rescue's secret weapon?

As suitable candidates, Gou and his peers join forces with Hyper Rescue and other adults, racing against time to safeguard humanity's peace and security.\n\nBut when the enigmatic Terra, an android controlled by a malevolent AI, launches an assault on the Mobile Rescue Police, the stakes are raised.

Will Gou and his teammates succeed in protecting what truly matters? Join them in their thrilling, high-stakes rescue missions to find out!",
