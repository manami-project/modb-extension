After a vicious assault, she awakens to find a lethal poison-laced collar fastened around her neck, accompanied by chilling instructions seemingly originating from the terrorists plaguing her city.\n\nAs the situation escalates and the clock ticks down, five enigmatic figures emerge, each with a mysterious connection to the unfolding events. All former police officers, they claim to possess vital knowledge about the sinister forces threatening Shinjuku and its citizens.\n\nWith her life hanging in the balance and the fate of her city at stake, Ichika must navigate a web of trust and deception. Can these strangers be the allies she needs, or will they lead her further into danger? Only time will tell if Ichika can unravel the truth and save Shinjuku from the edge of destruction.",
