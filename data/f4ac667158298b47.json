  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In March 1992, the anime studio Gainax began planning a sequel film to their earlier work, Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise. Titled Aoki Uru (Blue Uru), the new film would be set 50 years after the original and follow a group of fighter pilots, similar to the 1988 OVA. However, production ceased in July 1993 due to financial difficulties, as a feature film was beyond Gainax's budget at the time. In 2013, Gainax announced plans to finally produce Aoki Uru, with The Wings of Honneamise veterans Hiroyuki Yamaga as director and screenwriter and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto as character designer. The film would move forward without the involvement of famed Gainax co-founder Hideaki Anno. Over the following years, production of Aoki Uru shifted between various Gainax subsidiaries and partners, targeting release dates in 2018 and 2022. However, as of late 2022, Yamaga was still described as working on the long-in-development project. So while the Aoki Uru sequel has been stuck in development hell for decades, Gainax and its related studios have continued their efforts to produce this follow-up to a beloved 1980s anime classic. With Yamaga still actively working on the film after 30 years, fans continue to hold out hope that they may someday get to see the further adventures of Honneamise's fighter pilots.",
