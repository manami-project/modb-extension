  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gaina studio, a subsidiary of Kinoshita Group, is currently working on the production of \"Aoki Uru,\" an anime movie that was initially conceived by Gainax in March 1992. This film serves as a sequel to the renowned \"Royal Space Force: The Wings of Honneamise,\" taking place half a century later. The narrative centers around a group of fighter pilots, reminiscent of the anime \"Oritsu.\"\n\nRegrettably, the project was initially halted in July 1993 due to Gainax's financial constraints, as the studio was struggling to stay afloat with many of its core businesses either shutting down or generating minimal revenue. However, at the 2013 Tokyo Anime Fair, Gainax announced the resumption of the project, with Hiroyuki Yamaga and Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, veterans of \"Honneamise,\" taking on the roles of director, screenwriter, and character designer, respectively. Notably, Hideaki Anno is not involved in this endeavor.\n\nIn 2018, Gaina studio took over the production of \"Aoki Uru,\" aiming for a worldwide premiere in 2022. Despite the delay, director Yamaga is reportedly still diligently working on the project. As a prelude, a short film titled \"Overture,\" produced by Uru in Blue LLP based in Singapore, was pre-streamed globally in Spring 2015.",
