  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Alchemy, a seemingly mundane crafting skill, becomes the unexpected key to an extraordinary life for Takumi Iruma, an ordinary boy accidentally summoned to a fantastical world. In a twist of fate, a goddess offers him a single skill of his choice as compensation for the mix-up. Desiring a tranquil life devoid of battles, Takumi chooses alchemy, only to discover its unparalleled power to create everything from sacred swords to soaring ships. This newfound \"cheat skill\" propels him to unimaginable wealth as a merchant and invincibility in combat, setting the stage for an endearing adventure of the (perhaps) most formidable alchemist in this otherworldly realm.",
