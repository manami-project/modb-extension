By day, she runs a detective agency that specializes in supernatural cases, and by night, she becomes a formidable Dream Warrior, battling evil demons that invade people's dreams and threaten to steal their life force. With her trusty pets, Alpha and Beta, who transform into a fierce tiger and wolf, Rem embarks on thrilling adventures to protect humanity from the sinister forces lurking in their dreams.
