  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rem is an ordinary woman living a double life. By day, she runs a detective agency specializing in supernatural cases. By night in the dream world, she becomes a warrior defending humanity from demons invading dreams. When the dream demons reach the waking world, Rem fights them aided by her two pets Alpha and Beta, who transform into a tiger and wolf to battle by her side. Though originally conceived as more risqu√©, the story evolved into one focused on Rem's heroics and fights against evil without sexual content. Overall, this anime centers on Rem striving to protect both dreaming and waking worlds from demonic forces. With fierce pets and weapons, she takes on her duty as a guardian of dreams and vanquisher of nightmare creatures. Though outwardly ordinary, she leads a secret, action-packed life full of supernatural conflict.",
