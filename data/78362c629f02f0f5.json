  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ookiku Furikabutte is an anime about a high school baseball team aiming to compete in summer tournaments. The story focuses on the relationships between teammates as they strive towards their goal. An unaired 12.5 episode will be included in the 7th DVD and Blu-ray volume release. The director created this special episode to cover manga content that they were unable to fit into the original TV series between episodes 12 and 13. One storyline involves Kurata, a player from an opposing Bijou team. Initially willing to injure others at the behest of his coach Roka, Kurata experiences guilt after aggressively harming Abe. Seeing the damage inflicted strikes a moral chord in Kurata, leading him to reject Roka's underhanded methods going forward. This additional episode and Kurata's redemption arc further develop characters and events as the team perseveres through hard-fought matches on their quest for tournament triumph.",
