  "synopsis": {
    "text": "20XX. Yuki is struggling with deciding on a career path and finding a job, uncertain of what he wants to do or be. His classmate Michiru aspires to become a journalist and has steadily progressed in her goals, recently being selected for a coverage opportunity on a local island. She asks Yuki to assist her with the task, but he is reluctant. The island, envisioned as a \"smart city\", integrates advanced technology and nature to provide comfort and safety for its residents. As Yuki interacts with the passionate people working on the island, Michiru's words begin to change his perspective. This anime depicts a technologically advanced sustainable community as well as the aimless anxiety felt by many youths regarding their future career. The cryptic title reflects both the challenge of succinctly describing a multifaceted corporation like Kyocera as well as job seekers frustrated when asked to describe themselves in one word during interviews. Ultimately, connecting with the island residents and Michiru's resolute spirit helps provide direction to Yuki's uncertainty.",
