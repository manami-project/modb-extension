    "text": "Fumi is an assistant at a popular hair salon, working under the strict guidance of Sousuke, the charismatic head stylist, as she pursues her dream of becoming a hairdresser. Though initially aggravated by his touch, Fumi comes to realize her true feelings when she stands in as Sousuke's practice partner after hours. As he runs his fingers through her hair and caresses her skin, Fumi recognizes her attraction. Sensing her arousal, Sousuke begins to intimately explore Fumi's body, smiling wickedly as she surrenders herself to his touch.",
