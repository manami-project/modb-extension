  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sousuke, a charismatic hairdresser and manager of a popular salon, takes Fumi under his wing as an assistant. Fumi dreams of becoming a hairdresser herself, but every time Sousuke touches her, she becomes agitated. After the salon closes one day, Fumi becomes Sousuke's practice partner at the shampoo station. As he touches her and sprinkles her with water, she realizes that her agitation may not be anger, but attraction. Sousuke, sensing Fumi's feelings, begins to explore every corner of her body with his fingertips, leaving Fumi unable to resist him. The TV version of the anime will premiere on April 6, 2020, while the complete version will stream on the ComicFesta Anime Zone website.",
