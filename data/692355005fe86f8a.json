    "text": "Maya is a 13-year-old girl with a passion for acting who works in a crowded restaurant to support her bitter, unstable mother. When legendary actress Chigusa Tsukikage discovers Maya's incredible talent, she offers to mentor Maya and open doors to a bright future in theatre. At the same time, Maya's rival Ayumi Himekawa, blessed with wealthy parents and connections, yearns to be recognized for her own skills instead of her privilege. Both girls set their sights on landing the iconic role of The Crimson Goddess, a part created by Chigusa herself. To prove themselves worthy, Maya and Ayumi must push themselves to conquer intense acting challenges that test not just their talent but their dedication and endurance. As the competition brings out the best and worst in each girl, only one can ultimately inherit Chigusa's coveted role. Maya must navigate ruthless schemes from Chigusa's enemies, self-doubt, and her disadvantage of inexperience. But fueled by her friends' support and love of acting, Maya fights to develop her skills to rival the unbelievably gifted Ayumi. More than just a role, The Crimson Goddess represents Maya's lifelong passion and dream in the face of adversity.",
