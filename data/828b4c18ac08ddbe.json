    "text": "Things are about to get chaotic as the spirit Toyako Hermit emerges from Gintoki's enigmatic wooden sword, ready to impart an ultimate technique to Gintoki and his companions in this exclusive Gintama episode. Originally previewed at Jump Special Anime Festa 2014 and later bundled with the limited edition of the 58th manga volume, this special anime installment sees the Yorozuya members in for more than they bargained for. As Tae's powerful move escalates beyond expectations, the characters can't help but disregard the fourth wall. It's time for the Yorozuya members to awaken once more and embark on this wild adventure.",
