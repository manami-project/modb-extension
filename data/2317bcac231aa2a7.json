  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akira Nikaido, an ordinary high school student with a laid-back attitude, finds his mundane life taking a dramatic turn when he encounters the enigmatic Shirogane. Initially dismissing Shirogane's cryptic warnings about a shared destiny, Akira soon finds himself face-to-face with a shadow monster while retrieving a forgotten item at school. Shirogane reveals the unsettling truth: the equilibrium between the human and shadow realms is in peril, and Akira must transform into a 'shin' - a shadow creature - to restore harmony. As Akira navigates his new role as a shadow partner to the affectionate Shirogane, he must juggle fending off supernatural threats, managing Shirogane's advances, and maintaining his academic life. This anime introduces shonen-ai elements not present in the original manga, adding a unique twist to the narrative.",
