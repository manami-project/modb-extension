  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akira Nikaido is a typical high school slacker, living an ordinary life until he encounters the enigmatic Shirogane. Shirogane informs Akira that he has an important destiny and convinces him to meet later that night at school. There, Akira gets attacked by a shadow monster, making him realize the truth in Shirogane's claims. Shirogane explains that the balance between the human world and shadow world has become distorted. He says Akira must transform into a \"shin\" - a being from the shadow world - to aid in restoring harmony between the realms. Though initially skeptical, Akira agrees to partner with the affectionate Shirogane to defeat invading shadow creatures called Kokuchi. Together, they set out to hunt Kokuchi while Akira struggles to balance his new supernatural responsibilities with typical high school life.",
