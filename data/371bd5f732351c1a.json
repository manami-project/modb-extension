  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cedie, a young American boy, finds his life turned upside down when he becomes the unexpected heir to a British earldom following his father's untimely death. Leaving New York behind, Cedie moves to England to live in his ancestral castle under the watchful eye of his grandfather, the Earl of Dorincourt. The Earl, initially intending to mold Cedie into a traditional aristocrat, is met with resistance from Cedie's middle-class mother, who eventually joins her son in England. However, as time passes, Cedie's innocent love and artless simplicity begin to thaw the Earl's stubborn and selfish heart, teaching him valuable lessons in compassion and social justice. Based on the beloved novel 'Little Lord Fauntleroy' by F.H. Burnett, this heartwarming tale follows Cedie's journey as he unknowingly transforms his grandfather from a cold and distant figure into a caring and generous person.",
