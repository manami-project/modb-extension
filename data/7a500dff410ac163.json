  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Beyond the deceptive facade of her dilapidated apartment complex, Rin, a reserved university student, encounters a chilling reality that defies the tranquil promises of the rental brochure. The eerie atmosphere permeating the building is only the beginning of her ordeal, as she finds herself surrounded by peculiar neighbors and gruesome occurrences.\n\nAs the ominous presence in her apartment intensifies, Rin's anxiety escalates, leaving her feeling constantly observed by unseen eyes. The neighborhood offers no respite, with whispers of a serial killer, bizarre cults, and enigmatic strangers adding to her growing dread.\n\nDelving into the library's archives, Rin unearths disturbing connections between local folklore, grotesque creatures, and her own haunted residence. With the assistance of a sympathetic library staff member and a young shaman, she uncovers the existence of 'spirit bugs' - sinister entities that have long been shrouded in secrecy.\n\nAs Rin confronts these otherworldly horrors, she must also face her own buried past, which may hold the key to her survival. In this nightmarish world, Rin's only hope is to unravel the terrifying truth hidden within herself and her new home.",
