  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now enter the world of Battle Royal High School, where ordinary student Hyoudou Riki dons a tiger mask for kung-fu battles, fitting right in with the school's eccentricities. Little does Riki know, his mundane life takes a dramatic turn as he shares an uncanny resemblance with Byoudo, the Master of the Dark Realm. When a dimensional gate unexpectedly opens, the two worlds collide, and chaos ensues.\n\nAs the malevolent Fairy Master manipulates Byoudo into attempting to conquer our world, Riki finds himself semi-possessed by his dark counterpart. The classmates he once knew are now grotesque, lustful monsters, and the situation worsens as a zealous exorcist and the heroic Zankan of the Space-Time Police are drawn to the inter-dimensional pandemonium.\n\nRiki's life becomes a battle for survival as he faces rival demons, demon hunter samurai, and interplanetary police forces, transforming the once-normal school into a war zone. The stakes are high, and Riki must confront the evil forces threatening his world, as failure means losing not just his life, but everything he holds dear.",
