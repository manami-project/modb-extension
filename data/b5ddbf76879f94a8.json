  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Vampires, indistinguishable from humans, walk among the unsuspecting populace of Tokyo. These creatures, capable of suppressing their bloodlust, can transform into monstrous beasts when provoked or consumed by desire. To maintain order and protect the secret of their existence, a clandestine police unit employs the help of half-vampire officers, like Yuuki Anzai, who believes his human side grants him resistance to his kind's primal urges.\n\nCollege student Tsukasa Taira's life takes a dramatic turn when she stumbles upon the hidden world of vampires. After narrowly escaping an attack by a bloodthirsty classmate, Anzai swoops in to save her. As he continues to safeguard Tsukasa, an inexplicable bond forms between them, challenging Anzai's steadfast rule of abstaining from human blood.\n\nAs their lives become increasingly intertwined, Tsukasa and Anzai must navigate the complexities of their unique relationship. With Anzai's vampiric instincts threatening to consume him, can he resist the temptation and protect the woman he's grown to love? Join them in a thrilling journey that explores love, loyalty, and the constant battle between human and monster.",
