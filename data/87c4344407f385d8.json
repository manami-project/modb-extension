    "text": "When Team 7 takes on what seems like a routine escort mission, they soon find themselves caught in a battle to protect the Hidden Waterfall Village from invasion. Upon arriving in the village with their charge Shibuki, the cowardly leader, Naruto, Sasuke and Sakura discover the village under attack. The invading ninja force is led by a man named Suien, intent on capturing the village's secret treasure - the Hero's Water, a special elixir granting whoever drinks it a sudden boost in chakra. Suien and his men take villagers hostage, forcing Shibuki to consider surrendering the potion. With their teacher Kakashi called away on another mission, the young genin realize it falls to them to defend the Hidden Waterfall. Spurred on by Naruto's bravery and will to never give up, Shibuki finds his courage and resolve to protect his people. Team 7 prepares to fight and outwit their enemies with all their skills, not only to complete their mission, but to prove what it really means to be a hero.",
