  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jean and Rico, elite agents of the Social Welfare Agency, are not your average girls. Once human, they are now cybernetically enhanced warriors, rebuilt by the government to be lethal assassins. Triela, the oldest among them, is a fierce hunter who stops at nothing to eliminate her targets. Opposing her is Pinocchio, a ruthless assassin raised by the FRF, a terrorist organization at war with the SWA. Once human, these shattered souls have become murderous machines, driven by a brutal desire to be the last one standing.\n\nAfter a successful mission, Jean and Rico take a break with José and Henrietta, visiting their old home. Jean is flooded with memories of their younger sister, Enrica, who tragically lost her life in a terrorist attack. As they navigate their past, Jean grapples with the lingering spirit of Enrica and the budding relationship between José and Henrietta.",
