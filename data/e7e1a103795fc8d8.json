  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Hero Club at Sakuragaoka High School narrowly avoids being disbanded and is given a new mission by the student council. They are tasked with traveling to a distant lodge that is being taken care of by a guardian. When they arrive, the club members are surprised to find that the guardian has a very familiar face. As the caretaker shows Mizuki and the other heroines around, Mizuki reflects on how adventurous her high school experience has become since joining the club. She has grown accustomed to the excitement that comes with being in the Hero Club. Though the details of their mission are unclear, it's likely another opportunity for the club to help others in need while strengthening their friendships.",
