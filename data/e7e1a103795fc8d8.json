    "text": "Unaired and packed with action, the Hero Club embarks on their most challenging adventure yet in this 12th episode, included in the fourth home video release! Tasked by the student council, our heroes journey to a far-off temple—or rather, a lodge—to aid the guardian—or more accurately, the caretaker—with his responsibilities. As they set forth on their quest, Mizuki can't help but notice how comfortable she's grown with her thrilling high school life, filled with heroic deeds and camaraderie. But who could have predicted that the guardian they're destined to meet would bear such a striking resemblance to someone they already know? Join the Hero Club as they dive into this unexpected and heartwarming escapade!",
