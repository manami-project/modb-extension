  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When ominous alien structures called \"Pillars\" suddenly appear on Earth, humanity is threatened with extinction. In humanity's darkest hour, a self-proclaimed god named Odin comes to their aid. He grants young women supernatural powers and special fighter planes called \"Herocrafts\", allowing them to become \"Valkyries\" - battle maidens who can fight the Pillars. Years later, the war still rages on. Three Japanese Valkyries confront the Pillars surrounding Mount Fuji. Though skilled, each has personal issues. An ace pilot named Claudia arrives from Europe to join them. Nicknamed \"Grim Reaper\" for being the lone survivor on every doomed mission, Claudia expects to be shunned. However, her eccentric new wingmates have no intention of ostracizing her. As the prophesied final battle, Ragnar√∂k, draws nearer, humanity's fate hangs in the balance. Now is the time for the Valkyries to unleash their full power against the Pillars and determine the future of the human race.",
