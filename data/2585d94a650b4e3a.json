  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Minami Kawashima, a second-year high school student, steps up to become the manager of the baseball team at Hodokubo High School in Tokyo when her close friend Yuuki Miyata is hospitalized. Though Minami is eager to fill this role, she has no prior experience in baseball team management. During a visit to a bookstore in search of a team management guide, she accidentally purchases \"Management: Tasks, Responsibilities, Practices\", a classic business text by acclaimed management expert Peter Drucker. Undeterred by her mix-up, Minami forges ahead, using Drucker's teachings on productivity, leadership, and organization to rally the Hodokubo baseball team. Despite the unorthodox source material, she discovers effective ways to administer the team and lift their spirits. With Minami's motivating guidance rooted in sound management principles, the team progresses steadily towards their goal of playing in the national baseball championships.",
