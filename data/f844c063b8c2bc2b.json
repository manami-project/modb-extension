  "synopsis": {
    "text": "His name is Sadamitsu, a former delinquent and leader of the Corpse Gang, who finds himself in an unexpected turn of events when he stumbles upon a battle between an alien and a space robot. Inadvertently damaging the robot, Sadamitsu takes on the responsibility of continuing its mission to protect Earth from 20 million galactic criminals on the loose. With the robot's head, now named Junk, serving as his helmet, Sadamitsu transforms into a powerful fighter, ready to take on the invaders. However, the arrival of a formidable enforcer known as the Vulture makes his task even more challenging. As he navigates his new role as a masked hero, Sadamitsu must also deal with a rocky relationship with a strong female protagonist and find assistance from other possibly-mechanical creatures to save the planet.",
