  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Centuries ago, Kanna, the last surviving member of a winged race, was held prisoner in a castle, feared by the outside world. There she met and fell in love with Ryuuya, a soldier who attempted to fulfill her wish to see the outside world and find her mother, but his efforts failed. Kanna was cursed with eternal agony and sealed in the sky through magic. Hundreds of years later, Yukito, a descendant of Ryuuya, arrives in a quiet seaside town hoping to make money during their annual summer festival. He meets Misuzu, an unusual local girl who reminds him of his mother’s words: “If you find the winged girl’s reincarnation on your travels, use your power to free her.” As Yukito and Misuzu grow close and begin to fall for each other, he realizes she is connected to Kanna's past. Yukito must choose whether to leave town or try to break the centuries-old curse binding Kanna, which causes Misuzu great pain as well. Their intertwining fates over one summer will lead to discoveries of love and loss, while exploring the bonds that tie us across lifetimes.",
