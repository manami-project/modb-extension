    "text": "Yonosuke Hikura is an ordinary high school student who has inherited an extraordinary destiny - protecting the harmony between Heaven and Earth. This vital role has been passed down through generations of his family. When demons escape from the Earth World into the human realm, it falls to Yonosuke to send them back where they belong. He is aided in this monumental task by two allies: the magical sword Chitentai, and Tsukinojo Inbe, a Protector dispatched to Yonosuke by the High Priests of Earth. Together, they courageously confront the demonic forces. Though Yonosuke lives the life of a normal teenager, destiny calls on him to master Chitentai's power and battle the supernatural - preserving the cosmic balance and safeguarding humanity.",
