    "text": "One day, Toki Mishiba, Nobuto Nakajou, and Kazuo Saitou - three strangers with contrasting personalities and backgrounds - receive an invitation to participate in a high-stakes game known as the Bus Game. Intrigued by the promise of a large sum of money, they accept the offer and form a team called 'No Name.' To win, they must outsmart and outmaneuver other teams in a battle to secure a disk containing valuable corporate secrets. As the trio navigates the dangerous world of the Bus Game, they must put aside their differences and work together, even when their lives are on the line. With each member driven by their own personal motivations and secrets, they must overcome their mistrust and form a strong bond if they hope to emerge victorious and claim the ultimate prize.",
