    "text": "Later episodes contain all-new stories that continue the tale of Aoi and her ambition to overcome her fears and achieve her dreams. In the latest season of Encouragement of Climb, Aoi Yukimura is once again bitten by the mountaineering bug. As she reflects on her past adventures, she's invited by the lively Koharu Senjuin to check out the Mountaineering Club. Although initially hesitant to join the competitive club, Aoi finds herself questioning her motivations for climbing mountains in the first place. With the support of her friends, including the energetic Kuraue Hinata, Aoi sets her sights on their next big challenge: a second ascent of Mt. Fuji. Together, they embark on new adventures and conquer new summits throughout Japan's stunning mountain ranges, all while Aoi continues to pursue her passion at her own pace. Fans of the franchise will enjoy a selection of compilation episodes that reintroduce beloved characters and moments from previous seasons, while newcomers can join Aoi and her friends on their inspiring journey to reach new heights.",
