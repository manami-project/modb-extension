While Aoi enjoys the club activities, she prefers climbing at her own pace rather than the competitive focus favored by some other members. As Aoi progresses to high school, she continues pursuing mountaineering with her group of friends, including the spirited Hinata Kuraue. Together they train for their next big goal - conquering Mount Fuji for the second time. Their adventures take them through mountain ranges across Japan, where they face various challenges. However, with the support of friends who share her passion, Aoi persists in overcoming her fears in order to achieve her mountaineering dreams. This latest installment of the Encouragement of Climb franchise features both recap episodes reintroducing beloved characters and moments, as well as new stories continuing Aoi's personal growth through mountaineering. By embracing her hobby wholeheartedly, she aspires to new heights, both literally and figuratively.",
