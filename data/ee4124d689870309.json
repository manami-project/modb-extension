  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a distant frozen future, the planet La Metalle faces extinction as its artificial sun is dying. Queen La Andromeda, desperate to save her people, decides they must undergo a mechanization process - transforming their bodies into machines in order to survive the extreme cold. However, her daughters Maetel and Emeraldas strongly oppose losing their humanity. As the situation grows dire, the queen forces her subjects to mechanization against their will. A scientist named Hardgear drives the process, aiming to rule a world populated only by soulless machines. Maetel and Emeraldas become determined to fight back, willing to risk their lives to stay human and resist Hardgear's rise to power. Though young, the courageous princesses stand as the last bastion of hope for La Metalle to retain any shred of humanity amidst its frozen wastes. Will Maetel and Emeraldas succeed in keeping human compassion alive on La Metalle? Or is cold, mechanized subjugation at the hands of Hardgear the only future left for the planet and its people?",
