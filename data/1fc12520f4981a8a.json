  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is the tale of a princess who, unlike the traditional Sleeping Beauty, embarks on a journey to unravel a hidden truth instead of succumbing to a mystical slumber. Born to a King and Queen who had longed for a child, her arrival was marred by a curse cast by a one-legged man, disguised as a witch, prophesying her death on her sixteenth birthday by a spinning wheel. As she turns fifteen, the princess stumbles upon her mother's old diary, revealing a deep-seated secret: the man who cursed her was once her mother's beloved. Driven by curiosity, she ventures into the forest to meet this enigmatic figure, and in his eyes, she sees the reflection of her mother's past love. This captivating anime, a unique blend of Japanese and Czechoslovakian animation, was created by a Japanese director in collaboration with the renowned Jir√≠ Trnka Studio, known for its pioneering work in stop-motion animation during the 1940s-60s. The film, presented in Japanese, offers a realistic twist to the classic fairy tale, reminding us that 'happily ever after' may not always be as we imagine.",
