As the couple faces the impending reality of graduation, Sakuta's younger sister, Kaede, is gradually rediscovering the world outside her home. Just as she begins to regain her confidence, Kaede reveals her most daring aspiration yet - to attend the same high school as her brother.\n\nUnderstanding the enormity of Kaede's decision, Sakuta is determined to support her, but he can't help but question if this is truly what she desires or if it's the best path for her. Based on the 8th and 9th light novel volumes from the Seishun Buta Yarou series, this heartwarming tale follows the journey of Sakuta and Kaede as they navigate the challenges and complexities of high school life and the pursuit of their dreams.",
