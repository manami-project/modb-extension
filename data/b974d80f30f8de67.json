  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Flandre has mysteriously gone missing within a creepy mansion, leaving Reiri, Riza, Hiro, and Hime without their supernatural powers. After exposing an illusion, they realize they are trapped in a nightmare. Now powerless, they must band together and face dangerous opponents from their past in order to escape, including a werewolf spectre, a giant shark, and a headless horseman stalking the corridors. Meanwhile, Hiro recalls his past after his parents died - he and his sister Sawawa lived apart until she became caretaker of this very mansion. When Hiro came to visit, he met the mansion's new resident, Hime. After pushing her out of harm's way and losing his life, Hime, revealed as a monster kingdom princess, revived Hiro as her servant. Bound to Hime after his selfless act, Hiro now follows the chainsaw-wielding Hime as she wages war against the vampires, zombies, and werewolves that plague her. Though originally intending good, Hiro has become entangled in Hime's monstrous world. Together they must battle supernatural foes while trying to uncover the secrets of the mansion.",
