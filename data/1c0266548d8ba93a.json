  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It has been three years since the end of the Borgman project. The three surviving bio-enhanced humans - Chuck Sweager, Ryo Hibiki, and Anice Farm - have tried to adjust to normal lives, with varying degrees of success. Chuck has become a police officer, working alongside his girlfriend Miki Katsura. Ryo works as an engineer on a rocket project for NASA. Feeling unfulfilled flipping burgers, Anice accepts a job offer with a high-tech project in Japan and returns to Tokyo alone. Soon after, Chuck and Miki encounter a fight involving apparent cyborgs - something they had thought impossible since the Borgman subjects were the last ones. Their investigation into the mysterious new cyborgs leads them to believe the Heaven's Gate energy project may be involved. When Ryo hears Anice may be in danger, he rushes to Japan to find her. The two of them join forces with Chuck and Miki to infiltrate Heaven's Gate and uncover the truth. But this new breed of cyborg foe proves their most deadly challenge yet. Will the last three Borgman subjects be enough to overcome this cyber-threat? Or is humanity's fate sealed?",
