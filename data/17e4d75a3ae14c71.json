    "text": "Ryukyu Kingdom's 10th Lord Amawari, the ruler of Katsuren Castle, takes center stage in this short historical animation produced by Uruma City in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. The tale unfolds amidst the ruins of Katsuren Castle, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and delves into the life of this prominent historical figure who reigned before the annexation of the Ryukyu Kingdom by the Japanese empire. Amawari, often perceived as a villain for his rebellion against the Ryukyu Kingdom, is celebrated as a hero in the local region. This captivating animation, initially screened at a historical and cultural facility near Katsuren Castle Ruins, was released on YouTube for a limited time to mark the facility's first anniversary. The Omoro Soushi, an anthology of ancient poems and folk songs from the Ryukyu Kingdom, plays a significant role in the narrative.",
