    "text": "Kako, Furutaka, and their fellow Kan-musume, the embodiments of legendary warships, are humanity's ultimate defense against the menacing Abyssal Fleet, a formidable armada of mechanical monsters. At the Yokohama 'Dai-Ni-Kai 'KanColle' Kankanshiki' event in August 2015, it was revealed that this captivating Kantai Collection franchise would be gracing the silver screen in 2016.\n\nAmong the Kan-musume, the reserved Fubuki has managed to earn her place in the esteemed third torpedo squadron, overcoming her initial struggles. As the relentless battle against the Abyssal Fleet rages on, the Fleet Girls, including the Kongou sisters, Yuudachi, and Shimakaze, face unexpected challenges. Kisaragi, a fellow Kan-musume, suffers a tragic descent into the ocean's depths, only to resurface later with no recollection of her past and a growing transformation into an Abyssal.\n\nAs the Kan-musume grapple with the enigmatic crimson waters that harm their equipment, Fubuki remains inexplicably immune. The Fleet Girls embark on a perilous mission to uncover the truth behind these strange occurrences, their own existence, and the relentless Abyssal Fleet. With the future of humanity hanging in the balance, these valiant warriors must press on to liberate the seas and safeguard their cherished ones.",
