    "text": "The story unfolds with Akihito Kanbara, an immortal half-human, half-youmu, and Mirai Kuriyama, a bespectacled first-year student with a unique ability to manipulate her blood as a weapon. As a Spirit World warrior, Mirai is tasked with eliminating supernatural creatures known as youmu, which are born from negative human emotions. One day, Akihito stumbles upon Mirai seemingly ready to jump off the school roof, marking the beginning of their unconventional friendship.\n\nDespite her initial attempt to kill Akihito with her blood saber, Mirai discovers his immortal nature and his ability to heal quickly. As they grow closer, Mirai struggles with her isolation and self-doubt as a warrior. Meanwhile, Akihito introduces her to the Literary Club, where she meets other powerful Spirit World warriors, Hiroomi and Mitsuki Nase.\n\nAs their bond deepens, the group faces increasingly dangerous youmu encounters. The climax approaches with the impending release of the most powerful youmu, Beyond the Boundary. As they navigate their misadventures and battles, Mirai and Akihito must confront their personal struggles and fight for their survival against the relentless forces of the Spirit World.",
