    "text": "Mirai Kuriyama is a high school student gifted with the rare ability to manipulate her blood and wield it as a weapon against supernatural monsters called \"youmu\". Despite her powers, Mirai struggles with isolation and self-confidence. One day on the school roof, she encounters Akihito Kanbara, a boy who is secretly half-youmu. In a panic, Mirai stabs Akihito, only to discover he is immortal. As Mirai and Akihito form an unlikely friendship, disturbing events begin to unfold in their town. Mirai is tasked with hunting youmu, while Akihito aims to support her wavering self-assurance. They also join the school's Literary Club alongside Hiroomi and Mitsuki, two fellow warriors whose bond with Akihito and Mirai strengthens over time. However, the youmu around town also become stronger and more threatening. Beyond the Boundary, the most powerful youmu, will soon be released. Akihito and Mirai's misadventures are leading them into a fight for survival alongside their comrades. With the fate of the town at stake, the group of friends must work together to take down Beyond the Boundary.",
