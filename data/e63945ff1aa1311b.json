  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With a cruel twist of fate, a young duke finds himself bearing a deadly curse: anything he touches withers away into nothingness. Cast aside by his own family, he is condemned to a solitary existence within the confines of a grand manor. Yet, he is not entirely alone; his devoted butler, Rob, and the vivacious maid, Alice, remain by his side, providing companionship and solace. As his affection for Alice deepens, the duke grows increasingly frustrated with the constraints imposed by his curse. Unable to reciprocate Alice's flirtatious advances, he resolves to break the witch's spell, not just for his own sake, but for the chance to embrace the love that has thus far eluded his grasp. Will their love blossom, or will the curse prove too powerful to overcome?",
