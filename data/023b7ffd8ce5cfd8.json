One day, an unexpected encounter on the school's rooftop with a mysterious girl wearing strawberry-patterned panties sparks his curiosity and fuels his dreams. The girl vanishes, leaving behind a notebook belonging to Aya Toujou, but she doesn't match the girl from the rooftop.\n\nDetermined to find the girl who captured his heart, Junpei embarks on a quest to identify the owner of the strawberry panties. He confesses his feelings to the most beautiful girl in his class, Tsukasa Nishino, who also wears strawberry-patterned underwear, but she might not be the girl he's looking for. As he navigates through a series of encounters with various girls, each unique in their own way, Junpei realizes that finding his true love might be more complicated than he initially thought.\n\nIn this heartwarming and comedic tale, Manaka Junpei's search for the girl of his dreams leads him on a journey filled with unexpected twists and turns, ultimately teaching him valuable lessons about love and relationships.",
