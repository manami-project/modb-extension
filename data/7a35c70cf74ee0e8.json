    "text": "Tenpou, Kenren, and Konzen, once celestial beings in Heaven, find themselves in a tumultuous predicament 500 years before the events of Saiyuki. They become the reluctant guardians of Goku, a heretic child with golden eyes, under the watchful gaze of the Merciful Goddess Kanzeon Bosatsu. As Goku forms bonds with his caretakers and the War Prince Nataku, Heaven's intolerance for heretics threatens their newfound happiness.\n\nWhen an enraged Goku witnesses the death of his best friend, Heaven's patience wears thin, and they seek his demise. However, Konzen, Tenpou, and Kenren are determined to protect Goku, even if it means defying the celestial realm. Can they stand against the entire Western Army of Heaven to safeguard Goku and escape to the Lower World?",
