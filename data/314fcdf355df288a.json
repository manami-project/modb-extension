    "text": "Hayate, Maria, and a host of familiar faces receive an invitation from their wealthy friend, Nagi Sanzenin, to spend a glorious summer day at her family's private beach. While the group revels in the sun and surf, Nagi finds herself hesitating to join in the festivities. Plagued by self-consciousness due to her petite figure, she opts to stay indoors instead.\n\nAs Hayate and the others strive to coax Nagi out of her shell and into a swimsuit, an unexpected twist emerges: a vengeful spirit with a grudge against their fun-filled day makes its presence known. Can the group overcome this supernatural challenge and convince Nagi to embrace the joys of summer? Only time will tell in this exciting and heartwarming beach adventure.",
