    "text": "In a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by natural disasters, a brutal battle for survival rages between the remnants of humanity. The strongest warrior to emerge in this harsh new world is Violence Jack. When Jack discovers an underground city called Evil Town, inhabited by a wretched populace living in squalor, he steps in to intervene as civil war brews. Previously, Jack has already been embroiled in several conflicts across the destroyed lands. Now more than ever he aims to prevent further bloodshed and chaos. But peace is difficult to attain in Evil Town, where its citizens suffer extreme deprivation. Jack must contend with the various warring factions vying for control, including a group of unscrupulous salarymen, a gang of criminals and lunatics, and a community of abused women driven to isolate themselves. Tensions build to a breaking point over dwindling resources. All the while, the salarymen seek to tunnel their way to freedom. In the end, will Jack’s mighty strength be enough to stop the factions from tearing each other apart? Can there be any hope of reconciliation or escape for Evil Town’s blighted people? Jack faces his greatest test yet in preventing civil war and further loss of life in the subterranean slums.",
