  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Though a sequence of cataclysmic natural disasters has ravaged the Earth, leaving cities entombed beneath the ground and civilization in ruins, one formidable warrior rises above the chaos. Known as Violence Jack, this colossal figure finds himself in the heart of a subterranean city called Evil Town, where the struggle for survival has given way to savagery and brutality.\n\nIn the aftermath of a devastating earthquake, a once-thriving Japanese metropolis now lies buried, its survivors clinging to life in the darkness. The remnants of society have splintered into three distinct factions: the ordinary A group, the ruthless B group led by the monstrous Mad Saurus, and the all-female C group. As resources dwindle, the veneer of civility crumbles, and violence reigns.\n\nWhen the desperate A group uncovers the slumbering Violence Jack, they seek his aid against the B group's tyranny. But Jack's loyalties lie with the vulnerable C group, and he vows to shield them from the encroaching chaos. As the blood-soaked battle for survival looms, the question remains: can anyone escape the depths of this hellish new world? Based on a character created by manga horror legend Go Nagai, this is the tale of Violence Jack.",
