  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sleep ing through the seasons is not an option when martial arts mayhem is on the horizon! In this new 30-minute special of Ranma ½, based on Rumiko Takahashi's beloved manga series, the trouble begins when the mischievous Happosai resumes his underwear-stealing antics. Ranma, in his feminine form, intervenes to apprehend the culprit, but this only fuels Happosai's desire for revenge.\n\nTo get back at Ranma, Happosai concocts the powerful Deep Sleep Incense, designed to make its victim slumber until spring. However, in an unexpected twist, it's Akane who accidentally inhales the incense, causing her to act out her dreams and attack anyone who comes near. As the Tendo Dojo becomes a battlefield, Ranma and the rest of the gang must find a way to break the curse and wake Akane before it's too late.\n\nThis special was first shown at the 'It's a Rumic World' exhibition in Tokyo, celebrating the artwork of Rumiko Takahashi, and is based on the 'Nightmare! Incense of Spring Sleep' manga story from volume 34. Get ready for a fresh dose of Ranma ½ action, laughter, and chaos!",
