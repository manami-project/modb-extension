  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an alternate 1931 Japan, the Tokugawa shogunate still rules, upholding a blend of tradition and technological progress fueled by the discovery of Dragon Vein energy. However, rebel groups like Kuchinawa threaten the government's power through terrorism and assassination plots. To combat these threats, the shogunate forms Nue, an elite squad of executioners tasked with eliminating dissidents. Sawa Yukimura, the owner of a local bookshop, joins Nue's ranks, harboring a secret vendetta against Kuchinawa's leader, Janome. Years earlier, Janome slaughtered Sawa’s family, leaving her an orphan obsessed with revenge. Sawa possesses the ability to transform into a powerful battle form due to her mystical bloodline. She leverages this power to gain inside access to Nue’s operations, hoping they lead her to Janome. With Sawa and her supernatural gifts, Nue takes the fight to Kuchinawa in the streets and shadows of Tokyo. The age-old shogunate teeters in the balance as these warring factions plunge Japan into turmoil. Will imperial tradition prevail or give way to the tides of technological progress and instability?",
