  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a tragic carriage accident in 1868, English nobleman George Joestar takes in Dario Brando's son, Dio, as a gesture of gratitude for saving his life. Dio, however, harbors sinister intentions and schemes to usurp the Joestar fortune. Jonathan Joestar, George's son, becomes the target of Dio's cruel machinations as they grow up together. When Dio discovers an ancient Aztec stone mask with supernatural powers, he unleashes a vampiric curse upon himself, transforming into a formidable enemy. Jonathan must then unlock his own hidden abilities to confront his newly immortal adoptive brother.\n\nDecades later, the story continues in New York City with Jonathan's grandson, Joseph Joestar. As he uncovers his grandfather's legacy, Joseph learns of the stone mask's connection to the mysterious Pillar Men, powerful beings who threaten humanity's existence. With the weight of the world on his shoulders, Joseph embarks on a thrilling adventure to defeat the Pillar Men and put an end to the sinister influence of the stone mask once and for all. This epic horror-action-adventure follows the Joestar family's generational battles against supernatural foes, from Jonathan's initial struggle against Dio to Joseph's confrontation with the Pillar Men.",
