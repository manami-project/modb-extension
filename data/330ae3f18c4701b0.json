  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryoko—at once a loving sister and a formidable mercenary—assigns her high school-aged brother, Shungo, a mission of a different sort. To aid the Tsukimura siblings, particularly Mayu, who grapples with androphobia, Shungo must welcome them into his spacious home. Mayu's succubus powers unintentionally draw men to her, making it crucial for her to overcome her fear. Ryoko's unconventional approach to helping Mayu involves placing her in close quarters with Shungo, sharing a room, bed, and even bath time.\n\nAs Shungo navigates this delicate situation, he finds himself juggling the challenges that come with Mayu's growing popularity at school and the affections of Reika, the student council president. In a surprising turn of events, Reika becomes their maid, adding another layer of complexity to Shungo's new living arrangement. With his ordinary life turned upside down, Shungo must rise to the challenge and help Mayu conquer her fears while safeguarding her from the unwanted attention her powers attract.",
