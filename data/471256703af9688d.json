    "text": "Ruka's mundane summer takes an extraordinary turn when she encounters two enigmatic boys, Umi and Sora, at the aquarium where her father works. Drawn towards the aquarium since her childhood encounter with a ghostly apparition in the water, Ruka finds herself captivated by the boys' exceptional swimming abilities and their mysterious connection to the sea. Raised by dugongs, Umi and Sora share Ruka's affinity for the ocean, hearing the same inexplicable calls from the depths.\n\nAs the trio delves deeper into the underwater realm, the world witnesses a perplexing phenomenon: fish populations around the globe are inexplicably vanishing. While Ruka's father and the aquarium staff remain largely oblivious to the children's experiences, the three friends embark on a thrilling marine adventure, uncovering secrets about the ocean and its inhabitants. Amidst this enchanting journey, Ruka, Umi, and Sora learn about an extraordinary undersea festival that all marine life seems to be anticipating. Join Ruka, Umi, and Sora in Children of the Sea, an anime adaptation of Daisuke Igarashi's manga, as they navigate this captivating underwater world that will enthrall all your senses.",
