    "text": "Mizuki is a 19-year-old male fashion model who lives in a nice apartment. One evening, he encounters Kazuomi, who has just been kicked out by his girlfriend after admitting he was only interested in her physically. Now homeless, Kazuomi boldly asks if he can stay with Mizuki in exchange for sex. Though initially hesitant, Mizuki becomes intrigued by desires he has not felt before as the night goes on. Meanwhile, serial playboy Kazuomi finds himself unexpectedly developing real feelings for Mizuki beyond the physical. This marks uncharted emotional territory for someone who has always loved casually and never truly committed to anyone. As the two spend more time together, both Mizuki and Kazuomi discover longings that neither has experienced previously. Their physical arrangement shows signs of becoming something deeper. Where this newfound connection leads remains to be seen.",
