  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shoujo Heidi, a beloved anime, revolves around the life of a young orphaned girl named Heidi. Raised initially by her aunt Dete, Heidi's life takes a turn when her aunt secures a job and is unable to care for her any longer. As a result, Heidi finds herself in the Swiss mountains, living with her estranged grandfather, a recluse with a hardened heart. Despite his initial reluctance, Heidi's innocence and pure heart soften her grandfather, and she finds joy and friendship in Peter, a local goatherd, exploring the mountains together. However, Heidi's life may take another unexpected turn as she is considered for a move to Frankfurt to live with the affluent Sesemann family and become a companion to Clara, their wheelchair-bound daughter.\n\nThe anime has undergone several adaptations, including a condensed movie version and two OVAs, Alps no Shoujo Heidi: Alm no Yama Hen and Alps no Shoujo Heidi: Heidi to Clara Hen. Interestingly, these adaptations featured different voice actors for various characters, except for Heidi and her grandfather. However, subsequent releases saw the original voice cast from the series being reinstated, providing fans with a familiar and cherished viewing experience.",
