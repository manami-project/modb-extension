  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Otary-man, a unique blend of otaku and salaryman, is a personal account of Yoshitani, an author who moonlights as a system engineer. This anime delves into the everyday life of a typical Japanese office worker with a twist - the protagonist is an unabashed otaku.\n\nLiving solo in a bustling metropolis, Yoshitani grapples with the mundane challenges of office politics and household chores, all viewed through the lens of his otaku lifestyle. From the quirky battles with an intrusive Kleenex box to the thrill of reading hentai manga in a caf√©, Yoshitani's life is anything but dull.\n\nAs he juggles the trials and tribulations of the corporate world and domestic life, Yoshitani's days are filled with vibrancy and humor. Whether he's being critiqued for his fashion sense, steering clear of high school girls, or tackling the monotony of laundry, Yoshitani's otaku perspective adds a unique flavor to his otherwise ordinary life. Join Yoshitani as he navigates the complexities of work and life with an infectious energy that will leave you rooting for him!",
