  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yoshitani is an ordinary Japanese salaryman living alone in a big city. Though he works a typical office job, he also has an otaku perspective on life that makes his daily struggles uniquely lively. We follow Yoshitani as he faces workplace politics and performs domestic chores, all while making time to enjoy his hobbies like reading manga at caf√©s. Despite the loneliness, Yoshitani approaches each day with positivity and humor. Whether he's dodging judgmental glances about his fashion sense, avoiding awkward encounters with high school girls, or battling anthropomorphic household objects, Yoshitani tries to find the fun in it all. Through Yoshitani's eyes, we see an amusing and relatable take on the life of an everyday salaryman. With resilience and passion for his interests, he attempts to balance work, personal responsibilities, and otaku indulgences. Though misadventures abound, Yoshitani's vibrant mindset gives a quirky charm to this slice-of-life tale.",
