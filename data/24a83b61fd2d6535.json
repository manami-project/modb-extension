    "text": "Holmes Detective Academy, a prestigious institution in the bustling city of Yokohama, trains detectives to combat the rise of phantom thieves in an era known as the Age of Detectives. In this world, individuals possess unique abilities called 'Toys', which grant them extraordinary powers. Among the academy's top students are four talented girls known as Milky Holmes: Sherlock, Nero, Hercules, and Cordelia. Renowned for their teamwork and Toyz-powered case-solving prowess, they're admired by both their peers and the citizens of Yokohama.\n\nOne fateful stormy night, Milky Holmes confronts their arch-rivals, the Phantom Empire, in a fierce battle. However, the girls suffer an unexpected defeat, resulting in the loss of their Toyz. Stripped of their powers and prestige, they're relocated to a rundown attic and face expulsion if they fail to regain their abilities within three months.\n\nDetermined to reclaim their former glory, the once-celebrated detectives embark on a challenging journey to recover their Toyz. As they navigate through this new phase of their lives, they must learn to adapt and continue their detective work without relying on the powers that once defined them. Join Milky Holmes in their quest to restore their reputation as the world's greatest detectives.",
