    "text": "In a distant future, humanity lives underground in villages like Giha, suffering earthquakes and cave-ins while dreaming of the surface world. Simon is a shy, naive boy who finds a drill that is key to their destiny. His friend Kamina believes fiercely in the surface world. One day the ceiling collapses and a Gunman robot and Yoko, a girl with a powerful rifle, fall into their village - proof of Kamina's beliefs! Kamina rallies Simon and Yoko to defeat the Gunman using Lagann, a robot Simon discovered. Breaking through to the surface world of their dreams, they find it ruled by the tyrannical Spiral King and beastmen armies. Their lust for freedom becomes a war for humanity's future. Simon must realize his hidden strength if their rebellion is to pierce the heavens and bring hope to the desperate surface dwellers. This is a tale of epic mecha battles, dizzying action, and boundless spirit as Simon, Kamina, Yoko and their allies challenge the odds to change their world's destiny. Their motto rings out: \"Pierce the heavens with your drill, Gurren Lagann!\"",
