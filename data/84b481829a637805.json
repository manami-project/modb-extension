  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Heiji Hattori and Conan Edogawa join forces in the cultural heart of Kyoto to solve a perplexing case involving a series of murders and a stolen Buddha statue. The victims are members of the Genjibotaru, a notorious group of thieves known for stealing valuable artifacts from Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. As the body count rises, the police are left clueless, unsure if the motive is revenge or an internal power struggle.\n\nMeanwhile, Detective Mouri is summoned to the Sannou Temple to investigate the disappearance of a sacred Buddha statue. With no leads to follow, the temple's anonymous letter containing a cryptic puzzle is their only hope. As Conan and Hattori delve deeper into the case, they find themselves entangled in a web of mysteries, traps, and dangerous encounters with a masked assailant.\n\nWith Hattori's extensive knowledge of Kyoto and Conan's sharp wit, they must navigate the city's dark corners to bring the truth to light. As the stakes grow higher and the masked killer continues to claim lives, Conan and Hattori must act quickly to solve the puzzle, apprehend the murderer, and save Hattori's childhood love before it's too late.",
