  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a future where humans and robots coexist peacefully, a series of mysterious murders shatters the harmony. Someone or something begins systematically destroying the seven most powerful robots in the world, including the great Swiss hero Mont Blanc. With no clear motive or suspect, Europol detective Gesicht takes the case. Gesicht soon discovers he is one of the remaining robot targets. As he investigates further, a human robot rights activist is also murdered in similar brutal fashion. Clues point to a shadowy figure named Pluto behind the killings. Gesicht seeks out Atom, a boy-like state of the art android, to help stop Pluto before the attacks trigger irreparable damage between man and machine. Racing against time, Gesicht and Atom must uncover Pluto's true identity and end the cycle of violence threatening the stability of human and robot relations. Will the detective solve the mystery and prevent further loss of life, both carbon and steel? Or will the deadly rampage continue to sow chaos and discord?",
