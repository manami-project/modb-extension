    "text": "Tezuka Osamu's manga Tetsuwan Atom is reimagined in a world where robots and humans live harmoniously, with robots programmed to understand emotions and forbidden from harming living beings. However, this peace is shattered when the world's most powerful robots, including the revered Swiss robot Mont Blanc, are mysteriously destroyed one by one. Europol's robotic detective, Gesicht, is assigned to the case, but the investigation takes a dark turn when he discovers that he, too, is a target. As he delves deeper into the mystery, Gesicht uncovers a sinister force known as \"Pluto,\" hell-bent on sowing chaos and destruction. With the help of Atom, a highly advanced android, Gesicht must race against time to stop the rogue killer before the remaining elite robots are eliminated, and the delicate balance between humans and robots is forever disrupted. As Gesicht navigates the complex case, haunting memories from his past resurface, adding another layer of intrigue to this thrilling tale of murder, mystery, and self-discovery.",
