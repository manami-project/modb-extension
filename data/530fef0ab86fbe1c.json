    "text": "Episodes of \"The Romantica Clock\" introduce viewers to the dynamic twin duo of Akane and Aoi. Akane, a lively and beautiful 14-year-old, captures the hearts of those around her with her vivacious personality. In contrast, her twin brother Aoi presents a more aloof demeanor, but hides an intelligent and cunning mind beneath his unassuming exterior. Despite their shared upbringing, Akane harbors a deep-seated jealousy towards Aoi, which has persisted since their early childhood. As they grow older, Akane's rivalry with her brother only intensifies, making it difficult for the twins to form a close bond. Catch a glimpse of their unique relationship in this delightful comedy, with select episodes available for streaming ahead of their official broadcast.",
