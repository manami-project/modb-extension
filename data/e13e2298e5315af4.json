  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime tells the story of a chance encounter between a boy and a girl in a town plagued by discrimination. The boy wears red clothing, which designates him as an outcast in this color-coded society. Despite his low social standing, he continues his education by attending night school. There, he passes by a girl in a deep blue uniform every day. Their eyes meet one day while riding a lift, sparking a memory for both the boy and girl of when they first met. In the past, the girl had come across the boy scribbling a message on a wall. She understood the meaning behind his words and responded with an enigmatic smile. This fleeting yet profound exchange left an imprint on both individuals. Now, their paths cross once more in this evocative tale exploring social divides, everyday perseverance, and the connections formed by small acts of understanding. With its stylized animation and emotional resonance, this short film delivers a powerful narrative about human bonds transcending societal barriers.",
