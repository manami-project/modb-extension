  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Midori is a bubbly first-year student at the newly opened Hijiri Academy. On her first day, she spots the tall, stoic Akira Sudou caring for a stray kitten, and instantly falls for him. A few months later, Midori trips and embarrasses herself while giving a speech for the student council elections. To her surprise, Akira comes to her aid and they both end up being elected as president and vice president. As they work together planning Hijiri Academy's inaugural school festival, Midori tries to get closer to Akira, who remains somewhat distant. She suspects he may have a girlfriend, though her friends encourage her blossoming feelings. Bit by bit, Akira begins opening up to Midori as they share memories of festivals past and hopes for their school's future. Though parts of Akira's mysterious history give Midori pause, she is determined to support him as his friend and vice president, if not something more.",
