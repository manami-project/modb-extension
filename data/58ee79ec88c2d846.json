  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the distant past, there was a war between humanity and the angels. An angel named Apollonius fell in love with a human girl named Celiane and betrayed his own kind to help the humans, even giving up his wings. Together they created powerful mecha warriors called Aquarion that allowed the humans to fight back against the angels. Apollonius was eventually killed by his former angel comrade Touma, who corrupted a human prince named Scorpius to carry out the betrayal. 12,000 years later, the angels have returned to steal the life force of humans once again. An organization called Deava is fighting to protect humanity, aided by the reincarnations of Apollonius and Celiane. The main characters include Apollo, a seemingly normal boy who is actually the reincarnation of Apollonius, and Silvia, a girl mourning the loss of her brother Sirius in battle. As they fight together, there are hints that they may be the modern reincarnations of Apollonius and Celiane. Touma is also back as the leader of the attacking angels. There are legends that Apollonius will return one day to finish the ancient battle against the angels. As Touma's attacks continue, Apollo starts to awaken memories of his past life and destiny. The key to humanity's survival may lie in Apollo embracing his true power as Apollonius.",
