  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Second-years Mao Tsuchiya, a film club member, and his solitary roommate, Hisashi Ootomo, establish three rules for cohabitation: Mao must keep Hisashi's homosexual relationship a secret, Hisashi must not develop romantic feelings for Mao, and they must respect each other's personal time. However, their peaceful coexistence is disrupted when Hisashi is offered the lead role in the film club's upcoming movie, a boys' love story, despite Mao's initial objections. As Mao begins to envision Hisashi in the delinquent role, he finds himself grappling with feelings that extend beyond friendship for his roommate. Despite knowing Hisashi is unattainable, Mao can no longer deny the truth about his own emotions.",
