  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the heels of a colossal battle between humanity and alien forces, Basara, the former frontman of the rock band 'Fire Bomber', embarks on a solitary journey through the cosmos. His voyage leads him to the remote planet Zola, a unique celestial body teeming with the extraordinary space whales. These cosmic creatures possess an immense power source, making them a valuable target for interstellar poachers.\n\nOn this unfamiliar terrain, Basara encounters Elma, a fervent admirer of his former band, and her father Graham, a seasoned whale fisherman. As Basara becomes entangled in the escalating conflict between ruthless poachers and anti-poaching patrols, he discovers Graham's deep-seated vendetta against a rare white space whale.\n\nDetermined to prevent the impending slaughter and protect the celestial giants, Basara must once again harness the power of his Spiritia abilities and the universal language of music to defuse the tension and bring peace to the cosmos. Along the way, viewers will be treated to fresh musical compositions and the reappearance of a slightly more mature Mylene.",
