    "text": "Witch craft and magic have captivated the heart of young Akko Kagari ever since she witnessed the enchanting performance of her idol, Shiny Chariot. With the inspiring words \"a believing heart is your magic\" etched into her soul, Akko sets her sights on becoming a witch as extraordinary as her role model. To chase her dream, she enrolls in the prestigious Luna Nova Academy, a school for witches that also happens to be Shiny Chariot's alma mater.\n\nOn her eventful journey to the academy, Akko crosses paths with Lotte and Sucy, two fellow witches-in-training who quickly become her closest friends. Despite her non-magical background, Akko's unwavering spirit and determination propel her through the challenges she faces at Luna Nova. From mastering broom-riding to uncovering hidden secrets, Akko's magical adventures are far from ordinary.\n\nAs Akko and her friends navigate the tumultuous events that the academy throws their way, they learn valuable lessons about the true essence of magic and the importance of believing in oneself. In a world where the enchantment of witchcraft is fading, Little Witch Academia invites viewers to join Akko on her journey to becoming the witch she's always dreamed of being.",
