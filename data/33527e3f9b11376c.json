    "text": "PS2 game's promotional OVA, Growlanser IV Returns, presents a world recovering from a devastating war, where Valcania, Dulkheim, and Igrecias have formed a confederation to establish a new political order. However, discontent still simmers, leading to a planned rebellion in Valcania's capital. Lady Dianna Silvernale, the Royal Guard's captain, finds herself in a dilemma: join Prince Lyros in his coup to reclaim Valcania or uphold her duty to prevent another war. Amidst this turmoil, characters from previous Growlanser series make appearances, weaving a tale of anti-war themes, time manipulation, and parallel worlds. With time running out, Silvernale's decision could determine the fate of her nation and its people.",
