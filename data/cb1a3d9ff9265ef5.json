    "text": "Between the bustling streets of Shibuya, Japan, in 2008, a series of grisly murders known as the 'New Gen' events unfold, sending ripples of fear throughout the city. Takumi Nishijou, a solitary high school student and avid gamer, finds his mundane life of attending classes and indulging in online games disrupted when he stumbles upon disturbing images of these murders both online and in real life.\n\nAs Takumi's perception of reality begins to blur, he encounters a mysterious pink-haired girl at a gruesome crime scene, further fueling his confusion. Struggling to discern what's real and what's not, Takumi becomes entangled in a dangerous web of delusions and reality, all while being pursued by the suspected perpetrator of the 'New Gen' murders.\n\nAs the line between reality and delusion continues to fade, Takumi must navigate the treacherous streets of Shibuya, encountering scientific concepts such as matter, antimatter, and the Dirac sea. With an uncertain grasp on reality and an ever-growing sense of paranoia, Takumi must unravel the truth behind the 'New Gen' murders and the enigmatic pink-haired girl before it's too late. Can Takumi trust his own eyes and survive the chaos that surrounds him?",
