    "text": "Mahiro Fuwa, a young boy gripped by vengeance, and Yoshino Takigawa, his best friend caught in the whirlwind of destiny, find themselves entangled in a battle transcending time and space. Hakaze Kusaribe, the exiled sorceress princess of the Kusaribe clan, seeks their aid from a desolate island. The Kusaribe family, guardians of the 'Tree of Origins', are split by internal strife, with one faction aiming to revive the destructive 'Tree of World's End'.\n\nMahiro, driven by the tragic loss of his younger sister, Aika, strikes a deal with Hakaze. In exchange for her magical assistance in tracking down Aika's killer, he vows to help her thwart the catastrophic plans of her brother, Samon. Yoshino, unaware of the looming chaos, is unwittingly drawn into this saga of revenge and magic when he is saved by Mahiro from a mysterious girl.\n\nAs the trio navigates through this irrational world, they must confront their sanity, convictions, and the thin line between sense and madness. The fate of the world hangs in the balance, and the journey to uncover the truth behind Aika's death promises to be a perilous one. Will they be the saviors the world needs, or will they succumb to the darkness that threatens to consume them? Only time will tell in this tragic tale of magic, revenge, and the bonds of friendship.",
