  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ganjin, a revered Chinese monk, became the beacon of Buddhism in Japan after multiple daunting attempts to reach the island nation. In 742 AD, two Japanese monks, captivated by Ganjin's wisdom, invited him to spread the teachings of Buddha in their homeland. Despite facing relentless adversity, including the loss of his eyesight and five failed voyages, Ganjin's unwavering determination led him to Japan on his sixth attempt in 754 AD.\n\nUpon his arrival, Ganjin established the Tōshōdai-ji temple in Nara, significantly contributing to the development of Japanese Buddhism. His teachings not only fortified the foundations of the Vinaya sect but also indirectly influenced the emergence of two prominent Japanese Buddhist masters, Kukairen of Shingon and Saicheng of the Tendai Sect. This subsequently ushered in a golden age of Buddhism during the Heian and Ikura periods.\n\nGanjin's impact transcended religious boundaries, as he played a pivotal role in transmitting various aspects of Tang culture to Japan. From architecture and sculpture to calligraphy, painting, and medicine, Ganjin's influence left an indelible mark on Japanese society. As a result, he is fondly remembered as the 'giant of balance culture' in Japan. This animated film aims to shed light on the extraordinary life and legacy of this remarkable figure.",
