    "text": "So you think you know the tale of a magical girl? Well, think again. Meet Utena Hiiragi, a typical middle school girl with an atypical obsession for magical girls. When a peculiar mascot offers her the chance to join the ranks of her beloved heroes, she jumps at the opportunity. However, Utena's magical girl journey takes a dark turn as she finds herself on the wrong side of the battlefield, fighting against the very heroes she once admired. As the leader of an evil organization, Utena revels in her newfound power, taking twisted pleasure in tormenting her magical adversaries. Will Utena's descent into darkness continue unchecked, or will her \"toys\" find a way to put an end to her sadistic games? Join Utena on her wicked journey as she redefines what it means to be a magical girl.",
