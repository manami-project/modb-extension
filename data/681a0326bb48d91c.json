    "text": "Now, Yori Yuki, a young man with exceptional talents, finds himself grappling with an intense, forbidden love for his twin sister, Iku. Once inseparable, Yori has recently grown distant, leaving Iku bewildered and hurt. Unbeknownst to her, Yori's cold demeanor masks his deep-seated feelings for her, feelings that society deems taboo. As Iku, an average student who relies heavily on her brother's academic prowess, tries to understand Yori's sudden change in behavior, Yori struggles to contain his emotions.\n\nYori's attempts to quell his feelings, including a brief liaison with Iku's best friend and plans to attend a boarding school in another city, prove futile. When Iku begins discussing potential boyfriends and dates, Yori's resolve crumbles, leading him to confess his love. Despite the societal norms and the complexities of their relationship, Iku, who cherishes her bond with her brother, is willing to do anything to keep them together. However, Yori yearns for Iku's love not as a sister, but as a lover. As they navigate this tumultuous journey, one question lingers: Can their forbidden love transcend societal norms and the bonds of siblinghood?",
