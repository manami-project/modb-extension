  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kōki Narumi, a high school student with a hidden talent, finds himself in a whirlwind of amusing escapades and risqué situations when he joins Ousui Academy's student council. As the secret author of a racy romantic comedy manga, Kōki has managed to keep his identity under wraps, with only his younger sister Toa and best friend Mihiro in the know. However, when the otaku student council president, Kaoruko Rokuonji, discovers his clandestine profession, she seizes the opportunity to recruit him to the council. In exchange for her silence, Kōki reluctantly agrees to join, much to the chagrin of the headstrong vice president, Ashe R. Sakuragi.\n\nAs Kōki navigates the challenges of being a student council member, he finds himself surrounded by a colorful cast of characters. Along with Kaoruko, Ashe, and Mihiro, there's Toa, a quiet computer programming whiz and Kōki's own younger sister. Together, these adorable girls keep themselves entertained by getting into all sorts of mischief around school and town, especially when their crush, Kōki, isn't around. With various student requests and troubles piling up, Kōki's life is about to get a lot more complicated – and a whole lot more entertaining.",
