The shorts feature both rising talents and industry veterans, sometimes even collaborating together. Notable directors involved include Outarou Maijou, Mahiro Maeda, Shinji Aramaki, Hiroyuki Imaishi, and Sayo Yamamoto. While productions operate on limited budgets and schedules, the result is a diverse showcase that highlights the future of anime. From mecha to slice-of-life to avant-garde, Japan Anima(tor)'s Exhibition gives viewers a glimpse into creative minds pushing the possibilities of animation.",
