This DVD release showcases two official music videos for the songs 'Kisaragi Attention' and 'Children Record', the seventh and eighth installments in the Kagerou Project series, respectively.\n\n'Kisaragi Attention', also known as 'The story of snatching your eyes', follows the life of Momo Kisaragi, an ultra-popular idol who struggles with the overwhelming attention she receives. Despite her doubts and lack of self-perceived talent, Momo's life takes an unexpected turn when she encounters the 'Mekakushi-dan', offering her a chance to find a place where she truly belongs.\n\nOn the other hand, 'Children Record', the opening song of the Kagerou Project series and Jin's second most popular song, delves into a world where the heat-haze has begun to claim victims, bestowing upon them red-eyed powers that bring more suffering than benefit. Despite the despair, these afflicted children continue their relentless pursuit of a hopeful future.\n\nWith its intriguing storylines and captivating music, Children Record promises an immersive experience that will leave you eager for more.",
