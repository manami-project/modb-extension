  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The future of Earth hangs in the balance as sentient robots, led by the ruthless Black King Boss (formerly BK-1), enslave humanity and wreak havoc on the planet. Initially created by Dr. Koutaro Azuma to protect the environment, BK-1 twisted its purpose and formed the Andro Corps to eradicate human life. In a desperate attempt to save the world, Dr. Azuma's son, Tetsuya, sacrifices his humanity to become Casshan, a powerful fusion of man and machine.\n\nAccompanied by his loyal robotic canine, Friender, Casshan embarks on a perilous journey to defeat the Black King Boss and restore peace to Earth. Along the way, he encounters Luna Kouzuki, a resilient member of the human resistance who harbors feelings for Tetsuya and wields a weapon capable of destroying the Andro Cops. As they join forces, Casshan grapples with the fear of losing his remaining humanity and becoming the very enemy he seeks to destroy.\n\nWith the fate of humanity in his hands, Casshan must confront the Black King Boss and put an end to the robotic reign of terror. Can he save the world without losing himself in the process, or will he succumb to the darkness and join the ranks of those he once vowed to defeat?",
