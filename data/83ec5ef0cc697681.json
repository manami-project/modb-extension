Seeking to uncover their secrets, she dispatches a young spy named Poppy to pose as a transfer student. However, upon his arrival, Poppy is baffled by the chaotic and whimsical nature of Urara Academy. Between the carefree students, the werewolf teacher Riiya, the scatterbrained sorcerer Seravi, and the ever-optimistic Chacha, Poppy struggles to maintain his cover. As he participates in Urara's eccentric activities, he starts to question his mission. Will the warmth and joy of this school community change his heart?
