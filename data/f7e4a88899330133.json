  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The film centers on the intertwined romantic relationships between members of the band \"Given\" and those in their orbit. Bassist Haruki Nakayama harbors unrequited feelings for drummer Akihiko Kaji, who remains entangled with violinist ex-boyfriend Ugetsu Murata. Meanwhile, guitarist Ritsuka Uenoyama and vocalist Mafuyu Sato explore a tentative new romance. As the band prepares original songs for a music competition, Mafuyu turns to Ugetsu for inspiration to write emotionally resonant lyrics. Their encounters highlight Ugetsu's inability to let go of Akihiko completely. Haruki reaches his limit witnessing Akihiko turn to him for comfort out of frustration with Ugetsu, threatening the band's unity. At its core, the film navigates the clashing currents of lingering affections for the past and aspirations for the future. The characters confront whether certain attachments can weather emotional tumult, or if only regret will remain among the ruins of heartbreak. Beyond the band's success, it remains to be seen what interpersonal bonds can ultimately be salvaged.",
