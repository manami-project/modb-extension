  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With a heart full of dread for vegetables and milk, young Mari navigates through her everyday life, taking detours to avoid the daunting 'Fear's Bridge'. Her world turns upside down when her friend, Momo, leaves her to face her fears alone, and her teacher sets a goal to clean their plates at lunchtime. Forced to consume her least favorite foods - carrots, peppers, and milk, Mari faints, only to awaken in the nurse's office surrounded by three peculiar food spirits: Ninninman, Piiman, and Milk. As Mari embarks on this unexpected journey, she learns valuable lessons about friendship and overcoming her fears, guided by her newfound companions. This charming anime is a product of the Young Animator Training Project, an initiative by the Agency of Cultural Affairs of Japan and Japan Animation Creators Association (JaniCA).",
