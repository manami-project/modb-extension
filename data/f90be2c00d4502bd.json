    "text": "He's a top-tier spy known as Twilight, but to the world, he's Loid Forger, a humble psychiatrist and devoted family man. Alongside his psychic daughter Anya and assassin wife Yor, he's juggling his secret missions with the everyday challenges of family life. As he navigates the complexities of grocery shopping, cartoon watching, and cheering up his moody wife, he remains unaware that Yor's foul mood stems from a bullet wound she's concealing. Meanwhile, Anya, the only one privy to their true identities, is determined to excel academically and secure a place as an Imperial Scholar to aid Loid's covert mission, Operation Strix. With the family dog Bond, gifted with precognition, and Franky, their trusted ally, watching their backs, the Forgers embark on a cruise ship expedition, adding another layer to their already intricate family mission. Amidst the chaos and secrecy, the Forgers find genuine love and warmth in their unconventional family setup, making every mission worthwhile.",
