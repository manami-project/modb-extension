  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the midst of an ordinary city, an unnamed high school girl's life takes a dramatic turn when she encounters Cheko, a maid hailing from a village of maids. Cheko is no ordinary maid, boasting a plethora of peculiar abilities, such as detaching her head and transforming her body into various substances. The oddities don't end there, as a motley crew of eccentric characters join the fray, including Mizore, a snow spirit with an aversion to cold, Nachiko, a talking squid with a penchant for face-swapping, and Kanato, the toughest Yankee in town. Brace yourself for a rollercoaster ride of absurdity and laughter as these extraordinary beings wreak havoc in the once-normal life of a typical high school student.",
