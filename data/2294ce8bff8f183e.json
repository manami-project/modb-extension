  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Third Entertainment Section's newest idol project brings together nine young girls, all aspiring idols, and all under 149 cm tall. Among them is Arisu Tachibana, a mature grade school student eager to make her mark in the world of idols. However, their first meeting with their producer leaves them taken aback. Instead of the seasoned professional they expected, they're met with a childlike adult who's as new to the role as they are to the industry. Despite the initial awkwardness, the producer's genuine passion for idols and his determination to see them succeed win the girls over. As they embark on their journey to the stage, they're faced with the challenges of inexperience, the allure of a charming prince, and the daunting task of conquering the entertainment world. This is the story of their growth, both as idols and as individuals, guided by their equally diminutive rookie producer. The U149 idols are ready to make their dreams come true and reach for the stars.",
