    "text": "The Idolm@ster Cinderella Girls: U149 follows a group of nine aspiring idols who share two things in common - they are all under 149 cm tall, and they all dream of making it big on the stage one day. Though inexperienced, these petite girls are determined to become pop idols. When the girls first meet their rookie producer, they are surprised to find he is just as short as them. Despite the awkward introduction, the producer shows genuine passion for idols and is serious about helping the U149 girls shine. With his guidance, the group works hard amid distractions - including a handsome prince that catches their eye - in hopes of gaining experience and taking the entertainment world by storm. Full of energy and dreams, the small but mighty members of U149 are ready to overcome their lack of experience through hard work. With some guidance from their equally short but devoted producer, these tiny idols are determined to make their way to the top of the entertainment industry. Their journey shows that size and experience may not matter when you have real talent and true grit.",
