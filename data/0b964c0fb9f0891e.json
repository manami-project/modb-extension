  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the heart of a barren desert, a peculiar circus, Wolf Zirkus, comes to life. The spotlight shines on Popee, a quirky clown donning a striking red-striped jumpsuit and bunny ears. Known for his juggling skills and an uncanny ability to produce knives and bombs out of nowhere, Popee is the circus's star attraction. However, his mischievous antics often overshadow his performances, leading to hilarious attempts to outwit his fellow performers, especially his hapless assistant and the circus owner.\n\nJoining Popee is Kedamono, a mysterious purple creature in a mask, who becomes both his partner in performance and the target of his pranks. Together, they navigate the unpredictable world of the circus, where the ordinary is extraordinary. From practicing their acts to dodging alien abductions and dealing with a body-possessing frog, every day is a new adventure.\n\nAs they journey through the endless desert, searching for an elusive oasis, Popee and Kedamono, along with the flamboyant Papi and a special elephant car, turn the circus into a chaotic yet entertaining spectacle. Despite the constant danger of Popee's homicidal tendencies, the show must go on, offering a rollercoaster ride of laughter, suspense, and the unexpected.",
