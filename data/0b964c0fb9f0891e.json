  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Popee the Performer takes place in a small circus stranded in the desert, following the antics of its eccentric cast of characters. The star of the show is Popee, an energetic clown prone to causing chaos. Dressed in a distinctive red-striped bunny suit and adept at tricks like juggling and pulling weapons out of thin air, Popee constantly hatches absurd schemes to \"humorously destroy\" his fellow performers, particularly his mild-mannered assistant Kedamono. However, Popee's plans never seem to succeed, instead sending the circus into wacky cartoon hijinks. Alongside the daring performances and fruitless attempts at sabotage, the show also depicts the troupe rehearsing acts, traveling through the desert in search of an oasis, and dealing with bizarre occurrences like alien abductions. Though living in the harsh environment taxes the performers, the zany world of the Wolf Zirkus circus ensures there's never a dull day under the big top.",
