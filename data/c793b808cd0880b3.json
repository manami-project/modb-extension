  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese-style harmony, or 'Wa', comes to life through the adventures of Shiba-wanko, a diligent Shiba-inu dog, and Miike-nyanko, a temperamental calico cat, in their traditional Japanese home. As roommates, the two share a life filled with everyday chores, from cooking and cleaning to laundry, in a house adorned with a classic tokonoma alcove.\n\nThe gentle and hardworking Shiba-wanko takes charge of the household tasks, while the headstrong Miike-nyanko struggles to contribute. Together, they explore the richness of Japanese culture and customs, from embracing the beauty of the autumn moon to learning the etiquette of hosting guests.\n\nBased on a beloved children's book by Yoshie Kawaura, each chapter of this heartwarming anime delves into a specific aspect of Japanese life, from donning the elegant kimono to ringing in the New Year. Join Shiba-wanko and Miike-nyanko as they navigate the seasons and uncover the true essence of 'Wa' in their delightful, shared journey.",
