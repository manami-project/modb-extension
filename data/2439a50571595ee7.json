  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the ongoing intergalactic war between two advanced civilizations - the Paranoids, a race of alien humanoids, and the Solenoids, an all-female race. After centuries of conflict, both sides have deployed powerful \"Planet Destroyers\" that have led to the loss of their homeworlds. The story centers on Lufy, a hardened Solenoid warrior who is discovered frozen lifeless in space debris. She is brought on board a Solenoid ship and revived, given a second chance at life. Lufy is grief-stricken to learn of the failed \"Species Unification Plan\" and the continued destruction while she was frozen. Making matters worse, she finds out another android clone of her former crewmate Catty is aboard the ship. Despite her shaken faith and weakened resolve, Lufy must rally alongside the remaining Solenoid crew as they head toward one of the last standing Solenoid strongholds in space. She faces the monumental task of not only determining the fate of the two warring races, but also protecting the hope of a mysterious third race on the planet Terra. The outlook remains bleak, but Lufy represents the last glimmer of hope to somehow end this apocalyptic war ravaging the galaxy.",
