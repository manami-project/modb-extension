    "text": "Fen and Miao Shi, siblings with contrasting personalities, return for another season of their high school adventures in the fourth installment of Ani ni Tsukeru Kusuri wa Nai. Broadcasted in China from August 2020 and in Japan from October 2, 2020, this season promises the same blend of humor, sibling love, and unexpected antics.\n\nDespite Miao's constant attempts to curb her older brother's eccentric behavior, Fen's unpredictable nature persists, much to her exasperation. Yet, beneath his reckless exterior, Fen harbors good intentions, fostering a close-knit circle of friends that includes Kai Xin, Wan Sui, and Miaomiao. Together, they navigate the trials and tribulations of high school life, transforming the ordinary into the extraordinary.\n\nMiao, an athletic and assertive individual, often resorts to physical means to express her frustration towards her brother. However, Fen's seemingly incurable foolishness and endless stream of absurd ideas continue to challenge her patience. Despite their differences, the siblings share an unbreakable bond that forms the heart of this entertaining school comedy. Prepare for a rollercoaster ride of laughter, romance, and culinary delights as the Shi siblings and their friends embark on another unforgettable school year.",
