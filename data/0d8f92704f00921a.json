  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Urabe Yukito, the son of cult leaders, meets an untimely end when he is sacrificed in a ritual. Instead of the afterlife, he finds himself reincarnated in a world devoid of religion, where explicit literature is as harmless as a child's scribbles. In this new world, the state holds the power over life and death. When Yukito attempts to save his friend from state-ordered execution, they both meet their end. However, at the brink of death, the goddess of his former religion appears, resurrecting them and marking the beginning of Yukito's missionary work in this godless world. This deity, who appears in the form of a young girl, turns the tide of their fate in this strange, new world.",
