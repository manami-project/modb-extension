  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After Earth was destroyed by an alien race called the Gauna, the surviving remnants of humanity fled into space aboard massive seed ships. One thousand years later in the year 3394, humanity continues its struggle to survive aboard the seed ship Sidonia. Though it's been a century since their last encounter, the threat of the shapeshifting Gauna still looms. Nagate Tanikaze has lived his entire life in isolation deep within Sidonia. When he finally emerges in search of food, he finds himself thrust into a strange new world and forced into military conscription. As luck would have it, Tanikaze's recruitment coincides with the sudden reappearance of the Gauna. Joined by his fellow soldiers Shizuka Hoshijiro, Izana Shinatose, and Yuhata Midorikawa, Tanikaze must quickly adapt to this war-driven civilization he knows so little about. As the Gauna begin their assault, it falls to Tanikaze and his friends to defend Sidonia - humanity's last beacon of hope. Over the course of the story, Tanikaze discovers the Earth-derived culture aboard Sidonia, unlocks his heroic potential, and becomes instrumental in ensuring mankind's continued survival.",
