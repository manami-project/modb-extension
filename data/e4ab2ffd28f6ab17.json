  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In early 20th century Tokyo, the ambitious sorcerer Kato aims to conquer the rapidly modernizing city by resurrecting the ancient warrior spirit Masakado using dark magic. To achieve his goal, Kato exploits Yukari, an innocent woman with latent psychic abilities, intending to sire a child through her that can challenge Masakado's power. However, Kato's scheming inadvertently awakens the legendary guardian spirit tasked with protecting Tokyo. What follows is a decades-long supernatural struggle between mystical protectors and destructive forces that engulfs the city. An unlikely team of occultists, scientists, and children finds themselves at the center of the chaos, striving to save Tokyo from ruin. Though Kato tries again with Yukari's daughter Yukiko, his plans are ultimately foiled by Keiko, an unassuming shrine maiden who wields divine power. The fate of the city hangs in the balance as this epic battle between good and evil, ancient and modern, plays out over two decades.",
