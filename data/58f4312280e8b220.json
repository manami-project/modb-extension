    "text": "Misao and Sasami, along with their friends, are not your ordinary girls; they are magical girls, secretly living among humans. Sasami, born with magical powers, has been hiding her abilities since childhood on her parents' insistence. Their lives take a turn with the arrival of a new teacher, Wajuu, who kickstarts a series of events that lead them to a summer training camp in the witch world.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of their mentor, Washu, disguised as a Cooking Club supervisor, the girls learn to control their powers and form unbreakable bonds. However, the witch world has sinister plans, testing their friendships and forcing Misao to make a choice that could change everything.\n\nWhen Misao decides to stay back in the magical world, feeling ignored and left out by her friends, she gains immense power and refuses to return, even attacking her friends when they try to save her. The truth unfolds as Misao realizes that the witches were after Sasami all along. Meanwhile, a magical being, Amitav, forms an unusual attachment to Sasami's father in the real world. Will the magical girls club overcome these challenges and save Misao? Only time will tell.",
