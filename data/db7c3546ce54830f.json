  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Although a traffic accident claimed his life, the story of a middle-aged man with a deep affinity for vending machines is far from over. Instead, he finds himself reincarnated as his most cherished object—a vending machine—in a fantastical world filled with danger and mystery. Trapped in an unfamiliar dungeon, he struggles to communicate or move, leaving him feeling hopeless and alone.\n\nHowever, when a young adventurer named Lammis discovers him, she realizes that this vending machine, now known as Boxxo, is far from ordinary. Intrigued by the goods he offers, she uses her 'Blessing of Might' to transport him back to her village, Clearflow Lake. Despite his inability to converse with the villagers, Boxxo becomes an integral part of their daily lives, providing sustenance and essential items.\n\nAs he gains new abilities and expands his product range, Boxxo becomes a beloved fixture in the community. In particular, Lammis, his first and most loyal customer, forms a unique bond with him. Inspired by her determination as a young hunter, Boxxo becomes an unlikely ally, helping her hone her skills and prepare for the challenges that lie ahead.",
