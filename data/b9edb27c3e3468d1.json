  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unable to rely on her gambling-addicted father, Nanami Momozono finds herself homeless and hungry. In an unexpected turn of events, she encounters a mysterious stranger in the park who, in gratitude for her help, bestows upon her the responsibility of a local shrine's deity. However, Nanami's new home is far from ordinary, as it is inhabited by a fox familiar named Tomoe who is less than pleased with the arrival of a human. To solidify her role as the new deity, Nanami must form a contract with Tomoe, but the thought of kissing the hot-headed fox is far from appealing.\n\nAs Nanami stumbles through her divine duties, she faces various challenges, including threats from a youkai intent on devouring her and a snake spirit who desires her hand in marriage. Amidst these trials, she discovers her burgeoning feelings for Tomoe, who, despite his initial reluctance, begins to warm up to his new goddess. Together, they must navigate the complexities of godhood and the unexpected emotions that arise between them. Will Nanami and Tomoe be able to overcome their differences and work together to maintain the shrine, or will their tumultuous relationship lead to further chaos? Only time will tell in this captivating tale of love, growth, and the supernatural.",
