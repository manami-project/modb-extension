    "text": "Byakuran, a powerful figure in China's Ming Dynasty, dispatches a ruthless group of assassins to capture a young orphan named Kotarou for a mysterious ritual that promises immortality. On the run with his loyal dog Tobimaru, Kotarou's life takes a turn when he crosses paths with Nanashi, a wandering ronin with a secret past that has led him to seal his blade. Despite his reluctance, Nanashi becomes Kotarou's protector after saving the duo from the Ming assassins, including the bloodthirsty and skilled swordsman Luo-Lang.\n\nAs the unlikely trio navigate the war-torn Japanese countryside during the Sengoku period, they face constant danger and clashing ambitions from men seeking power and glory. With each encounter, Nanashi is forced to confront his past and decide whether to unsheathe his sword once more to protect Kotarou and Tobimaru. Will Nanashi overcome his past and become the hero Kotarou needs, or will they fall victim to the Ming Dynasty's relentless pursuit?",
