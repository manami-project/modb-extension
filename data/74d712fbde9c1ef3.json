The death of Kousuke's grandfather and the impending demolition of their cherished apartment complex create a rift between the two friends, leading them to drift apart. During a fateful summer vacation, the duo and their friends decide to explore the condemned building, a place brimming with shared memories.\n\nIn the midst of their exploration, an inexplicable phenomenon occurs, and the apartment complex is mysteriously surrounded by an endless sea. The friends find themselves isolated from the rest of the world, with the old complex serving as their only sanctuary. As they struggle to comprehend their new reality, Kousuke and Natsume must confront their past and work together to find a way back home.\n\nWith the vast ocean stretching out before them, the group faces a series of trials, tears, and conflicts. As they navigate this strange new world, they may even discover the key to rekindling their once-strong friendship. Embarking on a summer journey filled with heartache and hope, the friends must rely on each other to overcome the challenges that lie ahead and find their way back to their previous lives.",
