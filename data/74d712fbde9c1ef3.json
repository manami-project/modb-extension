    "text": "Kousuke and Natsume were the best of friends growing up together in the same apartment building. But when Kousuke's grandfather passed away, he became more distant. Now in sixth grade, their friendship has frayed. During summer break, Kousuke and his friends sneak into their old apartment complex, scheduled for demolition. To their surprise, Natsume is there too. After an argument over an old camera that stirs up bitter memories, a bizarre phenomenon occurs - the building is suddenly surrounded by a vast ocean! Now Kousuke, Natsume and the others must band together as the apartment drifts aimlessly at sea. Putting aside their differences won't be easy. But they'll have to reconcile their past in order to face this uncertain future. New tears and fights await them. Their only chance to return home lies in reforging fractured bonds before it's too late. Can they overcome old wounds to work as one? Or will this farewell journey spell the end for Kousuke and Natsume's childhood friendship?",
