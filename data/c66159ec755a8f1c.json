  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Though Ishiyama High is notorious for its delinquent population and rampant lawlessness, one first-year student reigns supreme above all others: Tatsumi Oga. Known for his formidable strength and ruthless reputation, Oga's life takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a mysterious baby while fishing by the river. This baby, named Kaiser de Emperana Beelzebub IV or 'Baby Beel,' is the son of the Demon Lord himself.\n\nWith Baby Beel forming an immediate attachment to Oga, the young delinquent finds himself entrusted with the responsibility of raising the future Lord of the Underworld. Aided by Hildegard, Beel's demon maid, Oga must navigate the challenges of parenthood while maintaining his position as the most feared student at Ishiyama High.\n\nSurrounded by fellow delinquents and the supernatural forces at play, Oga's newfound role as a caretaker may prove to be his most daunting challenge yet. Can he balance his delinquent lifestyle with his duties as Beel's guardian, or will the forces of darkness and diaper changes ultimately prove to be too much for this unlikely duo? Join Oga and Baby Beel as they embark on a chaotic and comedic journey filled with action, friendship, and more than a few demonic encounters.",
