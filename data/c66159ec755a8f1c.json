  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ishiyama High School is notorious for being full of violent delinquents, with constant fighting being the norm. Tatsumi Oga, a first-year student, is considered the most vicious fighter at the school. One day while Oga is by a riverbed, he sees a strange man floating downstream. When Oga retrieves the man from the water, he splits open to reveal a baby inside. This is no ordinary infant - it is Kaiser de Emperana Beelzebub IV, the son of the Demon Lord himself. Nicknamed \"Baby Beel\", the child immediately becomes attached to Oga and refuses to leave his side. He is also joined by Hildegard, Beelzebub's personal demon maid, who helps care for the baby. Now, in addition to asserting his strength among Ishiyama's delinquents, Oga must take on the unexpected role of raising the future Lord of the Underworld. Surrounded by violence and demonic powers, parenting Baby Beel proves to be Oga's most chaotic challenge yet.",
