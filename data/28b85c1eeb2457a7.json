    "text": "Family In ancient China, a member of the Yinyang Family bore witness to the tragic burning of Epang Palace and the loss of countless scholars under the order of Qin Shihuang. To preserve their knowledge and skills, he transformed the scholars' spirits into brushes, ensuring their legacy would live on. Fast forward to the present day, Luo Zhongxia, an unassuming college student, stumbles upon one of these brushes containing the spirit of the great poet Li Bai, bestowing him with incredible powers. However, Luo Zhongxia's newfound abilities attract unwanted attention from various forces, placing him in constant peril. In an attempt to evade these dangers, Luo Zhongxia embarks on a quest to return the brush, but his efforts are repeatedly thwarted. Instead, he finds himself entwined with the fates of seven brush spirits known as the 'Seven Lords of Guancheng'. As Luo Zhongxia navigates this extraordinary world, he evolves from a naive student into a responsible and strategic 'pen tomb official'.",
