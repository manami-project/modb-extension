  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It begins with \"X2: Double X,\" a concise prelude to the feature-length film \"X,\" spanning a brief two minutes and forty seconds. This animated short is part of a quartet of music videos, with the first three showcasing stills from CLAMP's pre-1994 \"X\" artwork and live-action sequences. The fourth video, animated by Madhouse, stands out as the only one with a narrative. It swiftly introduces key characters and condenses the initial story arcs from the \"X\" manga, mirroring the events of the first three episodes in the TV series, all leading up to the theatrical movie.",
