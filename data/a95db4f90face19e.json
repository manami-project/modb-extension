    "text": "After Kyosuke extends an invitation to his crush, Madoka, for a beach getaway in Okinawa, their friends Yuusaku, Hikaru, and Kazuya unexpectedly join them. Despite initial plans for separate accommodations, the group finds themselves sharing close quarters. Amidst the chaos, Kyosuke sees an opportunity to express his true feelings to Madoka when they find themselves trapped in a seaside cave due to Kazuya's unpredictable abilities. However, the situation proves less than ideal for a romantic confession. This heartwarming and comedic pilot film, titled \"Kimagure Orange Road (1985),\" explores the complexities of young love and sets the stage for a potential series.",
