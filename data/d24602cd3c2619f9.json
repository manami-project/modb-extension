    "text": "Ayumi, Chihiro, Elsie, and Mieko form a rock band with dreams of stardom, but their music leaves much to be desired. Eager to improve, they take Elsie's suggestion to establish a light music club and secure a dedicated practice space. However, their school's strict teacher, Kodama-sensei, poses a challenge: they must achieve perfect scores on their next English exam to form the club.\n\nJust as the girls are about to lose hope, the famous idol Kanon arrives, inspiring a newfound determination. Kanon, thrilled by her classmates' musical interests, reveals she'll be the guest star at the upcoming Mai-High dance festival. Seizing the opportunity, Chihiro declares her band will compete against Kanon. But with the daunting task of acing their exams and limited practice time, can the girls rise to the challenge? Luckily, a perfect-scoring deity is ready to keep a promise and help them succeed.",
