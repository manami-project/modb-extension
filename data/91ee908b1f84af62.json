    "text": "Nowa is a bear living alone in a remote forest, until one day he finds an abandoned puppy named Airi. Nowa takes Airi in and raises him as his own. When winter comes, Nowa goes into hibernation, as bears do. While Nowa sleeps through the cold months, Airi grows from a puppy into an adult dog. Come spring, Nowa awakens to find Airi eagerly awaiting him, overjoyed to see his adoptive father again. The two share an affectionate reunion, with Airi expressing his longing for Nowa by tenderly caressing his chest. Thus begins a curious relationship between a bear and a dog, unlikely companions brought together by fate in the secluded forest. Their future days promise to be filled with the singular joys and challenges of interspecies friendship.",
