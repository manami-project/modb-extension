    "text": "Kise's 'Perfect Copy' ability and Seirin's determination to overcome it take center stage in the second compilation film of the Kuroko no Basket franchise. In the quarterfinals of the Winter Cup, Seirin must first face off against Yosen's formidable defense, led by Murasakibara, one of Kuroko's former teammates from the 'Generation of Miracles'. Kuroko scores his first point against the impenetrable defense, while Kagami and Himuro's intense rivalry reaches new heights. The stakes are high as Seirin battles to secure a victory.\n\nIn the semi-finals, Seirin faces off against their old rivals, Kaijo High, and another of Kuroko's former teammates, Ryouta Kise. Seirin works tirelessly to take the lead, but Kise's 'Perfect Copy' ability proves to be a major obstacle. Just when Seirin thinks they have a chance after Kise is benched due to a leg injury, Kaijo shows them that they're still a force to be reckoned with. The intense battle on the court will leave fans on the edge of their seats.",
