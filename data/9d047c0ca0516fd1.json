    "text": "While the world remains oblivious to the existence of demons, exorcists like Rin Okumura continue their secret battle against these malevolent entities. After a brief period of tranquility following the defeat of the Impure King, Rin's classmate Godaiin suddenly gains the ability to see demons, disrupting the fragile peace. As Rin investigates, he discovers that this strange occurrence may be linked to the devil's growing influence in the human realm of Assiah. Meanwhile, the True Cross Academy faces an escalating threat as the Illuminati, a powerful and enigmatic organization, constructs an artificial gate to the demonic realm of Gehenna. While Rin and his fellow students prepare for their Exorcist Certification Exam, they remain unaware that the Illuminati has infiltrated their ranks, placing spies among the very exorcists sworn to protect humanity. As the boundary between the human and demonic realms becomes increasingly unclear, Rin and his friends must rise to the challenge and confront the looming darkness.",
