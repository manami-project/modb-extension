    "text": "They say the third time's the charm, but for humanity, it was a curse. In the wake of a devastating interplanetary war, only a fifth of the population survived, leaving behind a desolate world ruled by a mysterious new breed of humans known as 'The Third.' Equipped with a third eye, these beings possess extraordinary abilities to manipulate technology, making them the dominant force in this post-apocalyptic future.\n\nEnter Honoka, a versatile and skilled swordswoman who's made a name for herself by taking on any job that doesn't involve murder. Alongside her AI-powered tank, Bogie, she navigates the remnants of civilization, avoiding conflict unless absolutely necessary. However, when she stumbles upon a young man named Ikus in the unforgiving desert, her life takes an unexpected turn.\n\nRescuing Ikus from a perilous situation, Honoka finds herself drawn into his world, accepting a job that piques the interest of the powerful Thirds. As they embark on this adventure together, the duo discovers that the Thirds' fascination with Ikus is far from ordinary. Little do they know, this is only the beginning of Honoka's extraordinary journey.",
