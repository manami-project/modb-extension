  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rakugo, a traditional form of Japanese comic theater, is kept alive by five young women with distinct personalities and interests in the anime \"Joshiraku.\" Marii, Kigurumi, Tetora, Gankyou, and Kukuru are dedicated to mastering this challenging art form, where a single performer tells an entire story using only voice changes and minimal movements. When they're not on stage, they engage in humorous and satirical conversations about everyday life, from politics to manga, and everything in between. Each discussion leads to unexpected and amusing conclusions, far from the original topic. These unique friendships extend beyond the theater, as they explore Tokyo and encounter a mysterious stranger wearing a wrestling mask. Join these talented Rakugo performers as they navigate the world, sharing their wit, humor, and observations with each other and their audience.",
