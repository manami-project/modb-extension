  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seven is an assassin with a mysterious past, suffering from amnesia and living a double life on a small island. By day, he runs a modest hair salon with his feathered friend Dai Bo. By night, he carries out assassinations, charging only 567 yuan per hit despite his lethal skills. Possessing versatile transformation abilities that allow him to disguise himself flawlessly, Seven can seamlessly slip in and out of any setting undetected. However, his signature technique involves using telekinetic scissors with deadly precision. While clearly capable, Seven surprisingly struggles to complete his assassination missions. His kindness and reluctance to kill often sabotage his contracts. Still, these jobs serve a singular purpose for Seven - to repay his debts and inch closer towards recovering his lost memories. Between running the salon, his assassination side hustle, and chasing every lead towards his past, Seven leads an interconnected web of lives. As he takes each step forward, the mysteries behind the man he once was continue to unfold.",
