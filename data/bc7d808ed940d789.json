  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On an unassuming island, Wu Liuqi, a forgetful assassin with a knack for shape-shifting, runs a humble hair salon alongside his feathered companion, Dai Bo. Despite his intimidating appearance and unique abilities, including telekinetic scissor techniques, Wu's performance in his side job as a contract killer is less than stellar. Often mistakenly targeting the wrong individuals or bungling his missions, Wu's heart doesn't quite align with his line of work.\n\nHowever, these odd jobs serve a greater purpose: to repay his debts and, hopefully, unlock the secrets of his forgotten past. As Wu navigates through his dual life as a hairdresser and assassin, his adventures seem to weave a tapestry that leads him closer to his lost memories. Despite his struggles, Wu's journey is a testament to his resilience and his unyielding quest to rediscover his true identity.",
