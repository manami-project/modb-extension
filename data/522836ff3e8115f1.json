    "text": "The narrative unfolds in Hokkaido, 1991, where a chain of mysterious murders coincides with the sudden emergence of dragons in the sky. The Japanese Self-Defense Forces (SDF) promptly blame the dragons and initiate a ruthless campaign to eliminate them. Amidst this chaos, a young, troubled girl is entrusted with the responsibility of nurturing a baby dragon, with the ultimate intention of raising it for destruction. As the story progresses, the true perpetrators of the murders will be unveiled, and the reason behind the dragons' appearance will become clear.\n\nAt the heart of this tale is an extraordinary bond between a young girl and a young dragon. Despite their profound connection, the world around them is hostile, forcing them to ally with those who have always been against them, especially when malevolent demons threaten their existence.\n\nSpanning hundreds of years, the story follows the life of Carmine, a dragon who witnesses the brutal murder of his mother and closest friends, as well as the devastation caused by invading demons. Despite these hardships, Carmine finds solace in the company of young women who capture his heart. As he navigates through the centuries, watching the world evolve around him, Carmine remains steadfast in his vow to protect the world from those who seek its destruction.",
