  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuzuki Eba, a teenage girl from Tokyo, moves to the countryside to live with the family of Haruto Kirishima, an acquaintance of her father's, to attend high school there. Despite Haruto's initial objections, Yuzuki moves into his home. Over time, Haruto develops feelings for Yuzuki, but she eventually moves back to Tokyo unexpectedly. Still holding onto his feelings, Haruto later moves to Tokyo himself under the pretense of pursuing a culinary career, when in fact he hopes to reconnect with Yuzuki. However, Yuzuki continues to avoid Haruto without explanation. As Haruto tries to understand why and potentially win her back, he befriends his sister's neighbor Mishima Asuka, who had first mistaken Haruto for an intruder. Haruto grapples with lingering affections for both Yuzuki and his high school crush Nanami Kanzaki, while also building a new connection with Asuka. He strives to uncover the truth about Yuzuki's abrupt departure and her reasons for now distancing herself from him after they had grown so close. All the while, Haruto contemplates how far he is willing to go for love and whether he should try to rekindle a seemingly lost romance or move forward.",
