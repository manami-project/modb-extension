    "text": "Would you dare to defy the rules for love? In a near-future Japan, the government takes the guesswork out of romance by assigning marriage partners to 16-year-olds, boosting birth rates and eliminating the need for courtship. For Yukari Nejima, an average teenager with a hidden passionate heart, this system turns his world upside down when he confesses his love to his longtime crush, Misaki, only to find out he's been assigned to someone else â€“ Ririna Sanada.\n\nAs love and lies intertwine, Yukari, Misaki, and Ririna find themselves in a complex web of emotions and forbidden relationships. With strict punishments for those who stray from their assigned partners, Yukari must navigate the delicate balance between following his heart and adhering to the rules. Will he choose the love he's always desired or embrace the life the government has chosen for him? Dive into a world where love is a risk, and the truth could cost everything.",
