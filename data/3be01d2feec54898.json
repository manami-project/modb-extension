  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Born and raised in the tranquil Japanese countryside, Hinako Sakuragi carries a unique charm that attracts animals but struggles to communicate effectively with people, leaving her as silent and still as a scarecrow. Determined to break free from her timid nature, Hinako moves to the lively city of Tokyo to attend Fujiyama High School, with dreams of joining a theater club to improve her speech and express herself more freely.\n\nUpon her arrival, she discovers that her new home, Hitotose Manor, is actually a secondhand bookstore, inhabited by an unusual girl with a peculiar appetite for books. To Hinako's dismay, she learns that the theater club at her school has been inactive for quite some time.\n\nFeeling discouraged but still eager to learn about theater, Hinako receives unexpected support from Chiaki Hagino, the landlady of Hitotose Manor. Chiaki encourages her to form a new theater troupe with the manor's residents. As Hinako embarks on this new journey, she will discover the magic of theater, friendship, and self-growth in the heart of Tokyo.",
