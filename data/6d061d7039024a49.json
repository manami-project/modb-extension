    "text": "The Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba specials center around unique spin-off stories featuring the characters from the popular anime series. Originally performed live in Tokyo by the voice cast in 2019, these specials were later released on DVD/Blu-Ray in 2020 with updated voice recordings. One special welcomes viewers to Kimetsu Academy, a comedic take on the characters in a high school setting. Another offers a behind-the-scenes look into the live dubbing event with the talented voice actors. Though varied in tone and format, the specials ultimately provide entertaining new adventures for dedicated fans while offering a glimpse into the playful camaraderie of the voice cast bringing these beloved characters to life. Those looking for bonus content expanding on the rich Demon Slayer world will find these specials a treat worth checking out.",
