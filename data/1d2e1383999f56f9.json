  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tomoya Aki is an otaku high school student who dreams of creating his own visual novel game that can touch people's hearts. One day, he has a fateful encounter with his boring classmate Megumi Kato amidst beautiful cherry blossoms. Inspired by her looks, Tomoya decides to model his game's heroine after Megumi and transform her into the ultimate dream girl. To bring his vision to life, Tomoya recruits his half-foreigner childhood friend Eriri Spencer Sawamura, a talented artist, and the renowned literary genius Utaha Kasumigaoka. Though initially skeptical of using the docile Megumi as the inspiration, Tomoya's eccentric team comes together to develop the game. However, they soon realize that to write a story that can truly move players, they must draw from their own intertwined experiences of love, friendship, and creativity. Fueled by their passion for anime and games, Tomoya and his friends now endeavor to create a heartfelt visual novel while also navigating complex relationships and budding feelings for each other.",
