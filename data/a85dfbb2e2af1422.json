    "text": "Tianlanzong, a prestigious sect, once reigned supreme in the cultivation realm, boasting an array of prodigious disciples. Among them was Xu Yang, the founding disciple, who, despite his early promise, found himself trapped in the Qi refining stage while his peers ascended to greater heights. Determined to break through, Xu Yang secluded himself for a staggering ten thousand years. Upon his emergence, he discovered a drastically altered world; the once-mighty Tianlanzong teetered on the brink of extinction, its disciple count dwindling to a mere handful.\n\nUndeterred by the passage of time and the decline of his sect, Xu Yang resolved to restore Tianlanzong to its former glory. He faced and overcame formidable adversaries, vowing to rebuild the sect from the ashes. As the sect's influence began to expand, the enigma surrounding Xu Yang's stagnant cultivation unraveled, revealing a secret deeply entwined with the realms of humans, demons, and immortals.\n\nThe fate of the world now rests in Xu Yang's hands, as he stands on the precipice of a choice: to become a god with a single thought or to descend into darkness as a devil. The life and death of the world hinge on his decision, making Xu Yang's journey a thrilling tale of power, resilience, and the pursuit of redemption.",
