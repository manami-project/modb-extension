  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One sunny day in a quaint Japanese town, three young neighbors—Kaori, a dungaree-clad tomboy, and her friends Ko and Yasu—stumble upon an injured pigeon. Taking it upon themselves to nurse the bird back to health, their peaceful lives are soon disrupted when a US Phantom jet roars overhead, plummeting to the ground near the boys' home. Drawing inspiration from the real-life event of the 1977 Yokohama F-4 crash, \"Papa Mama Bye Bye\" weaves a tale of friendship and unexpected turmoil, as the unannounced emergency landing shakes the tranquility of the town and stirs unrest among the Japanese civilians.",
