  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Papa Mama Bye Bye is an anime that depicts the dramatic events surrounding an actual historical incident from 1977, when a US Phantom jet made an emergency landing in the middle of Yokohama, Japan. The story follows Kaori, a teenage tomboy who wears dungarees and lives next door to two brothers named Ko and Yasu. One day while Kaori is walking to school, a US military jet suddenly crashes near the brothers' house, mirroring the real-life Yokohama incident. Though sparse on details, the multiple synopses make clear that Papa Mama Bye Bye aims to dramatize this unsettling crash that caused unrest among Japanese civilians. Centered around youthful characters who witness the chaotic incident firsthand, the anime seems poised to examine its emotional impact on their community. With a premise based in historical reality, Papa Mama Bye Bye promises to offer a dramatic perspective on an infamously disruptive moment in time. Kaori and her young neighbors may provide an intimate lens into how the crisis affected Japanese citizens on an individual level.",
