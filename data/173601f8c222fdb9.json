  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The demons of Hell face a dire threat from the invading army of angels. In a desperate bid to turn the tide, demon Masatora Akutsu is sent to Earth to recruit a charismatic leader capable of motivating the demon forces. Disguised as a high school student, Akutsu sets his sights on the popular and kind Lily Amane, believing she would make the perfect inspirational figurehead. But he soon discovers that Lily has been hiding a shocking secret - she is actually an angel, sent to eliminate demons! With their missions at odds, Lily and Akutsu become locked in a battle of wits and wills. Rather than destroying him immediately, Lily decides to try reforming the wayward demon, while Akutsu seeks to corrupt the angel to the demon cause. As they spend more time together, their growing feelings for each other threaten to undermine their respective duties. Can sworn enemies find common ground? The fate of two worlds hangs in the balance as angel and demon play a dangerous game on the battlefield and in each other's hearts.",
