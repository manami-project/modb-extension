  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shy elementary school student Tsubasa's life is dramatically changed when she stumbles upon a crashed alien spacecraft belonging to an intergalactic police force. The aliens, led by Agent DD, were transporting dangerous bio-weapon creatures called Magyua, but some have escaped during the crash. Seeing the threat these violent Magyua pose to Earth, DD enlists Tsubasa's help by granting her a battlesuit called Figure 17 that fuses with Tsubasa's body. Together, they can unite into a powerful bio-humanoid weapon. Though hesitant at first, Tsubasa finds a new confidence in her superhero alter ego. With the Magyua invasion underway, Tsubasa must harness her newly awakened courage to master the Figure 17 battlesuit's abilities. Only by working alongside DD and the aliens can she hope to protect her home from the Magyua menace. Overcoming her shyness is the key not only to saving the world, but also discovering the hero within.",
