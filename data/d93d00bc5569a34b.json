  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After 7 years away, Yuuichi Aizawa returns to his childhood town to live with his aunt Akiko while his parents work in Africa. Though the town is familiar, Yuuichi's memories of his time there have mysteriously vanished. Even his cousin Nayuki, whom he used to play with often, now seems like a stranger. On the day he moves into his new home, Yuuichi discovers a red headband that triggers fragments of forgotten memories - broken promises, buried secrets, and fateful encounters with various girls in the town. As more glimpses of the past resurface, Yuuichi senses something supernatural at work. Why did these memories disappear in the first place? What really happened during his childhood years? The answers may reveal hidden dimensions to not only Yuuichi's own past, but also the lives of those closest to him. This anime promises emotional depth in charting the renewal of dormant relationships. With traces of mystery and the supernatural, it also hints at shadowy events underlying the tranquil snow-covered streets of Yuuichi's childhood town. As he reconnects with the girls there, deeper secrets may come to light.",
