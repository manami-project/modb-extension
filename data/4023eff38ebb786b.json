  "synopsis": {
    "text": "All is not as it seems in our world, as mythical creatures of the night known as Darkstalkers secretly hold sway over humanity. From bloodthirsty vampires and ferocious werewolves to enchanting succubi and reanimated zombies, these powerful beings engage in relentless battles to prove their dominance. Amidst this chaos, an ancient vampire king, Demitri Maximoff, emerges after a century-long absence, seeking to reclaim his lost power.\n\nMeanwhile, a diverse group of Darkstalkers pursue their own ambitions, such as the thrill-seeking succubus princess Morrigan, an undead rockstar, and a resilient cat-girl named Felicia striving to overcome human prejudice. As these legendary creatures clash, an unexpected threat looms: an extraterrestrial force led by the solar god Pyron and an army of Aztec-inspired robots, the Huitzil, target Earth for conquest.\n\nWith humanity hanging in the balance, the Darkstalkers must set aside their differences and forge an unlikely alliance to protect the very world they have plunged into darkness. As the ultimate battle unfolds, both humans and Darkstalkers must unite to save their planet from the brink of destruction.",
