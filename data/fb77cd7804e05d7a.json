  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mizuki's life is a complex tapestry of pain and hope, woven against the backdrop of a snowy Christmas season. Living in a large, solitary house next to university student Fujioka Junsho, Mizuki carries the weight of a traumatic past that has left her with a skewed perspective on life and an inability to trust others. As she grapples with her own demons, she finds herself unexpectedly drawn to her neighbor, Junsho. Meanwhile, Nobumasa, a part-time worker at a shoe store, crosses paths with Mizuki, unaware of the turmoil that lies beneath her surface. Simultaneously, Nobumasa remains oblivious to the affection harbored by another girl, Seiko, who struggles to express her feelings. As the snow falls and Christmas approaches, an incident unfolds, gradually unraveling Mizuki's past and revealing the reasons behind her deep-seated hatred for the festive season. This poignant anime delves into the intricate depths of its characters, offering a sensitive exploration of their emotional journeys that may resonate with viewers long after the final scene.",
