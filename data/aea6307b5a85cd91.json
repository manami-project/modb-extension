As the two men form an unexpected bond, Ranmaru's life takes a dramatic turn, filled with power struggles, family obligations, and a burgeoning romance that transcends cultural boundaries. When their paths cross again in Italy, Ranmaru and Al embark on a passionate love story that promises to be as thrilling as it is unforgettable.",
