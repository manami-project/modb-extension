  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Slayer Tanjirou and his comrades find themselves in a desperate situation as they face off against the formidable siblings, Daki and Gyuutarou, in the Entertainment District Arc of \"Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba.\" Despite seemingly cutting off Daki's head, the battle is far from over as Gyuutarou arrives and deals a devastating blow to Inosuke, leaving Tanjirou trapped under debris and his allies gravely injured. However, the group refuses to give up and rallies to turn the tide of the battle. The outcome of this destructive confrontation is uncertain, and the demon king Muzan's reaction to the events is yet to be seen. The story continues in the Swordsmith Village Arc, where Tanjirou's stay promises new challenges and mysteries to uncover. This feature-length cut includes episodes 10 and 11 of the Entertainment District Arc and an extended episode 1 of the Swordsmith Village Arc, all presented in stunning 4K with remastered audio.",
