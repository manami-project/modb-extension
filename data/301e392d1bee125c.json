  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in the year 2301, the anime follows Akari Mizunashi, a cheerful 15-year-old girl who travels from Earth to the terraformed planet of Aqua (formerly Mars). Upon arriving in the stunning aquatic city of Neo-Venezia, a replica of Venice, Akari begins training to become a gondolier like her mentor Alicia Florence. As Akari explores the town's picturesque canals and encounters its friendly locals, she has a series of heartwarming adventures. In her free time, she strolls the streets with her feline friend President Aria, discovering wonders like hanging laundry and waterside cafes. Though Akari relishes these simple pleasures, her training remains rigorous under Alicia's expert guidance. Along the way, Akari befriends several fellow gondolier trainees like the stoic Aika and precocious Alice while aiming to join the ranks of Neo-Venezia's top gondoliers, known as the three Water Fairies. With a little luck and a lot of hard work, this eager girl just may make her dream come true. Overflowing with magic and miracles, Aqua is the perfect place for Akari to begin the next chapter of her life.",
