  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In ancient times, the great Mother spirit created two races - demons and guardians - to populate the earth alongside humans. The demons were intended to be mankind's arch enemies and challenge them, while the noble guardians were tasked with protecting humans. Over time, these three races battled for control of the earth. In present-day Neo-Shinjuku, few demons or guardians remain. A mysterious light has destroyed part of the city, and horrific murders are taking place. The lone remaining guardian is Tsunami Shijyo, an ancient warrior who once again must battle the demons to save humanity from enslavement. The supreme demon leader who has survived since ancient times is plotting to subjugate humans once more. Tsunami gets involved with a woman who has lost her fianc√© and her arm in the mysterious events overtaking the city. Together, they seek to understand the threats facing Neo-Shinjuku and why these tragedies have occurred. Tsunami stands as the last line of defense against the rising demonic threat. She must fight against evil and corruption to stop the demons' dark plans, or mankind will be enslaved under demon rule forever. The very fate of the human race hangs in the balance.",
