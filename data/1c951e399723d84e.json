  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ooyama, the director of a private company named 'Eternal Earth,' and Professor Hikawa collaborate with the United Nations to create an artificial jungle, aiming to preserve nature and safeguard endangered animals. This utopia, managed by advanced technology, becomes the new home for all wild animals. Leo, a white lion cub, is born into this man-made paradise. As the son of Panja, the reigning jungle emperor, Leo struggles to live up to his father's legacy. His gentle nature, poor hunting skills, and fear of jumping over crevices make him the target of ridicule among the other animals.\n\nLeo's life takes a turn when he encounters Kenichi, Ooyama's son, who possesses the unique ability to communicate with animals. Despite being surrounded by skepticism, Kenichi is confident about the neo-jungle's success. As Leo and Kenichi's paths cross, the young lion finds support in Koko, a female bird who believes in him. Determined to prove himself, Leo embarks on a journey to become the jungle emperor he was destined to be, with Kenichi by his side.",
