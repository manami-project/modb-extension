  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fable is a legendary hitman who has completed numerous high-profile assassinations. However, his extraordinary talent has drawn unwanted attention. To lay low, his boss orders Fable to assume a false identity and live as an ordinary citizen for one year, accompanied by his female driver posing as his sister. Fable is warned that he faces severe punishment if he kills anyone during his sabbatical from contract killing. Now living as Akira Satou, Fable struggles to adapt to regular life without utilizing his lethal skills. His driver and fake sister Youko helps keep Fable's violent impulses in check. Though accustomed to easily carrying out hits, Fable faces his most difficult job yet - being a normal person who cannot kill. This year-long suspension tests whether the genius killer can blend into society.",
