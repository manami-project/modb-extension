    "text": "Majima Jin, a human with a deep-seated dislike for animals, finds himself surrounded by them at Seton Academy, a unique institution where diverse species gather to learn and grow together. In this wild and unpredictable environment, Jin crosses paths with Ranka Okami, a lone wolf yearning for companionship. Despite Jin's initial reluctance to befriend the animals he despises, he forms an unexpected bond with Ranka and meets Hitomi Hino, a fellow human who captures his heart. Together, they form a cooking club, attracting a vibrant mix of members, including a cheerful koala, a laid-back sloth, and a feisty feline. As they navigate their differences and learn valuable lessons about friendship, Jin and his motley crew embark on a hilarious and heartwarming adventure that transcends species boundaries.",
