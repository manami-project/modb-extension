They attend an intensive training camp organized by their rival Nekoma High, along with other top schools. However, Karasuno continues to struggle and lose in practice matches. The losses take a toll on ace spiker Hinata and genius setter Kageyama. Their signature quick attack falters as they fall out of sync.
