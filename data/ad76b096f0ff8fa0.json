    "text": "Juna Ariyoshi is an ordinary high school girl whose life is changed after a tragic motorcycle accident. At the brink of death, she is given a second chance at life by Chris Hawken and tasked with saving the planet from destructive forces called the Raaja. These Raaja are born from pollution and environmental damage caused by careless human activity. With her newfound powers as the Avatar of Time, Juna must overcome her own flaws and destructive tendencies in order to master abilities that connect her to the Earth. She gains insight into how all aspects of nature are interconnected and how mankind’s disregard for the environment has pushed the planet to the brink. Juna embarks on her destiny alongside allies like Chris, his assistant Cindy, and the organization SEED. She faces the monumental challenge of stopping the Raaja from taking over and destroying the world she loves. Along the way, she finds answers to deep questions about the human relationship with science, technology and nature. Though unsure of herself at first, Juna summons the courage to fight for Earth’s future and unlock the full potential of her powers. Hers is a coming-of-age story about finding purpose by taking responsibility for one's actions towards our shared home.",
