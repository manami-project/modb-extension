To uncover the truth, Anos must journey into the mysterious spirit world, undergoing difficult trials. With unmatched power and confidence, Anos readies to battle formidable foes to protect his realm. Though they boast grand titles, none can rival the true Demon King of Tyranny.

Backed by steadfast allies, Anos heads into the unknown to confront this menacing new adversary. While once merciless, he now understands restraint. But if provoked, his tyrannical wrath remains undimmed by time's passage. Anos again overcomes all odds in an epic struggle between demon kings and deities.",
