    "text": "Laika, the dragon, and Halkara, the elf, are not the only ones knocking on Azusa's door after rumors of the \"Witch of the Plateau's\" incredible strength spread far and wide. Azusa, once an overworked office employee, is reincarnated as an immortal witch in a new world, where she seeks a life of tranquility and simplicity. To make ends meet, she spends centuries hunting slimes, the weakest of creatures, only to unintentionally amass enough experience points to reach the maximum level. As Azusa's peaceful existence is disrupted by adventurers and powerful beings seeking to challenge or enlist her, she must navigate her newfound fame and power while trying to preserve the serene life she has built for herself. With a colorful cast of characters and a touch of comedy, this anime explores the unexpected consequences of Azusa's quest for a stress-free life.",
