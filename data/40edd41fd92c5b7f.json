  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Garann robots loom over Japan as the year 2019 unfolds, marking the beginning of an alternate reality that halts the arrival of the Reiwa era. A dimensional rift opens the gateway to Shinkoku Nippon, a militaristic parallel world trapped in an Eternal Showa era. Wielding powerful Genmu gas weapons, the invaders swiftly conquer Japan, leaving its once-thriving manga, anime, and idol subcultures on the brink of extinction under heavy censorship.\n\nAs the nation transforms into Genkoku Nippon, a puppet state ruled by the occupying forces, hope flickers in the shadows. In the back alleys of Akihabara, a secret alliance of female otakus and pilots emerge, determined to resist the oppressive regime. Among them is Hosomichi Kudou, who joins their fight to reclaim their beloved Japan from the clutches of Shinkoku Nippon.\n\nThe stage is set for a courageous stand against overwhelming odds, as this group of unlikely heroes challenges the occupation and strives to revive the subcultures that once defined their nation.",
