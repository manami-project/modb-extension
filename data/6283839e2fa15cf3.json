    "text": "As a high school student, Kyo Sogoru's life revolves around his love for swimming and his desperate attempts to keep the school's swimming club afloat. His mundane existence takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a mysterious girl, Shizuno Misaki, at the pool. This encounter reveals a hidden world where alien beings, known as GARDS-ORM, are threatening humanity's existence.\n\nKyo is thrust into a war he never knew existed, piloting a mecha as part of the resistance force, Celebrum, to combat these alien invaders. His reality becomes a blur as he struggles to balance his high school life with his newfound role as a mecha pilot, often questioning his sanity and the nature of his reality.\n\nThe line between reality and fantasy blurs further as Kyo experiences déjà vu while piloting the mecha, leading him to question if he has lived this life before. As he navigates this strange new world, Kyo must confront the possibility that the truth about his reality might be more than he can handle. Will he be able to save humanity and his beloved hometown, or will the truth destroy him?",
