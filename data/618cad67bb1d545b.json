  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It has been one year since the downfall of the legendary Band of the Hawk. Once revered as heroes who saved the Kingdom of Midland, they now live as fugitives after their leader, Griffith, was imprisoned for treason. When Guts suddenly returns after a long absence, it sparks hope of rescuing Griffith, who has endured horrific torture that has left him mutilated and mute. However, freeing Griffith only leads to more misfortune. Upon regaining the mystical Behelit artifact, Griffith triggers an apocalyptic transformation as the fifth member of the demonic God Hand. What follows is a nightmare of unimaginable violence as legions of monsters descend, massacring the Band of the Hawk. From the ashes of this tragedy, the stage is set for Guts to embark on a bleak and bloody journey of vengeance against the friend who betrayed him and the dark forces controlling his fate. But greater threats loom ahead that will push Guts to his physical and emotional breaking point.",
