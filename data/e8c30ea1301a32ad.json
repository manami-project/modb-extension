  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two years after Cloud Strife and his allies defeated Sephiroth and saved the planet from destruction by Meteor, the world is still recovering. The city of Midgar lies in ruins, but its survivors have established a new settlement called Edge. Here, Cloud runs a delivery service while caring for his childhood friend Tifa's adopted daughter Marlene and an orphan named Denzel. However, a mysterious illness called Geostigma is spreading among the children of Edge. At the same time, a trio of silver-haired men led by Kadaj seek to resurrect Sephiroth using the remains of Jenova. They begin abducting Geostigma-infected children for unknown reasons. To rescue the children and protect his makeshift family, Cloud reunites with his old friends from AVALANCHE - Tifa, Barret, Cid, and the others. Together, they stand against Kadaj's group and the shadow of Sephiroth in an effort to defend their city and save the children from further harm. This final battle will force Cloud to confront the trauma of his past once again. But with his trusted allies and found family by his side, he finds the strength to reclaim his sense of self and become the hero needed to take down these threats - both old and new. The bonds of friendship and community emerge as the lasting hope for a better future beyond the ruins of the past.",
