  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 5100, humanity has colonized the entire solar system and occupies facilities on planets and moons. This expansion leads to the creation of a large-scale athletic competition called the \"Daiundoukai\". Aspiring female athletes from across the galaxy gather to compete, with the winner crowned the \"Cosmo Beauty\" and granted queen-like status. The story follows Kanata Akehoshi, an outgoing potato farmer from Earth. As a child, Kanata witnessed a mysterious girl crash land in a spaceship nearby. The dying girl gave Kanata two wristbands and asked her to compete in the Daiundoukai and become the Cosmo Beauty. Although the girl vanished without a trace, Kanata vowed to fulfill her request. After winning the qualifying round to represent Earth, Kanata travels to the University Satellite to train alongside other Daiundoukai candidates. There she befriends her talented but very different fellow competitors, including a lunar refugee, the daughter of an arms dealer, and a loner. United by their drive to excel, the girls put aside their rivalries and help each other prepare for the games. As Kanata gets closer to victory, she also inches nearer to solving the mystery of the vanished girl who set her on this path. But shadowy secrets underlie the glittering facade of the Daiundoukai competition.",
