    "text": "Akabane and Shiota, once students of the infamous Assassination Classroom, find themselves back in their old classroom, reminiscing about their unconventional teacher, Koro Sensei, and the extraordinary events that shaped their time at Kunugigaoka Junior High School. As they walk through the familiar halls, they recall the day when a tentacled, yellow alien stepped into their lives, challenging them to assassinate him before he destroyed the Earth. Through the eyes of these two top students, we relive the laughter, tears, and suspense that filled their days as they trained to become assassins. Despite the unusual circumstances, the bond between teacher and students grew stronger with each passing day. Now, they can't help but wonder if their beloved teacher is truly gone forever. Join Nagisa and Karma as they journey back in time, revisiting the memories that transformed them from ordinary students into skilled assassins, and discover the lasting impact Koro Sensei had on their lives.",
