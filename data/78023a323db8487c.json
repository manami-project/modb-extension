  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Club members of Kitanohashi High School, armed with magic and determination, find themselves as humanity's unlikely heroes when a colossal alien bell appears over Tokyo, aiming to conquer Earth. Despite the world's militaries being helpless against the invaders, the Magic User's Club, led by Takakura Takeo and Aburatsubo Ayanojyo, vow to defeat the alien menace.\n\nJoining the club are new recruits, the clumsy yet spirited Sae Sawanoguchi, the sensible tomboy Nanaka Nakatomi, and the gifted Akane Aikawa. Together, they must balance their daily lives, including homework and romantic entanglements, with their mission to save the world. The alien forces, known as Eyeballs, appear peaceful, following traffic laws and observing human society, but the Magic User's Club remains unconvinced.\n\nAs the world becomes accustomed to the alien presence, the Magic User's Club trains tirelessly, aiming to earn respect from their rivals, the Mizuha Miyama manga club, and ultimately, to uncover the true power of magic sealed within their souls. Can this eclectic group of high school students defeat the most powerful force in the universe and restore peace to Earth? Only time will tell.",
