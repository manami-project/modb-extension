    "text": "In a distant future, humans live underground in caves and villages to avoid dangers on the surface world above. Simon, a young digger, discovers a drill-shaped key that activates an ancient war robot called Lagann. His friend Kamina dreams of reaching the surface. When a surprise attack brings the surface dweller Yoko and her massive gun down to Simon's village, Simon, Kamina, and Yoko use Lagann to drive back the attack. Inspired by the battle, Simon, Kamina, and Yoko journey to the surface world together. There, they join the fight against the Beastmen - humanoid enemies piloting powerful robots called Gunmen who terrorize humanity. Though facing challenges, Simon and his growing team bravely take on these threats with their robot Lagann to reclaim the surface world for mankind. Along the way, they unravel a galactic mystery.",
