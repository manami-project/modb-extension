    "text": "Hal, a young man full of dreams, is tragically lost in an airplane accident, leaving his girlfriend Kurumi devastated and withdrawn from the world. To help her heal from her grief, a brilliant scientist creates an android replica of Hal, using advanced technology and the binary equivalent of human emotions. The android Hal is sent to Kurumi's secluded home, where he slowly begins to break through her walls of despair. Despite her initial reluctance, Kurumi starts to open up to the android Hal, forming a unique bond with him. But as their relationship deepens, they uncover unexpected truths about love, loss, and what it truly means to be alive. Will Kurumi find solace in this artificial replica of her lost love, or will the truth about Hal's existence shatter her fragile heart once more?",
