  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Haruyuki Arita and his friends, members of the Nega Nebulus legion, one of the elite groups battling for territory in the virtual reality world of Accel World. In the first OVA, \"Reverberation\", a mysterious hacker traps students on the school network, stripping their avatars of clothes and items. Kuroyukihime, the leader of Nega Nebulus, gathers the group to set a trap and uncover the hacker's identity, leading them to encounter the strange virtual world of Accel Link. In the second OVA, \"Vacation\", Haruyuki faces a challenge in the real world - he has two weeks to get in shape and pass a physical re-examination, or he'll be barred from competing in more territory battles. His friend Chiyuri Kurashima tries to help with a brutal fitness regime. When that fails, the friends visit a mixed-gender hot spring, hoping the experience will provide a last chance for Haruyuki to improve his physical health. With hacking mysteries in both the real and virtual worlds, the OVAs follow Nega Nebulus as they battle to protect their school network and legion - while helping their friend Haruyuki overcome his own real-world challenges.",
