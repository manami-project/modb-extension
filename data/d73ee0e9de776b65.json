    "text": "Accel World's limited edition simulation and action games come with a special treat: exclusive OVA episodes. The first episode, \"Reverberation,\" is bundled with Stage:01 Ginyoku no Kakusei, while the second, \"Vacation,\" comes with Stage:02 Kasoku no Chouten.\n\nIn \"Reverberation,\" Umesato Junior High is under digital siege. A skilled hacker is wreaking havoc on the school network, trapping students and stealing their avatars' virtual belongings. The Black Legion, led by Kuroyukihime and including members Chiyuri, Haruyuki, and Takumu, sets out to catch the culprit and put an end to the chaos.\n\nMeanwhile, in \"Vacation,\" Haruyuki's unhealthy eating habits threaten his participation in the territory battles. To avoid the school's mandatory health improvement program, he must shape up fast. Chiyuri steps in to help, but when Haruyuki's fitness regime fails, they turn to a mixed-gender hot springs visit as a last resort.\n\nAs the Black Legion grapples with digital threats and personal challenges, they must work together to protect their school and maintain their positions in the Accel World. Will they succeed in their missions and strengthen their bonds along the way? Only time will tell.",
