  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shiratori Ryuushi is an aspiring young artist who moves into an eccentric apartment complex called Narutakisou, hoping to attend art school in Tokyo and fulfill his dream of becoming a children's book author. However, Ryuushi soon discovers that both the apartment manager, his second cousin Kozue Aoba, and the other residents are rather strange. Kozue seems like a kind and charming high school girl at first, but Ryuushi is shocked to learn that she has multiple personality disorder. Her various identities - including the aggressive Saki, childish Nanako, and cosplay-obsessed Chiyuri - take over whenever Kozue gets startled. Living alongside Kozue is an equally eccentric cast of characters: her best friend Tamami, the free-spirited Megumi, single mother Sayoko and her studious daughter Asami, ventriloquist Haibara and his rude puppet Johnny. Despite the chaos of apartment life, Ryuushi begins to bond with Kozue and her many personalities over the changing seasons. He remains determined to follow his artistic dreams while enjoying the humor and warmth of his new friends at Narutakisou. Though they all have their quirks, together they create a heartfelt makeshift family.",
