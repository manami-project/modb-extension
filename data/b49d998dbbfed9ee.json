  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the midst of a seemingly ordinary school trip, Yogiri Takatou finds himself in an extraordinary situation. Unbeknownst to him, while he was napping, his class was transported to a fantastical realm by a sage named Sion. In this new world, Sion bestows upon the students unique supernatural abilities, with the intention of selecting the most capable among them to become the new sages. However, Yogiri, having slept through the event, appears to have been left powerless.\n\nWhen he awakens, he is greeted by chaos; a dragon is attacking, and his teachers are nowhere to be found. With a classmate, Tomochika Dannoura, left as bait for the dragon, Yogiri steps up to defend her despite his apparent lack of abilities. To his surprise, he discovers he possesses a formidable power: the ability to bring about death with a single thought.\n\nNow, armed with this deadly ability, Yogiri and Tomochika embark on a perilous journey to find a way back home. As they navigate through this unfamiliar world filled with danger and betrayal, Yogiri must confront those who underestimate him, including his former classmates. The journey promises to be anything but ordinary, as long as Yogiri can manage to stay awake.",
