  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lu Bixing, a young idealist, and Lin Jingheng, a disgraced former general, find themselves united in a shared mission to challenge a dystopian society that has cast them aside as \"defective.\" In this future world, an advanced AI called Eden connects the minds of most people, but one percent of the population remains incompatible with the technology. Branded as outcasts, these individuals are forced to live on the fringes of society. When Lin Jingheng is accused of a crime he did not commit, he joins forces with Lu Bixing and other outcasts to expose a sinister conspiracy that threatens to plunge the world into chaos. As they embark on an interstellar journey, they will stop at nothing to bring justice to a world that has rejected them. With a burning desire for vengeance and a newfound sense of purpose, they will rise from the depths of despair to challenge the very foundations of this unjust society.",
