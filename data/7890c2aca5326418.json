    "text": "Meiji era Kyoto is under threat from mysterious paranormal phenomena, but fear not, as a new generation of Shinsengumi has arrived to protect the city. Kondou Yuuko, Hijikata Toshie, and Okita Kaoru, daughters of former Shinsengumi members, are the armor-clad, sword-wielding samurai tasked with defending Japan from these supernatural dangers.\n\nThese three girls, known as the Mobile Shinsengumi, are not your typical samurai. They have a bad attitude and a tendency to cause trouble, but when it comes to battling evil spirits, they mean business. With the ability to request instant armor to fuse with and increase their powers, they are a force to be reckoned with.\n\nFollow the adventures of Yuuko, Toshie, and Kaoru as they take on the paranormal and defend Kyoto from any other dangers that may arise. They may not be the most traditional Shinsengumi, but they are determined to protect the city and keep their expenses to a minimum. Get ready for a wild ride with these sword-slinging samurai in Kid≈ç Shinsengumi Moeyo Ken.",
