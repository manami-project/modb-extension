    "text": "What begins as a typical day for Angelique Limoges, an ordinary schoolgirl, takes a dramatic turn when she's whisked away to the Sanctuary of the Cosmos's Queen. As the chosen contender in a grand competition to determine the next Queen, Angelique must harness the powers of nine dashing Guardians to transform a barren continent into a thriving civilization. However, her clumsy nature and lack of experience put her at a disadvantage against her polished rival, Rosalia de Cartagena, who's been groomed for this very contest since birth.\n\nBut as the competition unfolds, a darker plot emerges. Arios, one of the Guardians who recently met his demise, returns with a nefarious scheme to assassinate both queens. What was initially a friendly gathering of comrades quickly spirals into a desperate struggle for survival. Can Angelique and her allies unite to save not only themselves but also Arios from the clutches of his own malevolent intentions? This captivating tale unfolds over four OVAs, each filled with suspense, romance, and adventure.",
