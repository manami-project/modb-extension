    "text": "Takeru's partner, Patamon, exhibits distressing symptoms akin to those of infected Digimon, following the sudden transformation and subsequent defeat of Leomon by the recently joined Meicoomon. In an effort to contain the spread of this mysterious infection, Koushirou confines Agumon and the other Digimon within his office. Meanwhile, the Chosen Children grapple with the shocking betrayal of Meicoomon and her human partner, Meiko. As they search for answers, a cryptic message from Homeostasis reveals the imminent danger of total annihilation threatening both their world and the Digital World. In a desperate attempt to salvage the situation, Homeostasis plans to execute a 'Reboot' to eradicate the infection, which would inevitably wipe the memories of all Digimon, including the Chosen Children's partners. With the stakes higher than ever, the Chosen Children must race against time to find a solution and prevent the loss of their cherished bonds with their Digimon. This thrilling third installment in the new Digimon Adventure series promises an emotional rollercoaster filled with courage, friendship, and determination.",
