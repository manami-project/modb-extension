  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tonari no 801-chan is a short anime adaptation of a manga that provides a glimpse into the lives of an otaku couple. It centers around a 28-year-old salaryman who is obsessed with anime and his 22-year-old girlfriend who works with him and is a fujoshi - a female otaku focused on yaoi content. The 2-minute animation came bundled as a DVD extra with volume 4 of the original manga series, allowing fans of the manga a chance to see the characters brought to life. While brief, this anime vignette offers viewers a humorous and affectionate depiction of an unconventional relationship between two people embracing their otaku interests together.",
