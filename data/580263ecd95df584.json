  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With a family tree brimming with celebrities, Izumi Sena is the odd one out. He's a quiet college student with a secret passion for manga illustration. His life takes a dramatic turn when he's coerced into acting in a TV commercial, where he's required to dress as a woman. The twist? He's paired with the charismatic and popular actor, Ryouma Ichijou, who falls head over heels for Izumi, believing him to be a girl. Unbeknownst to Ryouma, this isn't their first encounter; they had met on the set of the same commercial a decade ago. As the truth about Izumi's gender unravels, will Ryouma's feelings remain unchanged? And how will Izumi navigate this unexpected turn of events in his otherwise ordinary life? This anime delves into the complexities of love, identity, and the pursuit of dreams.",
