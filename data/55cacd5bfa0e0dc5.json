    "text": "Tomoya and his team at Blessing Software embark on a research mission at a lavish hotel, aiming to gather inspiration for their upcoming game's swimsuit event. As the illustrator, Eriri Spencer Sawamura, requests Megumi Katou to model in a swimsuit for the game's heroine, Megumi insists that everyone else follows suit. With the team's usual dynamics in play - Utaha and Eriri bickering, Michiru doing her own thing, and Megumi maintaining her aloof demeanor - the group conducts their research while enjoying the poolside luxury. This special episode, available on Amazon Prime, offers fans the long-awaited swimsuit episode, blending fun and work in the picturesque setting of a hotel overlooking the Rainbow Bridge in Tokyo Bay.",
