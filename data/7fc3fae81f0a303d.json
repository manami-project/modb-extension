  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Haruka Sakura has always been an outcast due to his unusual looks and lack of social grace. Fighting is the only thing that makes him feel strong. He enrolls at the notorious Furin High School, hoping to prove himself as the strongest fighter around. However, Sakura is surprised to discover that Furin High School students have banded together as \"Bofurin\" to protect their town of Makochi. Though initially disappointed that there are few fights at school, Sakura can't help but be intrigued by Bofurin's mission. After jumping into a street fight alongside his future classmates, Sakura gets a taste of what it's like to fight for something bigger than himself. As formidable threats arise, he finds himself reluctantly standing alongside Bofurin. Through this unusual brotherhood, Sakura experiences acceptance and belonging for the first time. Though more accustomed to proving his lone strength, Sakura must push past his discomfort if he is to protect the town he is coming to care about. In defending Makochi with Bofurin, Sakura discovers the power of fighting for people instead of only for himself.",
