  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Furin High School, a haven for delinquents, is known for its students' brawling prowess rather than academic excellence. Enter Haruka Sakura, a first-year student with an unusual goal: to become the strongest fighter in town. Hailing from a troubled past, Sakura's only interest lies in combat, with no time for the weak or mundane activities like schoolwork.\n\nIn a town plagued by territorial disputes, Sakura envisions himself as the hero it needs. However, Furin High School is not the battleground he expected. Instead of fighting each other, the students unite to protect their beloved town as the \"Chime of the Wind Breaker\" â€“ Bofurin.\n\nDespite his initial disappointment, Sakura finds himself drawn into Bofurin's mission. Struggling to reconcile his desire for power and recognition with the camaraderie and purpose he finds in Bofurin, Sakura must decide what kind of hero he truly wants to be. Will he continue his quest for dominance, or will he learn to harness his strength for the greater good?\n\nJoin Sakura in this action-packed tale of a high school delinquent's journey towards self-discovery and redemption, as he navigates the complexities of friendship, loyalty, and what it truly means to be strong.",
