    "text": "Hope seems to be fading for the idol group TiNgS, as their dreams of stardom remain unfulfilled and the threat of disbandment looms. Led by Haru Nabatame, the group's small achievements are dwarfed by their big aspirations. Just when they need a miracle, enter Naose Hinaki, an unmotivated man with a hidden talent. Despite his initial reluctance, Hinaki takes on the challenge of managing TiNgS, sensing Haru's genuine passion for idols with his unique ability to detect sincerity. As they strive to fill two thousand seats in their upcoming concert to save their careers, TiNgS faces stiff competition from the more popular group HY:RAIN, led by Haru's classmate Ren Kurogane. Will Hinaki's special skillset and Haru's unwavering determination be enough to propel TiNgS to become 'absolute idols' and shine brightly in the world of idol entertainment? The journey to stardom begins here!",
