This introverted young artist joins her school's art club, where she encounters an eclectic mix of personalities that challenge her timid nature. As she navigates through her newfound friendships and artistic endeavors, Sora discovers that her once narrow perspective begins to expand, allowing her to see the beauty in the world around her. With her new friends by her side, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and artistic growth, sketching her way through the highs and lows of adolescence and learning to appreciate the subtle nuances that make life truly remarkable.",
