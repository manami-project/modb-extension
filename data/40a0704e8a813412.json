    "text": "In the magical kingdom of Juraihelm, Tsunami is next in line to be crowned queen. However, before she can take the throne, she must complete a test to prove she can make the world a better place. Tsunami chooses ordinary schoolgirl Sasami Kawai for this task, granting her magical powers to transform into Pretty Sammy, a champion of justice. She also provides Sasami a magical baton and appoints Ryo-Okhi, a rabbit-like creature, as her guide. However, Tsunami's rival Ramia has her own plans for the crown. She creates the eccentric magical girl Pixy Misa to wreak havoc with her Love-Love monsters and disrupt Tsunami's coronation. Now Sasami must balance her normal life of school and working in her parents' music shop with her new secret identity as Pretty Sammy. Despite finding her magical girl duties embarrassing, she must overcome her reluctance and work with Ryo-Okhi to stop Pixy Misa's chaos. The fate of Juraihelm hangs in the balance!",
