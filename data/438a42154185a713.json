In this peculiar place, she encounters an array of renowned scientists such as Galileo Galilei, Marie Curie, and Sir Isaac Newton. However, these historical figures are far from what she expects, each possessing unique quirks and professions.\n\nThe anime follows Marie's adventures as she navigates this strange new world with her sentient stuffed animal, Pet. Alongside Galileo, who has a knack for making science engaging and entertaining, Marie learns about various scientific concepts through a blend of humor, music, and dance.\n\nOriginally aired as part of NHK's educational programming, this anime offers a fresh and captivating approach to learning science. Despite her initial drowsiness at the mere mention of science, Marie finds herself captivated by the wonders of Galihabara and its eccentric inhabitants, providing viewers with an entertaining and educational journey.",
