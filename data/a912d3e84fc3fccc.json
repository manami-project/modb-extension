    "text": "Ayumi Himekawa and Maya Kitajima, two rival actresses from the Glass no Kamen franchise, team up in a special collaboration episode with Himitsukessha Taka no Tsume to promote the launch of their respective anime series. In this thrilling crossover, two Chancellors emerge, prompting the arrival of Deluxe Fighter, whose mission is to eliminate the double threat of evil. However, the situation takes a surprising turn when one Chancellor is revealed to be Ayumi in disguise, and Deluxe Fighter is unmasked as Maya. As the two actresses engage in their usual one-upmanship, the real Chancellor and Yoshida are left bewildered by the unexpected turn of events. Adding to the confusion, a self-deprecating joke breaks the fourth wall, as the characters express their surprise that DLE will be animating the new Glass no Kamen anime. This collaboration episode promises a unique blend of action, humor, and drama, as well as a sneak peek into the highly anticipated Glass no Kamen anime.",
