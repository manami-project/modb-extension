  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two variations of a thought-provoking experimental animation short, created by the visionary Kuri Yoji in 1966, invite viewers to reflect on the consequences of human actions. In a world grappling with a burgeoning population, the film confronts the grim reality of escalating infanticide, hinting at the potential normalization of murder.\n\nThe original black-and-white version, spanning 13 minutes, and the edited international color version, running for 9 minutes, both explore a series of vignettes that highlight the cause-and-effect nature of human decisions. From a desperate man's cry for help inadvertently leading to his own downfall, to a seemingly innocent pause for a photograph resulting in unforeseen consequences, the film underscores the importance of considering the outcomes of our choices.",
