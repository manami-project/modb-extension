  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This experimental animation short from pioneering filmmaker Kuri Yoji tackles heavy societal issues. Set in a time of overpopulation growth, it depicts increasing instances of infant murder and questions whether such acts could become officially sanctioned. This monochrome film weighing in at 13 minutes represents the director's original version, though a shortened 9-minute international edit exists in color. Through a series of vignettes, viewers witness how split-second decisions trigger shocking and often disturbing consequences. Whether stopping to capture a photo or responding to a call for help, the film suggests one must carefully consider potential outcomes before acting. Though unsettling, Kuri's film prompts reflection on morality and choice in an overcrowded world.",
