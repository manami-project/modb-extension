    "text": "He's an aspiring author, and she's his unsuspecting muse. Meet Yuu Nagami, a high school student determined to make his mark in the world of light novels, and his younger sister, Suzuka, a stunningly beautiful and academically gifted middle school student who also happens to be the student council president. When Yuu discovers that Suzuka is the talented author behind the pen name Chikai Towano, winner of a prestigious light novel award, he's shocked. But when Suzuka asks him to pose as Chikai Towano in her place, Yuu sees an opportunity to not only improve his own writing skills but also to help his sister pursue her passion. As Yuu navigates the world of light novels and quirky associates, he finds himself clashing with them while also learning valuable lessons about writing and relationships. All the while, Suzuka, who has never shown any affection towards her older brother, begins to see him in a new light. Will Yuu be able to publish his own book and reveal his sister's true identity, or will he continue to be her proxy in the literary world? Join Yuu and Suzuka in this heartwarming and hilarious journey of sibling rivalry, love, and the pursuit of dreams.",
