    "text": "Pipi, a mermaid, and Triton, a young boy with vibrant green hair, are the sole survivors of a catastrophic event that occurred 5,000 years ago when the Poseidon Family wiped out the peaceful Triton Family and the continent of Atlantis. Triton, a member of the Triton Family, was carried to the shores of a fishing village by the white dolphin Ruka and raised by a benevolent man for 13 years. As Triton learns about his heritage and the tragic fate of his parents at the hands of the Poseidon Family, he is compelled to embark on a perilous journey across the ocean. His mission is to confront the Poseidon Family and restore harmony to the seas. Joined by Ruka, Pipi, and a host of aquatic allies, Triton sets out to fulfill his destiny and bring an end to the Poseidon Family's reign of terror.",
