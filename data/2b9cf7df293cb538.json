  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ani, cherished by his twelve sisters, embarks on a new chapter as he leaves the family nest to live independently. Similarly, his sisters have also chosen their own paths, leading to separate living arrangements. Despite the physical distance, the bond between Ani and his sisters remains unbroken, as they continue to reunite and cherish their time together.\n\nEach sister brings a unique flavor to Ani's life, from Hina's amusing encounters with frogs on her quest to deliver an umbrella, to Chikage's introspective nature and her attempts to entice him with a golden apple, to Aria's fantastical world that seems to blur the lines between reality and imagination.\n\nThrough the lens of these twelve sisters, we witness a myriad of experiences unfold, from fanciful dreams of matrimony to navigating a peculiar fantasy realm. Join them as they journey through life's ups and downs, sharing moments of joy and sorrow, all the while maintaining their unbreakable bond as siblings.",
