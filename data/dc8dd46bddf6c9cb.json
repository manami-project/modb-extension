Futaba Odagiri, the vivacious new transfer student, and Teru Hayama, the deceptively innocent class president with a sharp tongue, cross paths with Nishikawa in an unexpected encounter. Despite their contrasting personalities and backgrounds, these three girls, each with the kanji for 'leaf' in their names, form an unlikely bond. Together, they navigate the tumultuous waters of high school life, their friendship blossoming amidst the challenges and humor that their teenage years have to offer. This heartwarming and amusing tale, Sansha Sanyou, invites you to join these three unique friends as they journey through adolescence, learning to balance their individual quirks and embrace their shared experiences.",
