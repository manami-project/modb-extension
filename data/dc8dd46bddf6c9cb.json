  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Futaba Odagiri is the energetic new transfer student at an all-girls high school. Despite her cheerful personality, she is quite a glutton. Teru Hayama is the class president who appears innocent but actually has a surprisingly blunt, sometimes mean personality. Youko Nishikawa comes from a formerly wealthy family that went bankrupt. Though now poor, she still carries herself like a princess. These three very different teenagers happen to share the kanji for \"leaf\" in their names. After a chance encounter eating lunch together in the forest near school, they strike up an unlikely friendship. Balancing their clashing personalities while navigating high school life proves amusingly chaotic. Sansha Sanyou is a lighthearted comedy following the humorous adventures of three contrasting friends - the genki transfer student, the two-faced class president, and the fallen princess. Though different in many ways, their friendship blossoms as they learn from each other and take on the everyday challenges of school.",
