    "text": "Shirobom and Aobon are B-da cops who protect the peace in the B-da Union. When they witness a spaceship crash in the wilderness, pursued by space pirates, they discover Princess Akabon lying next to a powerful gem called the Crysmond. Akabon's kingdom has been attacked and the pirates seek to steal the Crysmond. Shirobom, Aobon, and their fellow B-da cops Kiirobon and Kurobon team up with Akabon on an adventure to guard the Crysmond from the villainous Devil Vaders. Long ago, the beautiful B-da City was assaulted by the sinister Dark B-da who aimed to control the entire Blue Solar System. The brave B-daman warriors were able to beat them back then. Now, a millennium later, the Dark B-da threat has returned in the form of the Devil Vaders. Our heroes must once again take a stand with their legendary power and advanced technology to maintain peace across the galaxies.",
