  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuji Yagami is a high school student who has developed romantic feelings for his mother Nomi, who looks and acts very youthful for her age. This \"mother complex\" of Yuuji's causes tension as several other characters also have affection for Nomi, including Yuuji's father, his teacher Akira, and his father's secretary. Meanwhile, Yuuji also has a shy girlfriend named Mayuki who is talented at motorcycling but gets jealous of the attention he gives to his mother. As the various romantic entanglements around Nomi heat up, Yuuji struggles to overcome his mother complex and lead a more normal life. Later on, a new student joins Yuuji's class who looks identical to Nomi, causing further chaos as the entire class falls for this boy who resembles Yuuji's mother. Through all of these comedic romantic mixups involving both Nomi and her doppelganger, Yuuji tries to sort out his feelings and relationships.",
