  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Valentine's Day brings a love letter for Yuuji Yagami, a high school student grappling with an unusual infatuation - his mother, Nomi, who possesses an eternally youthful appearance and demeanor. Oblivious to her son's feelings, Nomi unintentionally fuels his affection through her overly affectionate behavior towards both Yuuji and his father. As Yuuji navigates this complex emotional landscape, he finds himself caught in a web of romantic entanglements involving his teacher, Akira, who also harbors feelings for Nomi, and his shy, motorbike-riding girlfriend, Mayuki. Meanwhile, Yuuji's father must contend with the affections of his secretary, who, upon discovering his wife's youthful appearance, shifts her romantic interests to Yuuji. Amidst this chaos, a new student joins Yuuji's class, bearing a striking resemblance to Nomi and further complicating matters. Yagami-kun OAV is a low-budget manga spinoff that explores these intricate relationships, with its production video proving more captivating than the anime itself.",
