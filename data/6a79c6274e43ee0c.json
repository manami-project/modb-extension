    "text": "Yui is a young girl who has passed the entrance exam to attend Oumi Academy. She makes plans to move in with her childhood friend, Junpei, and his family who live near the school. However, when Yui's father sees her waking up naked one morning, he mistakenly assumes someone has taken advantage of his daughter. He then forbids Yui from staying with Junpei and decides she must attend a local high school instead. Determined to clear up this misunderstanding, Junpei goes to meet with Yui's parents. But he soon discovers that Yui has run away from home in the aftermath of her father's decision. Junpei sets out to find Yui and bring her back safely. The two end up accidentally boarding the wrong train late at night, stranding them alone together at a hot spring hotel. This side story provides backstory on events alluded to in the main Ichigo 100% anime series. It depicts the circumstances leading up to Yui moving out of her family home, a key moment in her growth into womanhood. The misunderstanding with her father also strains Yui's relationships and plans for her future.",
