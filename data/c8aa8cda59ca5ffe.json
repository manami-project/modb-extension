    "text": "Sakamoto was the most popular student at his high school in Japan, admired by classmates for his good looks, academic excellence, grace under pressure, and uncanny ability to handle any situation with style. After graduating, he moved to America to join NASA's space program. Back in Japan, Sakamoto's former classmates fondly recall his glory days ruling the school hallways. Excited to pay tribute to his enduring legend, they decide to produce a movie celebrating his past exploits. As they brainstorm ideas for the film, their imaginations run wild envisioning Sakamoto's new life in America: perhaps he is foiling bullies at NASA, captivating female astronauts, or piloting rockets to Mars? The possibilities are endless when it comes to the enigmatic Sakamoto. Though gone, Sakamoto continues to entrance all those who crossed his path with his charm and flair. His mystique and movie-worthy persona will live on in the hearts and minds of his adoring schoolmates. Wherever Sakamoto may be now, one thing is for certain - he is doing it with style.",
