  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A Knot in Time centers around high school student Mayumi, who makes a strange discovery while vacationing at the beach. She finds a camera floating in the ocean that contains a photo of herself with a mysterious man she doesn't recognize. Even more puzzling, the camera model won't be released for another two years. As Mayumi investigates the origins of the perplexing photo, she finds herself uncontrollably traveling through time. Accompanied by her friend Kiwako and Kiwako's brother, Mayumi tries to unravel the mystery and understand her connection to this future camera and the unknown man. In a separate, surreal tale titled File 538, a down-on-his-luck private eye takes on surveillance of an odd father-daughter pair. Planes that fly above them bizarrely transform into giant carp, defying reality. As the detective delves deeper into his surveillance, he too becomes drawn into the strange distortions surrounding this duo. Together, these two mind-bending stories form Twilight Q - an avant-garde anime anthology exploring supernatural themes of time travel, mystery, and the unexplained. Reality itself is questioned in these twisting tales from the frontier of imagination.",
