  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the summer sun beats down on the beach, high school friends Mayumi and Kiwako stumble upon an enigmatic discovery while diving in the ocean: a camera, tangled in coral, with an undeveloped film inside. The resulting photograph reveals a chilling image of Mayumi with an unfamiliar man, and the revelation that the camera model is not yet on the market propels them into a perplexing journey through time. Meanwhile, in an intertwining tale, a struggling private investigator is drawn into a bizarre case involving a father-daughter duo and the inexplicable disappearance of airplanes, which are rumored to transform into giant carp mid-flight. As the detective delves deeper, he finds himself entangled in a reality that defies all logic and reasoning. This anime weaves together two suspenseful narratives that will keep you on the edge of your seat, questioning the very nature of time and reality.",
