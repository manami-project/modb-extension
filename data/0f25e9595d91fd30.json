  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Under the vigilant eye of Zero, the world's first true superhero, a new era of heroes emerged, only to be followed by a relentless five-year war that ended with Zero's mysterious vanishing. Now, in a realm where the boundaries between justice and evil, magic and science blur, a seemingly ordinary teenager named Lin Jie finds himself thrust into the extraordinary world of heroism.\n\nLin Jie, an avid enthusiast of manga, anime, and video games, is forced out of his comfortable life by his exasperated sister, who insists he finds employment before returning. In an unexpected turn of events, Lin Jie is enlisted as a sidekick by a budding hero, marking his official entry into the world of heroes.\n\nHowever, beneath Lin Jie's unassuming and lethargic facade lies a hidden identity - the legendary Zero, who once safeguarded humanity from monstrous hordes and inspired countless others to embrace heroism before inexplicably disappearing. Now, under a new alias and alongside fresh allies, Lin Jie embarks on a journey to perform more heroic acts, or at the very least, earn a living.",
