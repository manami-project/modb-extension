  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a world where superheroes exist, Zero emerged as the first true hero to protect humanity. Over his 5 year tenure, he inspired countless others to follow in his footsteps before mysteriously vanishing. Years later, an unassuming teenager named Lin Jie leads an ordinary life until circumstances force his sister to kick him out. As luck would have it, he soon lands a job as a new hero's sidekick. Little does anyone realize, Lin Jie hides an incredible secret - he is actually the legendary Zero, returning in disguise after years in hiding. Though content to keep a low profile, Lin Jie finds himself drawn into action once more as a new threat looms. Together with fresh allies, this veteran hero straddles the line between super-powered battles and ordinary teenage life. Will the truth of his identity come to light? Can Zero rise to the occasion yet again to become humanity's savior?",
