  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hinata Hoshino goes on a camping trip to the countryside with her friends Hana Shirosaki and Noa Himesaka. Hinata convinces her older sister Miyako to join them, but Miyako seems unhappy about going. Seeing how gloomy Miyako is, Hinata, Hana, and Noa try their best to help Miyako enjoy the trip too. The camping trip is one of four short stories contained in this special OVA release bundled with the third BD/DVD volume of the anime series \"Watashi ni Tenshi ga Maiorita!\". The other stories provide further glimpses into the daily lives of Hinata, Miyako, and their friends. One story shows the group struggling to make their camping trip work out as planned, but still finding enjoyment in their time together at the seaside. Another story depicts how Miyako's friend Kouko first met and got to know Miyako. There is also a Halloween story where Miyako helps make one of Kouko's dreams come true. Finally, there is a heartwarming story about Miyako eagerly awaiting the birth of her little sister Hinata. While the lives of these girls may seem ordinary, one thing is made abundantly clear across each of these stories - there is no shortage of cuteness and wholesome moments in their relationships with one another.",
