  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The evil Garlic Jr., son of a demon who once tried to seize Kami's throne, seeks revenge and immortal tyranny over Earth. After his henchmen kidnap Goku's young son Gohan, Garlic Jr. uses the Dragon Balls to attain eternal life, planning to rule the world with his demon army. Goku teams up with his former nemesis Piccolo to rescue Gohan and defeat Garlic Jr., but how can they triumph over an immortal foe? This story transpires between Goku's victory over Piccolo at the martial arts tournament and the arrival of his long-lost brother Raditz, as Goku adjusts to a peaceful family life with his wife Chi-Chi while still facing new threats. Garlic Jr. proves a dangerous enemy, with designs not just on revenge but total world domination. Yet even immortal, he may be no match for the combined might of Goku and Piccolo, who put aside their rivalry for Gohan's sake. Their struggle pits raw strength against endless lifespan - with the fate of the world in the balance.",
