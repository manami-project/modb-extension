  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Maiko Tamaki, Chimu, Harusa, and an unnamed protagonist share a seemingly ordinary high school life filled with naps, strawberry milk, and karaoke sessions. However, the protagonist's world begins to unravel as he experiences vivid nightmares about destruction and death, and his memories start to diverge from those of his friends.\n\nAs he struggles to maintain his grip on reality, the protagonist encounters a mysterious girl named Aya, who seems to exist only in his dreams and waking visions. This enigmatic figure leads him to question the very nature of his existence and the world around him.\n\nIn this dreamlike state, the protagonist and his friends confront shadowy creatures and stumbling zombies, only to awaken and find themselves back in their everyday lives. As the boundaries between reality and dreams become increasingly blurred, the protagonist must navigate this strange world and uncover the truth about his own existence.\n\nWith the ominous rumor of people's shadows disappearing spreading throughout Japan, the protagonist is left to wonder if he holds the key to saving or destroying the world as he knows it. Can he find a way to reconcile his nightmares with reality, or will he be forever trapped in this terrifying, surreal realm?",
