    "text": "In the winter of 2028, tensions rise amid signs of postwar reconstruction in New Port City. Foreign business interests spark demonstrations that escalate into a shooting incident with police. This turmoil stems from a cyberbrain virus released by the hacker terrorist \"Fire Starter.\" An independent military unit led by Major Motoko Kusanagi responds to the crisis. Seeking their own form of justice, her squad aims to suppress the situation by any means necessary. Below the surface lies Emma, a mysterious \"tin girl,\" and Burinda Junior, an equally cryptic \"scarecrow man.\" As Kusanagi contends with Fire Starter's chaos, she comes closer to uncovering what these two enigmatic figures seek. When riot police open fire on citizens, the Major and her ghost operatives are forced into action. Tracking the shadowy Fire Starter through New Port City's underworld, they wage a high-stakes battle to save lives and reveal difficult truths. Kusanagi soon realizes no one involved is exactly who they appear to be.",
