As their father works tirelessly to support the family, Takuya becomes the primary caregiver for his baby brother. His days are filled with tasks like cooking, cleaning, and picking Minoru up from nursery school, all while navigating the complexities of his own childhood.\n\nTakuya's life is a stark contrast to his friends, who enjoy the freedom of their youth. Despite the challenges, Takuya finds solace in his heart-warming memories of his mother, which guide him in caring for Minoru. The journey is fraught with difficulties, but Takuya is determined to embody the true spirit of family, balancing his love and resentment for his brother, just as his mother would have wanted.
