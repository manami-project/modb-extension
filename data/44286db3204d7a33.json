    "text": "Mio Sudou is a 30-year-old office worker who has not had a romantic relationship in five years. Shuuji Mashima works as an overseas consultant and has lost interest in romance after going without a girlfriend for seven years. The two meet at a matchmaking party where Shuuji initially states he is \"not into women,\" offending Mio. However, an unexpected spark between them leads to a night of passion, reigniting desires they thought were long forgotten. As they continue their sexual relationship, Mio and Shuuji discover an intoxicating physical connection unlike any they've experienced before. Though unsure what to make of their compatibility, they find themselves longing for more. What began as a provocative proposition may turn into something meaningful after all - if these two disillusioned hearts can learn to be vulnerable again.",
