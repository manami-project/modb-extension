  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Atsushi Arisawa had a childhood crush on his friend Masami Shibata. Years later, Atsushi enrolls at Jougaoka High School after learning Masami works there as a teacher. However, on his first day, Atsushi is shocked to discover the school nurse Masayoshi Shibata - who he mistakes for Masami. Masayoshi's bold personality is nothing like the gentle Masami that Atsushi remembers. It turns out Masayoshi is actually Masami's twin brother. Meanwhile, Atsushi's friend Kouji Inagaki relentlessly pursues a romantic relationship with him at the school. Initially overwhelmed, Atsushi eventually warms up to the idea that this new Ma-chan (Masayoshi) isn't so bad after all. But just when he starts to settle into school life with his friends new and old, Atsushi uncovers the truth - that the man he has grown fond of is not his childhood crush Masami, but rather his twin brother Masayoshi.",
