  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mankind's pursuit of longevity through gene manipulation in a distant, dystopian future has left them unable to reproduce, pushing humanity towards the brink of extinction. To sustain the dwindling workforce, clones were created, but they rebelled 1,200 years ago and retreated to the depths of a subterranean world. As the surface becomes increasingly inhospitable due to environmental destruction, chemical contamination, and radioactive fallout, the ozone layer's depletion allows harmful UV rays to further deteriorate the human genome.\n\nIn an unexpected twist, the clones inhabiting the underworld may have regained fertility, sparking a desperate mission to explore the treacherous, monster-infested labyrinth beneath the surface. Parton, a brave and determined individual, is chosen to delve into the dark underbelly of their world and uncover the secrets of the rebellious clones, potentially securing the future of humanity. As Parton embarks on this perilous journey, the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, hinging on the success of this ecological study and the reproductive capabilities of their estranged creations.",
