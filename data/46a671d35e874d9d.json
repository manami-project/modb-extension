  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's mid-December and Kyon is looking forward to spending time with his eccentric friend Haruhi Suzumiya and the rest of their club, the SOS Brigade. They had been planning a fun Christmas party together. But when Kyon arrives at school, everything has inexplicably changed - Haruhi and the rest of the brigade seem to have vanished. None of his classmates remember Haruhi or even the SOS Brigade ever existing. The clubroom now belongs solely to Yuki Nagato's Literature Club. With his friends gone without a trace, Kyon is disturbed and determined to uncover what happened. He seems to be the only one with memories of Haruhi and the life they shared. Through investigating this bizarre twist of events on his own, Kyon stumbles on a supernatural explanation. To restore his chaotic yet familiar world, he realizes he must unravel the mystery behind Haruhi's disappearance across space and time. Kyon now faces a choice - remain in this mundane new reality without aliens, espers and time travelers, or fight to reconnect with his missing comrades and bring back the SOS Brigade.",
