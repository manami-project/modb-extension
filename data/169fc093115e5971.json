  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2015, the organization NERV faces an existential threat when the shadowy cabal SEELE launches an attack on their headquarters in Tokyo-3. SEELE aims to hijack NERV's Evangelion program in order to initiate the Human Instrumentality Project - their plan to eradicate individuality and fuse all human souls into one entity. With NERV's final line of defense - the Evangelion pilots Shinji, Asuka and Rei - indisposed, the burden of resisting SEELE falls to NERV's staff, led by Commander Gendo Ikari and Captain Misato Katsuragi. As SEELE's military forces invade HQ, these unlikely heroes make a valiant last stand to protect Tokyo-3 and determine humanity's future. The climactic battle ahead will test the mettle of NERV's survivors and reveal secrets that explain the true origin and purpose of the Evangelion units. The stakes have never been higher. Will Shinji emerge from his stupor to aid in NERV's hour of need? Can Asuka's rage overcome her injuries? Does Gendo have an agenda beyond defending Tokyo-3? The answers await in this thrilling, philosophical and apocalyptic conclusion to Neon Genesis Evangelion.",
