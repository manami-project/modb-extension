    "text": "The Nohara family's ordinary life takes a dramatic turn when Shinnosuke discovers a mysterious black marble, which his younger sister, Himawari, accidentally ingests. Unbeknownst to them, the marble holds the key to resurrecting Jarke, an evil genie bent on global domination. As a result, the Noharas find themselves entangled in a dangerous conflict between the Tamayura and Tamayomi clans, both vying for control of the marble.\n\nIn an attempt to thwart the Tamayomi clan's sinister plot, the Tamayura clan, represented by three flamboyant brothers, Rose, Lavender, and Lemon, successfully retrieve Jarke's ball from the Tamayomi's bar girl gang. However, their victory is short-lived as Himawari unwittingly consumes the crucial artifact.\n\nJoined by the three brothers and a determined female detective, Yone Higashimatsuyama, the Nohara family embarks on a thrilling and action-packed adventure. As they navigate the bustling streets of Tokyo and the serene landscapes of Aomori, they must outrun and outsmart the relentless Tamayomi gang in a fierce battle to protect Himawari and prevent the resurrection of the evil genie.",
