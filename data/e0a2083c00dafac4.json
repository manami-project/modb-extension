  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wily, a nefarious villain, escapes from the video game world of Rockman, posing a threat to the real world. Rockman, the game's hero, follows Wily into the real world to thwart his evil plans and restore order. Along the way, Rockman teams up with a human friend named Yuuta and embarks on a journey across Japan to track down Wily. As they search for Wily, Rockman learns about Japanese culture and adapts to the real world.\n\nThis anime, which features Rockman traveling from the game world to the real world, was originally intended to be a special episode for the Mega Man cartoon series by Ruby-Spears. However, the episode was completed before Ruby-Spears decided to redesign the show for American audiences, and it was ultimately not included in the series. Despite this, two more episodes with the same story were produced later, this time under the title \"Rockman.\" These three episodes were eventually released on DVD by Capcom of Japan in 2002, in celebration of Rockman's 15th anniversary. The DVD features both Japanese and English dubs, but no subtitles. It is unclear if there are any other undiscovered animated works based on the original Rockman game series.",
