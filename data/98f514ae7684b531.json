  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rick Gladiator decides to pursue his dream of becoming an adventurer at the ripe age of thirty-three, stepping away from his mundane job at the Adventurers' Guild. While unconventional, Rick's age and experience prove to be assets. Having built connections with elite adventurers like the Orichalcum Fist party over his guild career, he gained combat skills and magic abilities far beyond the average starting adventurer. With training from the best and over thirty years of worldly knowledge under his belt, Rick sets out to take on monsters and mystical beasts alike. He quickly gains a reputation, rising up the adventurer ranks despite raised eyebrows over his senior status. Though tested by those who underestimate him, Rick proves unphased. Backed by the deadly fighting prowess honed alongside his legendary mentors, he can bend steel armor with ease and take down creatures as formidable as vampires and dragons. Far exceeding expectations for someone starting so late, Rick Gladiator shows it's never too late to step into your calling. His thrill-packed story challenges preconceived notions about age and ability limits for aspiring heroes.",
