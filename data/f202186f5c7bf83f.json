  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Inari is a kindhearted but clumsy middle school girl living in Kyoto. She has a huge crush on her classmate Kouji Tanbabashi, but her crippling shyness prevents her from confessing her feelings to him. One day while taking a shortcut to school, Inari rescues a fox pup from drowning in the river. This act of kindness catches the attention of Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami, the goddess of the nearby Inari Shrine. As thanks, the goddess grants Inari the ability to transform into anyone she wants. With her newfound shapeshifting powers, Inari hopes she can finally work up the courage to tell Kouji how she feels about him. However, her magical gift soon draws her into the affairs of the spirit world. Inari befriends the goddess and her fox envoys, but also encounters supernatural beings who have taken an sinister interest in her powers. As Inari navigates her adventures with spirits, gods, and monsters, she learns that true courage comes from within. And perhaps with some magic on her side, she can reveal her heart to Kouji after all.",
