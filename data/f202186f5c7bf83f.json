  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Grateful, compassionate, and a tad clumsy, Inari Fushimi navigates the trials and tribulations of middle school with a secret crush on the ever-cheerful Kouji Tanbabashi. Her timid nature and below-average intellect make it challenging to express her feelings, leading to a series of awkward encounters. One fateful day, Inari's life takes a supernatural turn when she rescues a fox pup from a river near the local Inari Shrine.\n\nIn gratitude for her selfless act, Uka-no-Mitama-no-Kami, the shrine's deity, bestows upon Inari a fragment of her divine power. This newfound ability allows Inari to transform into anyone she desires, giving her the chance to win over her crush and gain new experiences. As she dives deeper into the world of gods and mystical beings, Inari forms a heartfelt bond with Uka-sama and the fox spirit Kon.\n\nWith her shape-shifting powers and a touch of divine intervention, Inari embarks on a journey filled with love, friendship, and self-discovery. Will she finally find the courage to reveal her true feelings to Kouji, or will the complexities of her newfound abilities lead to unexpected challenges? Join Inari on this enchanting adventure as she learns that love transcends boundaries and appearances.",
