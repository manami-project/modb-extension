  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tooru Okada's captivating pop songs, performed in English by SEIKA, set the stage for the silent narrative of A-Girl, an anime that revolves around the lives of two sisters, Mariko and Mayu. When a fire forces the high-schooler Mariko and her elder sister to vacate their apartment, they find refuge with their landlord, where Mariko encounters the charming and attractive Natsume, the landlord's son and a successful model.\n\nAs love blossoms between Mariko and Natsume, the couple faces turbulence when Mariko uncovers Natsume's infidelity, leading to a heart-wrenching breakup. However, fate has other plans, as the pair ultimately reconciles, allowing love to prevail.\n\nIn this unique OVA, the minimal use of dialogue is supplemented by intertitles, reminiscent of classic silent films. The story unfolds further as Mariko, Mayu, and Mariko's ill-tempered boyfriend become entangled with Ichiro, an arrogant and womanizing male model, adding intrigue and drama to this engaging tale.",
