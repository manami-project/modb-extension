  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese soccer is struggling to compete on the international stage, and the Raimon Eleven soccer team has been disbanded in an effort to strengthen the sport at a national level. The players are sent to different teams across Japan, and sponsorship has become crucial for a team's survival. Inakuni Raimon, a team made up of players from the remote Inakunijima Island, has replaced the original Raimon Eleven as Raimon Junior High's soccer team. Led by forward Asuto Inamori, they are competing as underdogs in the annual Football Frontier youth tournament. However, when their only soccer field is destroyed, the team is left without a sponsor and facing disbandment. In a desperate bid to save their club, Asuto and his friends move to Tokyo to attend Raimon Junior High and participate in the Football Frontier. With the odds stacked against them, they must fight to win at least one game and secure a sponsor. Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin follows the journey of this group of friends as they strive to become the best in Japan and face off against the strongest teams in the tournament.",
