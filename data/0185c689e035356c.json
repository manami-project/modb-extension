    "text": "Lotte's'Pink Valentine' campaign takes center stage in this vibrant music video, a collaborative effort between Enishiya and musical sensation Eve. The video, which doubles as a commercial for Lotte's Ghana brand chocolates, is set to the tune of Eve's infectious single, 'Kokoro Yohou' or 'Heart Forecast'. As Valentine's Day approaches, we follow the exciting journey of three friends - Akane, Momo, and Yukie, Lotte Ghana chocolate's original characters. Each friend is on a mission to express their feelings to their respective crushes, with the sweet help of Ghana Chocolate, a special line produced by Lotte in Japan. This upbeat video perfectly encapsulates the spirit of love, friendship, and sweet confessions during Valentine's season.",
