  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cut off from the world of the living and the realm of the underworld, Miyu, a 14-year-old immortal vampire princess, navigates her life as a middle school student in Japan. Unbeknownst to her classmates, she is destined to track down rogue Shinma, shape-shifting spirits who defy ancient agreements and prey on humans.\n\nMiyu's mission is to banish these evil Shinma from the Earth, but they will not leave their comfortable existence without a fight. Some even conspire to eliminate Miyu and her enigmatic companion, Larva.\n\nLarva, once an evil Shinma himself, now serves as Miyu's devoted guardian. Together, they embark on a dark journey filled with the fragility of the human heart and the tragic loss of innocence.\n\nAs Miyu lives an endless quest to protect humanity, she remains trapped between two worlds, destined for eternal solitude and internal conflict. Despite her ability to offer humans the gift of eternal happiness, she bears no compassion for those she saves. As both the hunter and the hunted, Miyu walks the edge of darkness, one Shinma at a time.",
