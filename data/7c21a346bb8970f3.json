    "text": "Along side his mundane life as a second-year junior high student, Junpei Murao harbors a deep-seated passion for ballet, ignited by a mesmerizing male dancer at his sister's recital years ago. However, societal expectations and the tragic loss of his father forced him to bury his dreams and embrace a more 'manly' persona. One day, everything changes when the enigmatic transfer student, Miyako Godai, notices his hidden love for ballet and invites him to dance with her. Together with Miyako's cousin, Ruou Mori, Junpei embarks on a journey to become a Danseur Noble, the pinnacle of male ballet dancers. As he delves deeper into the beautiful yet unforgiving world of classical ballet, Junpei must confront the sacrifices and challenges that come with pursuing his dreams. Will he have the courage to break free from the constraints of masculinity and fully commit to ballet, even if it means risking friendships and his old life?",
