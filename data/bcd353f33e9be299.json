  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Yotsuya Alphabet tells the surreal tale of a young girl trapped within the confines of a strange town known as Yotsuya. As she wanders the odd landscapes and encounters its bizarre inhabitants, reality and fantasy blur. The girl eventually melts into the fabric of the town itself, calling into question if Yotsuya truly exists or is merely a figment of her imagination. This avant-garde animation emerged from Tokyo University of the Arts in 2010, conjuring a dreamlike world where meaning dissolves like shadows at dusk. Will you too get lost in the puzzle of Yotsuya's winding alleys and find yourself absorbed into its secrets? Let the first letter draw you into the story.",
