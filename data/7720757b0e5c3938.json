    "text": "Makai Realm's demonic entities, known as \"Horrors,\" have infiltrated the human world, preying on souls once the sun sets. In the capital city of Heian-ky≈ç, a spiritual barrier created by the court magi, Onmyouji, provides protection to those residing in the northern part of the city, specifically the palace. However, the commoners living in the southern part of the city are left vulnerable to the nightly onslaught of Horrors.\n\nA small group of warriors emerges, determined to protect the citizens and combat the Horrors throughout the night. Among them is the Golden Knight Raikou, who dons legendary armor and vows to shield everyone from the demonic creatures. Despite his noble intentions, Raikou struggles to manage the armor's side effects and grapples with his own inadequacies.\n\nAccompanied by his attendant Kintoki and the enigmatic Makai Alchemist Seimei, Raikou embarks on a journey of self-discovery to conquer his weaknesses and establish himself as a formidable Makai Knight. As darkness descends, the fate of the city rests on the shoulders of these brave warriors, who stand as the last line of defense against the relentless Horrors.",
