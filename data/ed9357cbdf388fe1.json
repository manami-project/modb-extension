  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Matsunaga Tomomi and Mikage are twin sisters with contrasting personalities and interests. While Tomomi is athletic with a tomboyish style, Mikage is more feminine and academically gifted. What sets them apart is their supernatural psychic connection - they can communicate telepathically and even teleport short distances when together. Though leading seemingly normal school lives - Tomomi excels in sports while Mikage causes the occasional chemistry lab explosion - both girls have romantic troubles. Tomomi tries to make her relationship work despite lacking Mikage's romantic spirit. Meanwhile, Mikage pines for her overseas crush. Their psychic bonds lead the twins into various hijinks and adventures. However, when a possessive princess with ties to an ancient legend appears, the girls soon find themselves embroiled in deeper supernatural troubles than ever before. As the legend begins affecting those around them, the sisters must work together to understand its meaning and protect their friends.",
