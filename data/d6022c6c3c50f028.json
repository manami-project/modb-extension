  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This OVA provides insight into the childhood beginnings of the intense but inspiring rivalry between three gifted young piano prodigies - Kousei Arima, Emi Igawa, and Takeshi Aiza. Centered around their experiences competing at the prestigious Towa Hall, we witness the genesis of their contrasting musical styles and philosophies. Initially, the emotionally raw and impassioned playing of the prodigious Arima enthralls Igawa, while the eccentric Aiza becomes devoted to emulating Arima's emerging precise and technical prowess. As the trio grows and develops, Igawa and Aiza begin targeting Arima in their own unique ways - Igawa longs to draw out Arima's former expressive style with her lively performances, while Aiza transforms his admiration into an ambition to outplay Arima. This illuminating OVA provides intriguing insight into the formative experiences that shaped the complex relationships between these three talented musicians.",
