  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Bridget Satellizer, Rana, and Kazuya, three elite warriors, find themselves in the icy wilderness of Alaska, summoned by the clandestine Chevalier organization. As part of an international coalition of Pandoras, genetically-enhanced women capable of wielding superhuman abilities to combat extra-dimensional aliens known as Nova, they are tasked with evaluating the progress of the Evolution Pandora project. This ambitious initiative aims to artificially transform ordinary girls into powerful Pandoras, a necessity driven by the escalating frequency of Nova attacks and the dwindling number of natural-born Pandoras.\n\nAs the trio navigates this new landscape, they quickly realize that the E-Pandora project is not as straightforward as it appears. With mounting concerns and whispers of unethical experimentation, Satellizer and her loyal Limiter, Kazuya, must uncover the truth behind the project before it's too late. In this high-stakes environment, their combat prowess and unwavering determination will be tested as they strive to protect both their fellow Pandoras and the future of humanity.",
