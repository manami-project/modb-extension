  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It'll take more than words to save Mikihisa Komaki, a dedicated member of the Library Task Force (LTF), when he's falsely accused of violating the rights of a minor. His lifelong friend, Marie Nakazawa, who has been hearing-impaired since middle school, is at the center of the controversy. Komaki's only crime was selecting books for Marie, but the Media Betterment Committee twists this act of kindness into something sinister. As Komaki faces brutal interrogation, the LTF members rally to rescue him, knowing the 'inquiry' is nothing short of torture. In this unaired episode of Toshokan Sensou, it's not just Komaki's fate that hangs in the balance, but also the power of love and friendship to overcome even the most oppressive forces.",
