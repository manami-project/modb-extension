  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around the friendship between Mikihisa Komaki, a member of the Library Task Force (LTF), and Marie Nakazawa, a younger girl who lives in his neighborhood. Despite their age difference, Komaki and Marie have been close friends since Marie was very young. When Marie develops hearing loss in middle school, Komaki supports her by choosing books he thinks she will enjoy. One day, Komaki is suddenly arrested by the Media Betterment Committee and accused of violating a minor's privacy by recommending inappropriate reading material. The LTF members realize the charges are baseless and that Komaki faces torture during the so-called \"inquiry.\" Desperate to save their friend before it's too late, the LTF launches efforts to rescue Komaki from the Betterment Forces' unjust prosecution. At its core, the story explores the strong bond between Komaki and Marie. Their steadfast friendship perseveres through Marie's disability and the Betterment Forces' false allegations against Komaki. The LTF members band together to save their comrade, determined not to let the corrupt Committee break this meaningful connection through fabricated charges and unjust punishment.",
