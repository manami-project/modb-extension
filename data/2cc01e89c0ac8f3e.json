    "text": "On a distant planet far from Earth, there lies a kingdom filled with smiling faces called Soleil. Here we meet Princess Yuuki, a bright-eyed 12-year-old on the cusp of adolescence. She leads a joyful life in the royal palace, though she grapples with the emotional ups and downs of her age. Yuuki is supported by her band of loyal vassals like her tutor Reira, her political advisor Izana, the leader of her chivalry Harold, and her childhood best friend Joshua. However, Yuuki's carefree world is shattered when she learns of a grave threat - the neighboring Empire of Grandiga has set its sights on conquering Soleil. As war looms, the odds seem stacked against the small kingdom. On the other side of the conflict stands 17-year-old Stella, a skilled and reserved soldier fighting for Grandiga. Though cool and collected in battle, Stella always wears a smile, believing it essential for living life to the fullest. With the destinies of two girls intertwined across opposing sides of war, the fate of Soleil and Grandiga hangs in the balance. Can Yuuki's optimism prevail against Stella's might? This story follows the clash between two young women born worlds apart.",
