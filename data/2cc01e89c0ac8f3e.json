    "text": "Yuuki, a 12-year-old princess, resides in a faraway kingdom where smiles are abundant. As she approaches adolescence, she experiences a whirlwind of emotions, ranging from tears to laughter and the occasional heart-pounding excitement. Amidst the royal palace's vibrant atmosphere, Yuuki's days are enriched by her devoted vassals, including her tutor Reira, political advisor Izana, chivalrous leader Harold, and her childhood friend and confidant, Joshua. Meanwhile, Stella, a 17-year-old soldier from another distant planet, exudes a reserved demeanor yet maintains an ever-present smile, as she believes it to be essential to life. This tale weaves the lives of these two young women, each hailing from distinct worlds, as they navigate their unique challenges and discover the true power of a smile.",
