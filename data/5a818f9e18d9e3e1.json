  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Subaru Sumeragi is a compassionate 16-year-old onmyouji (spiritual medium) living in 1990s Tokyo with his upbeat twin sister Hokuto. As the future head of the esteemed Sumeragi clan, Subaru uses his spiritual powers to help ghosts find peace. He is aided in this task by Hokuto, who supports him wholeheartedly, and their mysterious friend Seishirō, a veterinarian who is strangely always available to join the twins. Though inherently kind-hearted, Subaru takes on more than he can handle as he works to resolve the many spiritual conflicts plaguing the desperate people of Tokyo. Hokuto worries the pain Subaru absorbs from those he helps will break his gentle spirit. She tries to set him up with Seishirō, hoping love will give her selfless brother something to live for outside his spiritual duties. However, Seishirō may be hiding a darker side behind his helpful demeanor. As urban decay and spiritual unrest threaten to tear Tokyo apart, Subaru must find the strength within himself to face the growing darkness. The decisions he makes will determine not just his own fate, but the fate of the entire city.",
