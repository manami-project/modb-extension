    "text": "Konohamaru, the grandson of the Third Hokage, has developed feelings for a girl named Kaede Yoshino. However, Kaede is set to move away from the Hidden Leaf Village, leaving Konohamaru distraught. In an effort to make her stay, he seeks out the legendary crimson four-leaf clover which is rumored to grant wishes. Konohamaru recruits Naruto and forms a team called the Konoha Corps to find the clover. They are told it can be found in the treacherous Akagahara, site of the old Chunin Exams. Along with Sakura and Sasuke, Naruto and Konohamaru bravely set out on this dangerous mission into the unknown wilderness. They hope to locate the mystical plant so that Konohamaru can wish for Kaede to remain in the village. But unseen perils await any who enter Akagahara seeking the clover. Will the team successfully find the legendary item, or will they fall prey to lurking threats? Either way, Konohamaru is willing to risk everything for his chance at love.",
