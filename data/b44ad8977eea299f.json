  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jun is a high school student who finds himself magically transformed into an actual girl after mixing several magic spells. As a girl, Jun experiences an unexpected rise in popularity, with many boys at school suddenly chasing after him asking for a kiss. It seems Jun's magical transformation has made him more charming and irresistible than any normal girl. While Jun is initially thrilled to have his dreams come true, the immense strength of the magic spells soon becomes problematic. Overnight, Jun goes from being just another student to the most sought-after girl in school. This sudden and overwhelming attention threatens to spiral out of control. As Jun navigates his newfound – but temporary – female identity, he gains an eye-opening perspective on what it's like to walk in someone else's shoes. This comedic tale explores gender roles, relationships, and the magic that happens when you make someone's dreams come true, even if just for a day.",
