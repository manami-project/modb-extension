    "text": "Miyuki, a charming 16-minute Christmas special, is a prelude to the first season of Ai yori Aoshi: Enishi. Based on manga chapters 43 and 44, this episode could easily slot in as the midpoint between episodes 21 and 22 of the initial season.\n\nKaoru, a college student struggling to balance his finances, has recently moved out of the Hanabishi residence. As the festive season of Christmas approaches, an unusual pendant falls from the sky, striking him on the head. In a dreamlike sequence, Kaoru wakes up to find a captivating woman claiming to be Santa Claus. This mysterious woman bears an uncanny resemblance to Aoi, a girl from Kaoru's past.\n\nAs a token of gratitude for returning her pendant, the enigmatic Santa agrees to spend Christmas with Kaoru. The episode unfolds with Kaoru affectionately addressing her as the girl he once knew, adding a nostalgic touch to their time together. As they celebrate the holiday season, viewers are left with a heartwarming tale of connection and reminiscence.",
