  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set as a Christmas special before the events of the first season, Ai yori Aoshi: Enishi - Miyuki focuses on Kaoru Hanabishi and a chance encounter one winter's eve. Struggling to make ends meet since leaving home and entering college, Kaoru is surprised when a pendant mysteriously falls from the sky, striking him. That night, he awakens to find a beautiful young woman introducing herself as Santa Claus. To show her gratitude for Kaoru returning her lost pendant, \"Santa\" offers to spend Christmas with him. As the two spend time together, there are hints that this mysterious Santa may not be exactly as she seems. With nods to Kaoru's past and the spirit of the holiday season, this special episode provides a sweet prequel to the full series. Though brief, it offers insight into the main character while setting an uplifting, romantic tone.",
