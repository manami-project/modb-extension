    "text": "First-year high school student Himari Kino attends the opening ceremony concert performed by upperclassman Yori Asanagi's band. Captivated by the music, Himari enthusiastically confesses her apparent love to Yori after the show. Caught off guard, Yori decides she wants to reciprocate Himari's feelings. However, Himari soon clarifies that she admires Yori's musical talents rather than harboring romantic interest. Determined, Yori sets out to make Himari fall for her instead of just her music. As the passionate musician attempts to woo the energetic younger girl, their relationship grows complicated. While Yori's feelings turn romantic, Himari remains focused on the craft and skill behind Yori's songs. This comedic drama follows the two students as they explore the blurry lines between admiration, friendship, and love. Yori refuses to give up on winning over Himari's heart. But will Himari ever see past the melodies to the girl behind the guitar? Or will their feelings continue to fall out of tune?",
