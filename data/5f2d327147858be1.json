  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keppi, a peculiar kappa-like entity, crosses paths with three middle school students, Kazuki Yasaka, Toi Kuji, and Enta Jinnai, in the heart of Asakusa. When their mythical shirikodama organs are stolen, the boys find themselves transformed into kappas. Keppi presents them with a single mission to regain their human forms: connect with one another and seize the shirikodama from the roaming zombies. As the trio grapples with their new reality, a separate narrative unfolds at a nearby police box, where officers Reo Niiboshi and Mabu Akutsu find themselves entangled in their own mysterious affair. This tale weaves together the journey of three boys, each struggling to form meaningful bonds with those dearest to them, as they uncover the true essence of connection.",
