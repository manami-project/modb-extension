  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The stage is set in the Asakusa district of Tokyo, where three second-year middle school students - Kazuki Yasaka, Toi Kuji, and Enta Jinnai - have a fateful encounter. They inadvertently anger a self-proclaimed kappa prince named Keppi, who steals a mythical organ from each of them called a shirikodama. This transforms the boys into kappas themselves. To return to human form, Keppi informs them that they must fight off zombie-like creatures called Kapa-zombies that are plaguing the city. By working together and connecting with each other, the boys can extract the shirikodama from these zombies. However, they struggle to connect at first, as their deep secrets are revealed each time they try. As the boys fight to collect these shirikodama, they begin to bond and realize the true meaning of connections. All the while, two policemen named Reo and Mabu seem to be tangled up in the kappa kingdom conspiracy as well. This fantastical tale blends action and drama as three disconnected youths uncover what it takes to truly link with others - mind, body and personal truths. Along the way, the fragility and preciousness of human bonds come to light.",
