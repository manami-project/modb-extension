  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hayami Ayame, the last surviving member of the Kasumi ninja clan, witnesses the devastation of her village in 1580s Japan, orchestrated by the ruthless half-demon warlord Nobunaga Oda. Armed with one of three mystical weapons, a divine dagger, Ayame embarks on a perilous journey to avenge her family and prevent Nobunaga's tyrannical conquest.\n\nJoined by fellow renegade ninjas Sakon and Ryoma, who wield the remaining sacred sword and spear, the trio must combine their skills and unite their enchanted blades to fulfill an ancient prophecy. According to legend, when a comet splits the sky, a dark god will rise, and only the united power of the three blades can vanquish the impending evil.\n\nAs Nobunaga's malevolent forces, including the inhuman Host of Oboro, continue to annihilate everything in their path, Ayame, Sakon, and Ryoma face insurmountable odds. With fate guiding their alliance, these shadow warriors must decide if their cause is worth the ultimate sacrifice, for only together can they stand against the looming darkness that threatens to consume Japan.",
