    "text": "State Prison, a facility ruled by four formidable inmates known as The Four Emperors. Each emperor exerts control over a separate block, creating a hierarchy that keeps the rest of the prisoners in check.\n\nRiki-Oh, undeterred by the power dynamics, challenges the authority of The Four Emperors. Among them is Hai, a tattooed knife-wielding leader who operates his block like a mafia family. Then there's Tarzan, a colossal man with unmatched strength. Huang Chaun, the third emperor, is an effeminate fighter who cultivates opium within the prison walls. The final member is a diminutive man who wields sewing needles as deadly weapons.\n\nAs society outside crumbles under ecological disasters and oppressive regimes, Riki-Oh must navigate the treacherous world inside the prison. With his extraordinary strength and unyielding spirit, he fights against the tyranny of The Four Emperors, sparking a battle that will determine the fate of the entire prison. Will Riki-Oh's quest for justice prevail, or will he succumb to the ruthless power struggles within the prison walls?",
