  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When 30-year-old bachelor Daikichi attends his grandfather's funeral, he is shocked to learn that the old man had an illegitimate 6-year-old daughter named Rin with a younger lover. The rest of Daikichi's family is embarrassed by this revelation and wants nothing to do with the silent little girl. Outraged by their cold reaction, Daikichi spontaneously decides to adopt Rin himself, despite having no experience with parenting or children. As Daikichi takes on the new role of Rin's guardian, he struggles to balance parenting with his job and personal life. Enrolling Rin in school, buying her clothes, and teaching her about the world are just some of the challenges he faces. He also tries to help the grieving Rin cope with her father's death and her abandonment by her mother. Despite many bumps along the road, an unlikely father-daughter relationship blossoms between the mismatched pair as they learn to navigate life together. Though becoming an instant parent to the withdrawn Rin is difficult, Daikichi discovers the struggles and rewards of parenthood. His once quiet life now filled with a child's joys, cares, and questions.",
