    "text": "This anime, Aoki Densetsu Shoot!, follows the journey of three high school freshmen—Toshihiko Tanaka, Kenji Shiraishi, and Kazuhiro Hiramatsu—who share a passion for soccer and a strong bond of friendship. Known as the Kakenishi golden trio in their junior high school days, they transformed their school's soccer team into a formidable opponent. Inspired by the incredible feats of their idol, Yoshiharu Kubo, the trio enrolls at Kakegawa High, a school established just a year prior. Kubo, a remarkable soccer player, led Kakegawa High's soccer club to a top-eight finish in their prefecture during their debut appearance, almost single-handedly. Despite receiving offers from various international soccer clubs, Kubo remains committed to guiding Kakegawa High to the All-Japan High School Championship. As the trio embarks on their high school soccer journey, they face numerous challenges, romantic entanglements, and heart-wrenching losses. Along the way, they strive to rekindle their former glory and become the best high school soccer team in Japan, ultimately aiming to create a legendary legacy.",
