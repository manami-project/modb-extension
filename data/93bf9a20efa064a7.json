    "text": "Cross Academy Town is abuzz with excitement as the grand festival, held only once every 11 years, approaches. Amidst the joyful chaos, Okumura Rin is tasked with a critical mission: to suppress the rampaging Phantom Train, a demon threatening the town's protective barriers. During his mission, Rin encounters an unexpected ally in the form of a young boy, who is, in fact, a demon. Meanwhile, Cheng-Long Liu, a Senior Exorcist First Class from the Taiwan Branch, teams up with Shura to repair the damaged barriers, leading to an unexpected turn of events as their destinies intertwine. Rin's journey to become an exorcist is fueled by his desire to avenge his adopted father's death at the hands of his biological father, Satan, and to wage war against his own demonic kin. As Rin and his companions navigate the challenges of the Phantom Train and the mysterious boy demon, they must confront their own demons and protect the town from the looming threat of the underworld.",
