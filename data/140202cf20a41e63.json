    "text": "Yo Satou, a 15-year-old high school student and avid SEGA fan, stumbles into an unexpected world of chaos and competition when he attempts to purchase a half-priced bento box from his local supermarket. After being knocked unconscious and waking up to find the discounted meals gone, Satou discovers a hidden realm where grocery stores transform into battlegrounds as \"Wolves\" fiercely fight for the coveted half-priced bentos.\n\nDetermined not to be a defeated \"Dog,\" Satou joins the Half-Priced Food Lovers Club under the guidance of Sen Yarizui, the silver-haired \"Ice Queen\" and skilled Wolf. Alongside Hana Oshiroi, a fellow club member who enjoys observing the bento brawls, Satou learns the true meaning of fighting for his dinner. As he trains to become a formidable Wolf, Satou competes against other fighters, including his half-cousin Ayame Shaga, to secure a place at the top of the bento battle hierarchy.\n\nIn this thrilling anime, Satou's journey reveals the lengths people will go to for a discounted meal, as friendships are tested, and alliances are formed in the ultimate fight for survival and sustenance. Will Satou rise to become a powerful Wolf or remain a hungry Dog in this relentless world of bento wars?",
