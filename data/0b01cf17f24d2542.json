    "text": "Typhoon Noruda's director, Yojiro Arai, and Penguin Highway's character designer have teamed up to create a captivating animated short film for Kagome's 'GO!ME.' initiative, which promotes the company's line of ONE DAY and AOJIL vegetable drinks. Titled 'Natsu no Niwa' (Summer Garden), this imaginative film marks the first independent anime produced by Arai's newly established studio, FILMONY.\n\nThe story follows Mea, a young girl who stumbles upon a peculiar stuffed animal possessing an unusual power. One summer day, her life takes a dramatic turn when her personal gravity field inexplicably reverses, leading her on a thrilling and bizarre adventure. As the city around her turns upside-down, Mea must navigate this new reality.\n\nAccompanying the three-minute film is the song 'HEY HEY HO' by ENJOY MUSIC CLUB, featuring singer and songwriter Sachie Hiraga. The GO!ME project, which sponsors 'youth who are going their own way,' has collaborated with various artists, including dancers, musicians, tech innovators, and animators, with this short film being one of its standout creations. Prepare to be enthralled by Mea's gravity-defying journey in this visually stunning and engaging anime.",
