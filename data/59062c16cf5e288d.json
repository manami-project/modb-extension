The series follows Hajime, a young boy with a passion for the game and a love of his favorite rice topping, as he embarks on a journey to become the ultimate Battle Spirits champion.

From birds and insects to dragons and demons, these spirits are now more real than ever before.\n\nAs Hajime travels the world to compete in tournaments and hone his skills, he encounters a diverse cast of characters, each with their own unique cards and strategies. With the introduction of a new type of card called Burst, the stakes are higher than ever before, and Hajime must rely on his wits, his friends, and his fated card to come out on top. Will he be able to become the champion he's always dreamed of being, or will he fall short in the face of fierce competition? Only time will tell in this exciting and action-packed anime series.",
