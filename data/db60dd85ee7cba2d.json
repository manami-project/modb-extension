    "text": "Chocolat Cadabra is a fantastical short film that celebrates the magic of chocolate. Directed by acclaimed animator You Yoshinari for the 60th anniversary of Lotte's confectionery business, it whisks viewers away to a wondrous chocolate factory after hours. We follow three adventurous girls as they traverse worlds of science, sorcery, and imagination in search of the secret \"spell\" that makes chocolate so utterly delicious. Through gorgeous animation and whimsical storytelling, Chocolat Cadabra captures chocolate's enduring power to thrill, comfort, and bring joy to our lives. As the intrepid heroes chant the magical incantation “Chocolat Cadabra!,” we're reminded that somewhere, a chocolate-lover is surely experiencing these wonders too. This celebratory tale will cast its delicious spell on anyone who loves chocolate and creative storytelling alike.",
