  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rumi Yokoi is a diligent student who wants nothing more than to focus during class. However, she is constantly distracted by her neighbor Toshinari Seki, who spends all his time creating intricate games and setups at his desk. Seki obsessively crafts detailed dominoes courses, dramatic war scenes with shogi pieces, and other absorbing diversions, paying no attention to the teacher. Despite her irritation, Yokoi finds Seki's pastimes oddly fascinating, even as her attention wanders. Try as she might to resist, Yokoi inevitably gets sucked into Seki's eccentric hobbies. While he somehow escapes every situation unscathed, Yokoi repeatedly ends up in trouble for not paying attention in class. Seki's antics inject daily chaos into the classroom, constantly challenging Yokoi's determination to concentrate. But with his ingenious distractions, school days are never dull.",
