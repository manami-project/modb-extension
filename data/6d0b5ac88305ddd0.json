  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kou Ichinomiya is a wealthy elite who firmly believes in never being indebted to anyone. However, after a mishap where he loses his pants and falls into the Arakawa River, he is rescued by Nino, an eccentric girl living under the bridge. To repay his life debt, the reluctant Kou agrees to help Nino fulfill her desire to \"experience love.\" Kou moves into the cardboard box Nino calls home and is introduced to Arakawa's offbeat community of river dwellers. This includes a hot-headed kappa, a cross-dressing nun, and an actual rock star. Stripped of his life of privilege, Kou must now adapt to his unorthodox new surroundings and neighbors, all while attempting to understand the enigmatic Nino's concept of love. Despite the culture shock, Kou honorably commits to settling his debt to Nino. Yet the more entangled they become, the more Kou realizes he may have bargained for far more than he ever imagined. Their quirky connection could lead to experiences and relationships Kou never thought possible under the bridge.",
