  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Asking for help is something that the affluent and self-reliant Ko Ichinomiya has never had to do, thanks to his family's steadfast motto: 'Never be indebted to anyone.' However, after an unexpected tumble into the Arakawa River and a wardrobe malfunction, Ko finds himself in an unfamiliar positionâ€”owing his life to a mysterious girl named Nino. Living under the bridge, Nino is no ordinary savior; she is a charming yet eccentric individual who claims to hail from Venus. In an attempt to repay his debt, Ko promises to assist Nino in her quest to experience love. Little does he know, this simple promise will lead him to cross paths with an array of unconventional river dwellers, including a fiery kappa, a drag-performing Sister, and a bona fide rockstar. Say goodbye to your comfortable life, Ko, because after falling into that river, you've truly plunged headfirst into a world of chaos and unpredictability!",
