    "text": "Keijo, a unique and lucrative sport, has captured the attention of millions in Japan. The rules are simple yet unconventional: female athletes compete on floating platforms, aiming to dislodge their opponents using only their chests and buttocks. Enter Nozomi Kaminashi, a 17-year-old gymnast with extraordinary skills and a dream to lift her family out of poverty. Shunning college offers from prestigious gymnastics programs, Nozomi dives headfirst into the world of Keijo, hoping to claim the hefty prize money. As she navigates the intense world of this peculiar sport, Nozomi must rely on her agility, strength, and determination to outmaneuver her rivals and secure a brighter future for her family. Will she rise to the top and become the next Keijo champion? Only time will tell.",
