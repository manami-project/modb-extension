  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ever curious about the human world, four tiny fairies named Kururu, Chiriri, Sarara, and Hororo embark on a journey to immerse themselves in human life. Hailing from a magical realm, they reside in vibrant, enchanted bottles on their human companion's desk, a university student they affectionately call \"Sensei-san.\"\n\nEach fairy boasts a unique personality: Kururu, the bubbly and energetic one; Chiriri, the refined and feminine spirit; Sarara, the tomboy with a samurai obsession; and Hororo, the quiet yet eccentric fairy. Together, they strive to understand the human world and its customs, with dreams of becoming human themselves.\n\nIn their quest for knowledge, they receive guidance from Sensei-san and a first-grade girl they befriend, Tama-chan. Despite their limited understanding and occasional misconceptions, these adorable fairies embrace the human experience wholeheartedly.\n\nAs the fairies navigate through various aspects of human life, such as graduation ceremonies, sports festivals, and even romance, they learn and grow from their daily adventures and misadventures. With the end of their year-long study approaching, they must determine if they have learned enough to fulfill their dreams of becoming human.",
