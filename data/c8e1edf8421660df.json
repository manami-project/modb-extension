  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kururu, Chiriri, Sarara, and Hororo are four colorful fairies who arrive in the human world from the fairy world, each residing in their own magical bottles. Entranced by human culture after reading human magazines back home, their greatest wish is to become human themselves. Under the guidance of their kind neighbor \"Sensei-san,\" the bubbly fairies slowly acclimate to human life as they experience different traditions, holidays, and activities. However, with their limited knowledge, the fairies often misunderstand things at first or get themselves into silly situations. They receive additional questionable advice from a naive grade schooler named Tama. As the fairies' year of study draws to an end, they've grown to love life in the human world. But have they learned enough to make their dream of becoming human a reality? Through heartwarming fun each day, the four fairies continue working hard, forging friendships, and finding wonder in everything the human world has to offer.",
