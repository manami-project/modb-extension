  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, Kazami Yuuji, a transfer student, arrives at Mihama Academy, an institution that appears to be a typical school but functions more as a sanctuary for students who struggle to adapt to the outside world. The academy houses only five other students, all of whom are girls with troubled pasts. As Yuuji interacts with each girl, he uncovers their hidden traumas and seeks to help them overcome their emotional scars. However, the true reason behind Yuuji's arrival at this peculiar institution remains shrouded in mystery. Will Yuuji be the catalyst that helps these girls reclaim their lives, or will the weight of their pasts be too much to bear? And what secrets does Yuuji himself hold? Only time will tell as the story unfolds within the walls of Mihama Academy.",
