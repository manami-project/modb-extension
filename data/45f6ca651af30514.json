  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Makimura, a crew member of a spaceship hailing from the distant planet Zaltz, meets an untimely end amidst a complex web of love and rivalry in the year A.D. 2577. Stranded in the cosmos after a devastating crash into cosmic dust, the remaining crew awakens from hibernation to find their colleague's mummified body. With the spaceship inoperable, they flee in escape pods, only to discover that Makimura's pod is eerily tailing them, yet unresponsive to their attempts at contact.\n\nAs they float aimlessly in space, the crew grapples with the recent murder case involving Makimura, who was entangled in a love triangle with fellow crewmates Kizaki and Nana Ichinomiya. The mystery deepens when they crash-land on a seemingly abandoned planet, where they must confront the unsettling truth about Makimura and his enigmatic escape pod.\n\nBased on Tezuka Osamu's original story, this third installment of 'The Phoenix' series unveils the harsh realities of human desire and the ruthless consequences of love through the plight of these astronauts, who are doomed to drift through the universe after losing their mother ship.",
