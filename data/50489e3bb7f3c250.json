    "text": "Seno Aiko, Fujiwara Hazuki, and Harukaze Doremi, three ordinary girls, find their lives taking an extraordinary turn when they stumble upon the enigmatic Mahou-Dou, a magic shop hidden in plain sight. The shop's mysterious owner, Majorika, is accidentally transformed into a green blob by Doremi, forcing the pink-haired girl to become a witch's apprentice to reverse the spell. As Doremi delves deeper into the world of magic, her friends, Hazuki and Aiko, join her on this magical journey, becoming apprentices themselves to protect Doremi's secret.\n\nAs they navigate the trials and tribulations of everyday life, the trio must also balance their newfound magical responsibilities. From studying for magical exams to running the Mahou-Dou, now rebranded as 'Maho-dou,' these apprentices have their work cut out for them. Despite their initial struggles, the girls find solace and strength in their friendship, working together to overcome the challenges that come their way.\n\nWith a mix of humor, heart, and a dash of magic, 'Unskilled Witch Doremi' follows the adventures of these young apprentices as they strive to become full-fledged witches. Will they pass their exams, master their magical abilities, and restore Majorika to her human form? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: this enchanting tale will leave you spellbound.",
