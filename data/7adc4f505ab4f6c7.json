  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dangerous, high-stakes missions aren't usually the domain of traffic cops, but for Maki, Reimi, and Yuka, their routine patrol takes a dramatic turn when they stumble upon a sinister sex-slave ring run by a powerful and politically connected businessman. When Yuka is tragically kidnapped and the rest of the police force is too intimidated to act, it's up to Maki and Reimi to take matters into their own hands. Armed with cutting-edge battle armor, heavy weaponry, and an indomitable spirit, the duo embarks on a daring rescue mission to save their friend and bring down the criminal organization. With the odds stacked against them, Maki and Reimi must prove that they have what it takes to put an end to the corrupt slave trade and bring Yuka home safe. Will they succeed, or will they become the next victims of this ruthless operation? Only time will tell in this thrilling, action-packed anime.",
