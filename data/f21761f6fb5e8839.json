  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tsumiki Miniwa, a petite and feisty high school student, finds herself in a complex web of emotions as she grapples with her feelings for her best friend, Io Otonashi. Io, tall and laid-back, seems oblivious to Tsumiki's growing affection, leaving her in a state of perpetual confusion and irritation. Their circle of friends, including the prankster duo Mayoi and Sakaki, and the somewhat detached Hime, only add fuel to the fire, teasing Tsumiki relentlessly about her crush. As Tsumiki navigates through her daily life, she must find the courage to express her true feelings and potentially risk the friendship she cherishes. This heartwarming anime explores the intricacies of young love and the dynamics of friendship in 'Place to Place'.",
