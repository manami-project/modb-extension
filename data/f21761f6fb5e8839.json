  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tsumiki is a petite, shy high school girl who has developed romantic feelings for her best friend Io, a tall and easygoing boy. However, Io seems oblivious to Tsumiki's budding affection despite their close friendship. This leaves Tsumiki confused and frustrated as she tries to navigate her changing relationship with Io. Tsumiki's circle of eccentric friends - including the mischievous pranksters Mayoi and Sakaki, naive daydreamer Hime, and stoic electronics nerd Sakaki - notice her crush on Io. They constantly tease Tsumiki about her feelings, though their playful meddling usually leaves her more flustered. As Tsumiki interacts with Io and their friends in her daily school life, she grapples with uncertainty over Io's true feelings for her. She worries about risking their precious friendship by confessing her love. Yet there are moments when Io's affectionate behavior gives her hope. Will the shy Tsumiki work up the nerve to share her heart with Io? Or will the oblivious Io forever miss the affection that Tsumiki wishes he would notice? This heartwarming anime follows a group of friends as two of them navigate the thin line between platonic friendship and young romance.",
