  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is 1919 in Tokyo, and the city faces a looming threat from demonic forces. To combat this, a special defense force called the Imperial Floral Assault Team is established, consisting entirely of young women with unique spiritual abilities. Operating under the guise of a theater troupe, these girls pilot advanced steam-powered mechas to fend off demon attacks. The team includes the likes of Kanna, a tough karate expert; Maria, a Russian weapons specialist; young French psychic Iris; Chinese mechanic Li; Sumire, the spoiled heiress funding their tech; and Sakura, a sweet country girl wielding a powerful sword. Despite their diverse talents, the girls struggle with teamwork. When a new wave of demons threatens Tokyo, a new commander named Ichirou takes charge to whip the dysfunctional team into shape both on and off stage, directing them to perform A Midsummer Night's Dream. With the city's fate hanging in the balance, can Ichirou transform this group of clashing personalities into a cohesive fighting force able to defeat the invading demons?",
