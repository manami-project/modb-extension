  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Found in the hands of Inuyasha, the dormant Sou'unga, a sword of immense power and wrath, has awakened after 700 years. This blade, once wielded by Inuyasha's father, the Great Dog Demon, was sealed away alongside its two counterparts, the Tetsusaiga and Tensaiga, which have been bequeathed to his sons, Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru respectively.\n\nNow, with the Sou'unga's malevolent spirit unleashed, the two brothers must set aside their deep-rooted rivalry and join forces to prevent the sword's destructive power from wreaking havoc on mankind. As they embark on this perilous journey, they find themselves in a race against time, with Inuyasha striving to master the Sou'unga before it masters him, and Sesshoumaru determined to claim the sword for himself.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the true nature and purpose of the Sou'unga remain shrouded in mystery, leaving Inuyasha and Sesshoumaru to unravel the secrets of their father's legacy and confront the unimaginable power that lies within the blade. Will they be able to put aside their differences and work together, or will the Sou'unga's evil spirit consume them both? The fate of humanity hangs in the balance.",
