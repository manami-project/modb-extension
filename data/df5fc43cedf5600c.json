  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dynamic Chord follows the professional and personal journeys of four popular Japanese boy bands signed to the same music agency. RÃªve Parfait is known for its progressive rock sound and unique worldview. Liar-S is an emo rock band gaining attention as an emerging group. KYOSO is comprised of polished veteran performers at the height of fame. Apple-Polisher fuses dance and rock elements as the agency's internationally successful sensation. Over the course of a year, the documentary-style anime provides an inside look at the 16 members of these bands as they navigate the entertainment industry. It realistically depicts their encounters, relationships, breakups, and ongoing quest for musical success across the backdrop of Japan's four seasons. Viewers can expect to connect with multifaceted characters as the boys put everything on the line in pursuit of their rock star dreams. Backstage drama and onstage glory come together in a musical slice-of-life.",
