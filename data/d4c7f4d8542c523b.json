  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kagura Uzuki and Tsubame Ouse join a specialized military task force, Trinary, in an anime that uniquely blends elements of gaming and animation. In a Tokyo plagued by abnormalities known as Phenomenon, these false realities distort the affected areas and can only be dispelled by defeating or appeasing their creators. Trinary's mission is to disperse these Phenomenon and maintain the delicate balance between their everyday lives and their superhero responsibilities. As the girls confront each new Phenomenon, they come to understand that their own reality is not without its own challenges. By connecting with the Clan, individuals who engage with both the smartphone game and anime, Trinary's heroines gain the power necessary to face these trials head-on.",
