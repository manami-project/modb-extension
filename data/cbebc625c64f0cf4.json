  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nagasaki and Hiroshima's tragic past and the devastating aftermath of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami are intertwined in Hirabayashi Isamu's thought-provoking anime short, 663114. The story unfolds through the poignant monologue of a 66-year-old cicada, who emerges from a long slumber with a singular goal: to ascend to great heights, unfurl its wings, and ensure the survival of its progeny.\n\nAs the cicada embarks on its mission, it draws striking parallels between its own existence and the catastrophic events that have befallen humanity. The numbers 66, 3, 11, and 4 hold significant meaning, representing the years since the atomic bombings, the date of the Tohoku earthquake, and the number of radiation-emitting reactors from the Fukushima Daiichi plant.\n\nThis profound and moving narrative, which earned the Noburou Oofuji Award at the Mainichi Film Awards in 2012, compels viewers to confront the harsh realities of our world and ponder the future we are creating for generations to come. 663114 is a powerful reminder of the delicate balance between life and destruction, as seen through the eyes of a humble yet resilient cicada.",
