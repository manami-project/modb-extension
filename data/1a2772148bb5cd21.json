  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over the ages, the tranquil coexistence of humans and monsters on Naral Island has been repeatedly disrupted by the resurrection of the menacing Demon King. Fortunately, with each rebirth, a valiant hero emerges to vanquish the demonic tyrant. In anticipation of the next resurrection, four young girls—Yusha, Seyla, Fai, and Mei—attend an adventurer's academy to hone their skills and form a heroic party. However, their carefree lives and seemingly endless procrastination belie the gravity of their mission. Unbeknownst to them, their enemy is closer than they think, as the Demon King has been reincarnated as a child and infiltrated the school as a teacher. With the cycle of resurrection and defeat poised to repeat, the stakes have never been higher for these unsuspecting heroines-in-training. Will they rise to the challenge and fulfill their destinies, or will they succumb to the deceptive tranquility of their everyday lives? Only time will tell in this thrilling and unpredictable tale of magic, swords, and adventure.",
