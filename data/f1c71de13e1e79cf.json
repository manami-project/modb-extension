  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earth meets Hell in the unlikeliest of ways when Yurine Hanazono, a college student with a flair for the occult, accidentally summons a demon girl named Jashin-chan. With cobra-like tail and devilish charm, Jashin-chan is now stuck on Earth, forced to live with Yurine in her humble abode. The catch? Jashin-chan can only return to Hell if she kills her summoner, but Yurine's knack for punishment and an arsenal of weapons keeps the incompetent demon at bay. Amidst the chaos, Jashin-chan's demon friends, the gentle Medusa and lively Minosu, add a dash of humor and disapproval to the bizarre roommate situation. Brace yourself for a darkly comedic ride as this odd duo navigates their twisted cat-and-mouse relationship in \"Jashin-chan Dropkick.\"",
