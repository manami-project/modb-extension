    "text": "After a dramatic motorcycle race, Makina lost control of an advanced Machina suit, causing her to faint and Kotaro to crash. Dan managed to safely get Makina away on his bike, only to then encounter Mitsukuni Hyuga, chairman of the Hyuga Corporation which developed the suits. Expecting to lose his job for involving the heir Kotaro, Dan is surprised when instead Mitsukuni offers Makina a chance to uncover the truth about her parents' deaths and their work on the Machina project. Though hesitant to revisit his childhood trauma, Dan is encouraged by Makina to seek answers. Their friend Sanae also tries helping Dan and Makina through this difficult situation. Now at a crossroads, Dan must decide whether to face his painful past in order to move forward freely into the future. The destinies of Dan, Makina and Kotaro remain closely intertwined, with new revelations set to emerge that will propel the next part of their journey.",
