  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ream Stream, a Time Patrol agent from the future, crosses paths with Bon Namihira, an unremarkable junior high school student. Alongside a peculiar creature called Buyoyon, the Time Patrol agents work to save those who have met untimely deaths that don't drastically change the course of history. As the memories of anyone who sees Ream and her team are erased, it comes as a surprise when Bon's memory remains unaffected. As a result, Bon is recruited as a Time Patrol agent-in-training.\n\nThrilled by the prospect of using futuristic tools like the 'time boat' that can traverse time and space, Bon teams up with Ream to carry out their missions. Though he occasionally gets carried away, Bon's experiences allow him to connect with the lives of people who lived wisely throughout history. Join Bon on an extraordinary journey across Earth and the annals of humanity as he becomes Tãƒ»P BON, a time-traveling agent dedicated to saving lives during significant historical events.",
