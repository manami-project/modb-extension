However, her life takes a dramatic turn when she witnesses Lal'C Melk Mark, an elite psychic pilot known as a 'Topless,' battling a space monster with her Buster Machine, Dix-Neuf. Nono discovers her own super-strength when she helps Lal'C defeat the alien, and from that moment on, she is determined to join the ranks of Topless alongside her newfound 'big sister.' Together with their teammates Nicholas and Chiko, Nono and Lal'C must hone their skills and protect humanity from the ongoing intergalactic war against hordes of space monsters.
