    "text": "After a harrowing experience with a malevolent spirit left him with a cursed hand, Keitarou Gentouga, a college freshman with the ability to communicate with ghosts, became a recluse, shunning the supernatural world. However, with the support of his childhood friend, Eiko Houzuki, Keitarou steps back into society as a private tutor. His first student is none other than Eiko's cousin, Yayoi Houzuki, a child prodigy with an unusual gift - two pupils in each eye that allow her to perceive spirits.\n\nYayoi, driven by the loss of her parents and the mysterious disappearance of her mother's spirit, is determined to capture malevolent spirits, hoping to find the one responsible for her tragedy. Recognizing Keitarou's potential as a spirit medium, she enlists his help, pulling him back into the chilling world of spectral encounters he had tried to escape.\n\nAs they embark on this perilous journey, Keitarou, despite his reluctance and fear, finds himself drawn into Yayoi's quest, encountering a myriad of grotesque supernatural phenomena. With each new spirit they meet, Keitarou's resolve is tested, yet he continues, hoping to help Yayoi find the answers she seeks. This chilling tale of courage, friendship, and supernatural encounters promises to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.",
