    "text": "Her life was as ordinary as any other 12-year-old's, until Nina Yamada mistakenly consumes a magical artifact, the Crystal Pearl, believing it to be a simple piece of candy. This seemingly insignificant act thrusts her into the midst of a high-stakes competition among aspiring magicians from another realm. The Crystal Pearl serves as the ultimate test for these sorcerers, and whoever successfully retrieves it will earn the esteemed title of a professional wizard.\n\nNow, with Nina unwittingly becoming the focal point of this magical contest, she finds herself in desperate need of the very protection she's always dreamt of - just like the princesses in her beloved storybooks. Enter Zero and Ichii, two dashing young magicians who pledge to safeguard her until the exam concludes.\n\nAs the trio navigates the treacherous path fraught with countless adversaries vying for the Crystal Pearl, Nina's everyday life takes a chaotic turn. With her newfound guardians never leaving her side, even school becomes a battleground. Will Nina manage to maintain her sanity amidst the relentless pursuit of both envious competitors and the two charming protectors who have invaded her life? Join Nina, Zero, and Ichii in this enchanting tale of magic, protection, and unexpected friendships.",
