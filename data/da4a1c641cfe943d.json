  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To protect a secret war waged by magi for the omnipotent Holy Grail, ordinary high school student Emiya Shirou's life takes an extraordinary turn. Orphaned twice and adopted by a magus, Shirou's limited knowledge of magecraft and dreams of heroism are put to the test when he stumbles upon a battle between powerful Servants, Archer and Lancer. Mortally wounded and left to die, Shirou's fate changes when he inadvertently summons a heroic Servant of his own, Saber.\n\nNow, as one of seven Masters participating in the covert Holy Grail War, Shirou must navigate a treacherous world of magic and deceit, where the true identities of Servants hold the key to victory or defeat. With the enigmatic school idol, Toosaka Rin, as a rival and classmates turned enemies, Shirou's unwavering sense of justice will be tested as he fights for the ultimate prize: a single wish granted by the Holy Grail.\n\nThis reimagining of the original 24-episode anime, Fate Stay Night, brings the intense battles and dramatic story to life in an OVA format, as Shirou and Saber face off against powerful foes in a war where only the strongest will survive.",
