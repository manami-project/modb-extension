    "text": "After an unfortunate accident, an ordinary man finds himself reincarnated as Loneal, a minor character in a popular fantasy romance novel titled \"The Silver Prince and the Holy Bride.\" The novel centers around the love story between the handsome Prince Alec and Lady Lily, the heroine. Seeking to avoid interfering with the predetermined plot, Loneal tries to steer clear of the dashing Prince. However, to his surprise, Alec becomes utterly enthralled by Loneal instead of Lily. Captivated by Loneal's charm and good looks, the Prince ardently proclaims his affections, much to Loneal's bewilderment. As Alec relentlessly pursues him, a flustered Loneal struggles to resist the Prince's advances. Yet despite Loneal's efforts to avoid disrupting the storyline, he finds himself falling for Alec. Ultimately, in an unexpected twist of fate, it is Loneal and not Lady Lily who ends up in the Prince's passionate embrace. Confused but entranced, Loneal grapples to make sense of this new reality in which the perfect prince has chosen him over the destined holy bride. One thing is clear - events have diverged drastically from the novel's original tale.",
