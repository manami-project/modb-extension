    "text": "Densuke Matsuo's radio station is struggling to stay afloat in the competitive world of 2010. In a desperate bid to boost their dismal ratings, the station hires Maico, an android with a charming persona, as their new on-air host. Maico is a technological marvel who never needs to rest, eat, or take breaks, making her the perfect candidate to captivate listeners around the clock. However, the station's ragtag team of unsuccessful employees, each with their own quirks and agendas, may prove to be a greater challenge than Maico's programming had anticipated. As they navigate the chaotic world of radio broadcasting, Maico and her colleagues must fend off obsessive fans, lovestruck coworkers, and even deranged assassins. Can this unlikely team of misfits and their android companion save the station from its impending doom, or will their antics lead to even greater disaster? Only time will tell in this thrilling and unpredictable adventure.",
