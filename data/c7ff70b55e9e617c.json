  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2010, the Japanese radio industry is struggling to stay relevant amidst declining listenership. Desperate for a breakthrough, one failing Tokyo station makes a bold gamble - hiring Maico, the world's first android radio host. Though cute and tireless, Maico faces a steep challenge in turning around the fortunes of this motley crew of has-beens and never-weres. Between the arrogant yet washed-up director, the quirky technical staff harboring hopeless crushes, and the hack writer who only finds inspiration in others' failures, dysfunction reigns supreme behind the scenes. Still, with ratings plummeting and corporate executives demanding results, the team has no choice but to rally behind their synthetic star. As they prepare to launch their variety program \"Jump Out Maico 2010,\" Maico has much to learn about human nature while her human colleagues have much to learn about redeeming themselves. Through the laughter and chaos, each may discover their higher purpose lies not in the spotlight but in lifting each other up.",
