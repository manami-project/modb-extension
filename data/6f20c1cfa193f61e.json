    "text": "Akira is a kind-hearted high school student who faces frequent bullying from his classmates. His childhood friend Ryo suddenly returns to his life and reveals to Akira an impending war between demons and humanity. In order to fight the demons, Ryo persuades a reluctant Akira to undergo a dangerous ritual to fuse with the powerful demon Amon. Though apprehensive, Akira agrees in order to protect mankind, becoming the mighty half-demon half-human hybrid known as Devilman. With only Ryo as his ally, Akira must now harness his newfound demonic abilities to defeat the bloodthirsty demons that are awakening from their ancient slumber deep underground. As the fate of the world rests on Devilman's shoulders, Akira struggles internally with his human empathy conflicting against the vicious demon within.",
