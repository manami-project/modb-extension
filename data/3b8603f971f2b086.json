    "text": "Honda is a living skeleton who works at a bookstore managing the manga section. Though Honda aims to run the store smoothly, their job proves more chaotic than one might expect. Procuring out-of-print books and tracking down missing bonus items poses logistical challenges. Meanwhile, passionate manga fans flood the store with tricky requests. Still, Honda perseveres through these daily trials with dedication to their work and care for their customers. Alongside eccentric coworkers, they take pride in providing quality service and hard-to-find reads. Comedic mishaps ensue as Honda wrangles unruly book shipments and attends to enthusiastic otaku. But the skeleton remains unflappable, driven by their love of manga and desire to spread that passion. Though the life of a manga bookseller has its frustrations, Honda cherishes the laughs and connections made at the counter. Join this oddball employee on their quest to run a smooth shop and spread the joy of reading, one book at a time.",
