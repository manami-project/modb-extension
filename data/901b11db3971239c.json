  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Security and peace in a futuristic Tokyo are under constant threat as the city grapples with the aftermath of the Third Quicksand Disaster and the Space Elevator Project. To combat the escalating crimes involving high-output, reinforced exoskeletons called Willwears, the National Police Agency establishes Unit 8, a specialized team within the 5th Special Public Security Section's 3rd Mobile Assault Division.\n\nAfter successfully thwarting the terrorist organization Logos, the rash and careless Unit 8, also known as \"The Eighth,\" gains nationwide popularity. However, the misuse of Willwear technology continues to rise, forcing the team to adapt and grow. With new members joining their ranks and the support of civilian police, Kuroki and the rest of Unit 8 face new challenges in their ongoing battle against crime.\n\nUtilizing their Willwear exoskeletons, brains, bravery, and the gift of gab, the team fights to maintain order in a city on the brink. As the stakes grow higher and the threats become more dangerous, Takeru, Souichirou, and their friends must work together to protect the citizens of Tokyo from the escalating Willwear-related crimes.",
