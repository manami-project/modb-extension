  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's a delightful day in the life of the majestic Pokémon, Slowking, as he embarks on his daily adventures on the tranquil Shamouti Island. This charming short special, akin to the mini-movies accompanying Pokémon theatrical releases, is uniquely narrated in the Pokémon language. With a fondness for coconuts, leisurely strolls, rejuvenating afternoon naps, and the breathtaking beauty of sunsets, Slowking is set to enjoy all his favorite activities throughout the day. Originally released only in Japan and Greece due to its brief runtime, this endearing tale has also been officially dubbed in Russian for fans to enjoy.",
