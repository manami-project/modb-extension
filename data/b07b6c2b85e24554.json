  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Poor Harima is still tangled in his quest to confess his feelings to Tenma, but he's got some stiff competition - himself! Despite his heroic efforts, from mammoth hunting to strategizing for the perfect classroom seat, he can't seem to shake off the misconception of a potential romance between Yakumo and himself. Meanwhile, Yakumo, always admired but never truly close to anyone, finds herself in an unexpected friendship with Sarah, an exchange student. But that's not all; a ghost girl has also taken an interest in Yakumo, eager to hear her thoughts on the opposite sex. Amidst all this, the usual chaos of School Rumble continues, filled with hilarious misunderstandings, unexpected alliances, and a dash of prehistoric adventure. This two-part OVA is a delightful mix of new and familiar faces, offering a fresh perspective on the beloved series.",
