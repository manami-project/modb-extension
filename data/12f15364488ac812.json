    "text": "OVAs\"Tsubasa TOKYO REVELATIONS\" by Production I.G and Nanase/Ageha Ohkawa (CLAMP's scriptwriter) take Syaoran, Sakura, Fye, Kurogane, and Mokona to a war-torn Tokyo, following their departure from Record Country. The city is ravaged by acid rain and conflict over scarce resources, creating a tense atmosphere. As the group reluctantly becomes entangled in the struggle for survival, they encounter a hooded faction and uncover shocking truths that alter their journey. Amidst betrayal and life-threatening battles, they must navigate the desolate landscape and confront their most formidable enemy yet. The Tokyo arc, which follows episode 42, sees the group's quest for Sakura's remaining feathers take a dramatic turn as they face Fei Wong Reed's true intentions and the awakening of another Shaolan. These revelations will forever change their lives.",
