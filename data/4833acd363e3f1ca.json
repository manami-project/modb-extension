  "synopsis": {
    "text": "St. President School is one of the most prestigious and wealthy schools around. The most popular and influential group at the school is the Yukan Club. Its members come from extremely affluent backgrounds and include Shouchikubai Miroku, the son of a hospital owner; Kenbishi Yuuri, the daughter of a famous painter; Kikumasamune Seishirou, the son of a Swedish diplomat; Hakushika Noriko; and Kizakura Karen. United by their privileged lifestyles and thirst for adventure, the Yukan Club often gets embroiled in daring exploits, usually centered around St. President School itself. These thrilling adventures have included searching for a missing cat on campus, embarking on eventful trips to Hong Kong, and even saving the school from calamity. While the Yukan Club members relish the excitement, their escapades also serve to stave off boredom in their lavish lives. With wealth, power and limitless resources at their disposal, the Yukan Club turns St. President School into their personal playground.",
