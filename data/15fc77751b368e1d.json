    "text": "Mii-kun, a tiny, adorable mummy, unexpectedly enters the mundane life of high school student Sora Kashiwagi. The peculiar gift, sent by his globe-trotting, adventure-seeking father from Egypt, comes with a letter casually mentioning the discovery of a \"cool mummy\" that Sora must now care for. Initially hesitant, Sora warms up to the palm-sized, shy, and tearful creature, naming it Mii-kun and deciding to take on the responsibility of its care.\n\nAs Sora navigates the challenges of raising a delicate, ancient being, he encounters other students with their own extraordinary pets, creating a diverse and amusing cast of characters. Balancing school life and the unique demands of Mii-kun's care, Sora forms a heartwarming bond with his new companion. Despite the occasional hardships, Sora finds joy and friendship in this unexpected adventure, proving that even the most peculiar gifts can bring happiness.",
