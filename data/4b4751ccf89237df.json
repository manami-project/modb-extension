  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nodoka and Yue, two magic enthusiasts, stumble upon an intriguing spell in their practice sessions: The Red String of Fate, a spell that allegedly connects one to their destined partner. However, when Nodoka decides to give it a shot, she finds herself magically tethered to Negi, her teacher, by an unbreakable red string. Disappointingly, this isn't the mystical Red String of Fate, but merely a spell that binds two individuals together.\n\nAs they navigate this unexpected situation, Ayaka extends an invitation to the entire class for a complimentary trip to her family's newly built spa resort. With Negi and Nodoka literally tied together for the day, they must figure out how to make the best of this free vacation without overstepping any boundaries.\n\nDespite the initial excitement, the reality of their predicament sets in as they attempt to perform mundane tasks, like taking a bath, while being physically connected. Will this unforeseen circumstance bring them closer, or will it prove to be an awkward hurdle they must overcome? Only time will tell in this enchanting tale of magic, friendship, and unexpected connections.",
