Together, they embark on a journey to compete in the Jewel Star Grand Prix, a magical tournament where the winners are granted any wish they desire. Despite Ruby's occasional magical mishaps, the duo remains hopeful, determined to triumph against all odds. Will they emerge victorious, or will their magical adventure culminate in chaos? Only time will tell.",
