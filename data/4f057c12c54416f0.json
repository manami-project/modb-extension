    "text": "Japanese culture and cyberpunk aesthetics collide in the captivating anime short, URVAN, a collaboration between Toei Animation and Nagasaki International University. Drawing inspiration from the ancient Avestan word 'urvan' (spirit) and the Japanese custom of Obon, this anime presents a mystical and nostalgic cyberpunk action tale set in the bustling Sasebo City, Nagasaki Prefecture.\n\nThe story follows the thrilling journey of an enigmatic girl and man as they navigate through a cyberpunk-infused Sasebo landscape. As the girl explores a school and gathers otherworldly lanterns, she is relentlessly pursued by a menacing figure. Meanwhile, the real-life scenery of Sasebo transforms into a cybernetic dreamscape, where the ordinary and extraordinary coalesce in a dazzling spectacle.\n\nURVAN pushes the boundaries of animation production during the coronavirus pandemic by using remote location scouting and advanced communication tools. The result is a visually stunning work that captures the essence of Sasebo City without physically being there. Local specialty products are also showcased throughout the anime, adding a unique and immersive touch for viewers familiar with the area.\n\nPrepare for a thrilling ride as the lines between reality and fantasy blur in this innovative cyberpunk adventure, where spirits and technology converge to create an unforgettable experience.",
