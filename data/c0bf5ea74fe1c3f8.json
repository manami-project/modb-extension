  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story is set in a world where humanity has nearly eradicated witches through the use of advanced weaponry like firearms. To deal with the remaining magical threats, an Anti-Magic Academy was established to train special warriors called Inquisitors. The focus is on the 35th Test Platoon, the lowest-ranked squad at the Academy, nicknamed \"Small Fry Platoon\" due to the incompetence of its members. Their captain is Takeru Kusanagi, who lacks any talent with firearms and can only fight with swords. Things change when Ouka Ootori, an elite pistol master, joins their platoon as punishment after she broke rules by killing a witch. Her arrival causes clashes within the group due to her hatred of witches and tendency to act outside the rules. Despite their differences, this eclectic group must learn to work together as a team in order to improve their rank and succeed as Inquisitors. Their journey forces them to overcome their weaknesses, tragic pasts, and ethical disagreements about the proper way to deal with magical threats.",
