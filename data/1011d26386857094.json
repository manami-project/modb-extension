  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kowloon Children, a formidable enemy that once set the world ablaze, are back after a decade of peace between humans and vampires. The Special Zone, a sanctuary where both species coexist, is now under threat as the Kowloon Children seek entry, invited by an unknown entity. Mochizuki Jirou, famously known as the Silver Blade, is a legendary warrior who had once defeated these creatures, albeit at a significant personal loss. As he returns to Japan with his younger brother, Kotarou, they find themselves entangled in a new conflict involving human soldiers, vampire refugees, and the resurgent Kowloon Children. When Kotarou is kidnapped, Jirou must wield his Silver Blade once more, aided by Mimiko Katsuragi, a human-vampire mediator. As an Old Blood, the last of an elite vampire lineage, Jirou stands as the only hope to restore peace in the Special Zone and protect those he cherishes. Witness the unfolding of a bloody tale of survival and power, where alliances are tested, and the line between friend and foe blurs.",
