Pretending to be newlyweds, their cover is nearly blown when the criminals suspect something is amiss after hearing no nightly sounds from the \"couple's\" room. To convince them, Riko and Noma start becoming intimate, touching each other and making noises loud enough to be overheard. Though initially undertaken just as part of their act, Riko soon begins finding pleasure in her partner's touch, blurring the lines between duty and desire.
