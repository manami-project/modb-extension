    "text": "In the streets of Musashino, Tokyo, a disturbing phenomenon is unfolding. A young boy wearing golden roller skates and wielding a matching golden baseball bat has begun carrying out seemingly random assaults on both children and adults alike. Dubbed \"Shounen Bat\" by the media, this mysterious assailant eludes capture and strikes fear into the hearts of Musashino's residents. As paranioa and anxiety spread, detectives Keiichi Ikari and Mitsuhiro Maniwa take on the case to uncover Shounen Bat's identity and motives. However, the investigation proves far more complex than anticipated. Each victim offers perplexing clues about their unsettling yet cathartic encounters with the notorious Shounen Bat. Many hide shocking secrets or live double lives. As the detectives delve deeper into the psyche of Musashino's inhabitants, the line between predator and prey blurs. Truth collides with madness until the only certainty is that still more victims will fall prey to the golden bat.",
