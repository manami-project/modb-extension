    "text": "Guided by a divine encounter, Tenkorin Okakura, a high school student with a penchant for slacking, embarks on an unexpected journey to become a skilled painter. In a dream, she meets Raijin, the god of painters, and expresses her desire for her dreams to manifest without effort. Instead of granting her wish outright, Raijin summons historical artists from different eras to guide her on the path to mastery. As Tenkorin learns from these artistic legends, she discovers the value of hard work and determination, ultimately striving to create a promising future as a genuine artist.",
