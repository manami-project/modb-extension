  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2050, the effects of global warming have left much of Japan underwater, crippling its economy. In response, the Japanese government formed JESAS, a military organization tasked with dumping nuclear waste into space. However, this waste is now colliding and poisoning the planet. JESAS has also developed advanced robotic weapons controlled by pilots with Accurate Intuition (A.I.) to protect Japan from other countries. Opposing JESAS is the Green Frontier, a united protection agency formed by countries to save the Earth. When JESAS begins trying to take control of Japan, it sparks an open war with Green Frontier. The fate of Earth now lies in the hands of four young pilots - JESAS's Kanna and Kazuto who fight to secure Japan's future, and Green Frontier's Doota Kang and Mira Yu who fight to protect the planet. These rivals will decide the planet's destiny through their sense of duty, bonds of friendship, and passion for their cause.",
