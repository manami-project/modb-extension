  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shop ping for a laugh riot? Look no further than the world of Oshiri Kajiri Mushi XVIII, the 10-year-old insect protagonist of this hilarious gag comedy! As the heir to his family's unique Biting Shop business, Oshiri is no ordinary bug. With a passion for singing and dancing that outshines even the brightest stage lights, he attends Biting School to hone his craft.\n\nBut what exactly is this craft, you ask? Well, when Oshiri bites someone on their bottom, the results are nothing short of miraculous! Hunched backs are straightened, depression lifts, and self-confidence soars. It's a complete transformation that leaves people feeling like brand new versions of themselves.\n\nHowever, even a pro like Oshiri is prone to the occasional slip-up. After all, being a Bottom Biting Bug isn't as easy as it sounds! Through a series of typical yet side-splitting everyday scenarios, this story unfolds with the kind of humor that kids (and let's be honest, adults too) absolutely love.\n\nSo, buckle up for a wild ride filled with laughter, joy, and the occasional bite on the bottom! This is one anime that promises to leave you in stitches while warming your heart.",
