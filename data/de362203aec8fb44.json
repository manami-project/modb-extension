  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuko, Nagi, and Run, three friends with distinct personalities, welcome a new addition to their high school circle: Tooru, an energetic, sweets-loving girl with a protective streak. Tooru, who has finally been accepted into the same school as her childhood friend Run, is overjoyed at the prospect of spending more time together. However, Run's air-headed and sleepy demeanor often leads to misunderstandings, especially when Tooru finds her in a compromising position with Yuuko.\n\nTooru's diminutive size and younger age belie her fierce determination to safeguard her friendship with Run, even resorting to brandishing an aluminum baseball bat at perceived threats. This often puts Yuuko, a tall and timid girl, in the line of fire as Tooru sees her as a rival for Run's affection. Meanwhile, Nagi, the level-headed glasses-wearing friend, tries to navigate the complex dynamics of their group.\n\nAs they journey through their daily lives, the four friends face a myriad of mundane situations, both in and out of school. Despite the occasional misunderstandings and jealous outbursts, they always find a way to pull through, making each day a unique and memorable experience.",
