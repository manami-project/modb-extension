  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a quaint coastal town, a school principal, fondly admired by his lively students, finds himself lost in a nostalgic reverie. Gazing at a childhood drawing of a whale, he is transported back to a time when his school overlooked a sea brimming with these magnificent creatures. As a boy, he had watched these giants from his classroom window, oblivious to their true worth, viewing them merely as a source of sustenance.\n\nNow, as the headmaster, he finds himself yearning to repay these creatures for their unwitting contribution to his past. His heart aches as he paints a whale, a sight he once took for granted but now seldom sees. Suddenly, he spots a whale stranded on the rocky shore, a rare sight that stirs him into action. He rushes from the school, driven by a newfound respect and an urgent desire to aid the beached creature.",
