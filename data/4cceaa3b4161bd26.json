    "text": "Episode Ardyn of Final Fantasy XV unveils the tale of Ardyn Izunia, the primary antagonist in the game. This narrative delves into the chronicles of his tribulations, demise, and rebirth, setting the stage for the main plot of FFXV. The animation transports viewers back two millennia, shedding light on the events of that era.\n\nIn a realm where deities coexist with humanity, the world of Eos descends into darkness. A catastrophe strikes mankind as sinister beings, known as 'daemons', ravage the land with their seemingly invincible strength. Amidst this chaos, the nobles of House Caelum ascend, gaining the people's faith and loyalty due to their divine healing abilities, which can cleanse the pestilence carried by the daemons.\n\nWith the absence of a ruler for the first human kingdom, the gods seek a suitable candidate to fill this void. A man from the Caelum lineage appears to be an ideal choice. The competition for the throne intensifies as Somnus Lucis Caelum, a pragmatic and ambitious contender, faces off against his selfless and benevolent brother, Ardyn Lucis Caelum. The destiny of the world hangs in the balance, hinging on the decisive triumph of one of these brothers.",
