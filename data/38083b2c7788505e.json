    "text": "His dream of becoming a hero has always fueled Kirill Vrubel's aspirations, and his chance to make it a reality comes in the most unexpected way in the city-state of Lisvalletta. This unique city, bathed in the light of two suns, is plagued by the rise of a dangerous drug called Anthem. This lethal substance transforms its users into powerful creatures with extraordinary abilities, casting a dark shadow over the once peaceful city.\n\nTo combat this new threat, the special crime investigation unit SEVEN-O is formed, employing a unique 'Double Decker System' that pairs agents together to tackle the menace. Enter Doug Billingham, a seasoned investigator in need of a new partner, and Kirill, whose mysterious abilities are yet to be discovered.\n\nAfter a chance encounter with an Anthem user during a hostage situation, Kirill finds himself joining forces with Doug, earning a spot within SEVEN-O. As they work together to protect Lisvalletta from the escalating crime and the dangerous effects of Anthem, Kirill may just find the hero within himself.\n\nTheir journey begins in the first episode, which premiered online on September 3, 2018, with the TV broadcast commencing on September 30, 2018.",
