  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Phantoms, once dismissed as mere superstition, have been unveiled as supernatural entities coexisting with humans due to a brain-altering virus that has reshaped society's perception of reality. This virus has also bestowed unique abilities upon the younger generation, enabling them to combat dangerous phantoms. Among these gifted individuals are Haruhiko Ichijou and Mai Kawakami, high school students at Hosea Academy. Haruhiko possesses the power to summon and seal phantoms through his artwork, while Mai incorporates elemental forces into her martial arts. Alongside a benevolent phantom named Ruru, they establish Team E, a group dedicated to managing the mischievous antics of phantoms. As they navigate their everyday high school lives, they confront the extraordinary challenges of a world where the real and the fantastical collide. Join Haruhiko, Mai, and their friends as they unravel the mysteries of the Phantom World.",
