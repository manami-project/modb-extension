  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shiromitsugawa is a quiet college town struggling to attract tourism, even sponsoring a poorly-received anime about local folklore. But when the sacred relic at the local shrine shatters mysteriously, ordinary life is thrown into chaos. Several young residents suddenly develop superhuman abilities from the relic's artifacts. Protagonist Kakeru Niimi, though sometimes curt, has a strong sense of responsibility and kind heart. Along with the heroine he grows to trust and care for, Kakeru finds himself hunting a supernatural serial killer behind a string of odd murders around town. What was once an average small town is now home to extraordinary powers, budding relationships, and a dangerous mystery threatening the lives of its newest superpowered citizens. They must work together to uncover the culprit's identity before the body count rises.",
