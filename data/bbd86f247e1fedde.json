    "text": "Meanwhile in 1945, after the successful defense of Gallia and Romagna against the otherworldly Neuroi, the Strike Witches are disbanded, and Yoshika Miyafuji, one of its members, returns to her homeland of Fusou to pursue a career in medicine. Having lost her magical abilities during the battle for Romagna, Yoshika is determined to help others in any way she can. When Fusou Naval Cadet Shizuka Hattori offers her the opportunity to study abroad in Europe, Yoshika eagerly accepts, unaware that the Neuroi are once again on the move. As the Neuroi grow more powerful and threaten to break through human defense lines, the Strike Witches must reform to face this new challenge. But with Yoshika's magical abilities gone, will she be able to contribute to the fight against the Neuroi? Only time will tell as Yoshika embarks on a new journey to Europe, leaving behind her family clinic and the life she knew.",
