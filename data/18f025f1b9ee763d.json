    "text": "High school is tough, but for Wang Ling, it's a whole new level of challenge. Since the tender age of one, Wang Ling has been gifted with extraordinary abilities that he struggles to control, making him nearly invincible. Now at 16, all he yearns for is a normal high school experience, but fate seems to have other plans.\n\nAs a cultivation prodigy who has reached new realms every two years, Wang Ling's power is far beyond his control. Despite his cool and carefree exterior, he harbors a volatile force within him that could potentially destroy the world. To keep this force in check, his parents have relied on an amulet as a temporary fix. However, with the amulet weakening over time and Wang Ling's emotions accelerating its decay, the duo is in a race against time to repair it.\n\nWith each new challenge threatening to disrupt his plans for a low-key high school life, Wang Ling finds himself further from his dream of normality. Will he be able to navigate the trials of senior high school while keeping his extraordinary abilities under control, or will his powers overwhelm him and shatter his dreams of an ordinary life? Join Wang Ling on his thrilling journey to find out!",
