    "text": "In the heart of the Toukai region, a young boy named Wada embarks on a new journey as he transfers to a local middle school. Inspired by the Chunichi Dragons baseball team, Wada and his eclectic group of friends - Morino, Araki, Blanco, and Ibata - share their everyday adventures, forming an unbreakable bond in this slice-of-life anime.\n\nAs night descends upon the city, a group of magical warriors emerges to protect its citizens. Ai, Rin, and Meg join forces to combat the malevolent yuragi plaguing the streets. Once solitary creatures, these yuragi now unite for an unknown purpose. At the epicenter of this battle is Shin and his daughter Mayu, born from a tragic encounter between Shin and Rin.",
