    "text": "Hero es of yore once defended the world against the destructive forces that sought to annihilate it. Their heroic deeds became the stuff of legends, and their powers were passed down to a new generation of protectors known as Successors. Among these Successors, an elite group called the Seven Knights stands at the forefront of the battle against the resurging forces of Destruction. When Faria, a member of the Seven Knights, saves a young boy named Nemo from the enemy's clutches, she inadvertently triggers the awakening of his dormant powers. Nemo, it turns out, is a Successor to a Hero shrouded in mystery, one who has been lost to the annals of history. As the past and present converge, Nemo and Faria embark on an epic journey to uncover the truth about this enigmatic Hero and protect the world from the looming threat of Destruction.",
