    "text": "Long ago, valiant heroes banded together to fight and defeat the evil forces of Destruction that threatened the world. These legendary warriors became known as the Seven Knights. Over time, their deeds passed into myth and legend. Generations later, the descendants of the Seven Knights, known as \"Successors,\" inherit a portion of their ancestor's powers. The Successors carry on the duty of protecting the world from harm. Faria, one of the current Seven Knights Successors, rescues an ordinary boy named Nemo from an attack. During the battle, Nemo suddenly manifests the long-dormant power of a legendary hero. Though this is a joyous occasion, no one recognizes which forgotten hero Nemo is descended from. As Nemo joins Faria and the other Successors, mysteries from the past begin to collide with the present. Who was Nemo's ancestral hero that history forgot? And what new evil threatens the peace they have long defended? The time has come for the Successors to unlock the secrets of the past in order to save the future!",
