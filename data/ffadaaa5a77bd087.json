  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Bundled in this anime is the story of Konoe Moyako and her younger brother, Akira. As children, Akira made an innocent declaration of wanting to marry Moyako, which she misconstrued as a sign of his perverted obsession with her. Now in their teenage years, Moyako takes it upon herself to \"rehabilitate\" her brother, interpreting every interaction through her skewed perspective. However, the perversion seems to exist solely in Moyako's imagination, as she continually twists harmless situations into creepy scenarios. As she stumbles through her self-appointed task, one can't help but wonder: is Akira truly the one in need of rehabilitation, or is Moyako simply projecting her own warped thoughts onto her unsuspecting brother? Join this hilarious duo as they navigate the complexities of sibling relationships and the power of perception.",
