  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Konoe Moyako was young, her little brother Akira innocently declared that he wanted to marry her someday. Moyako misinterpreted this as a sign that Akira had an inappropriate obsession with her. Now a teenager, Moyako remains convinced that she must \"rehabilitate\" her brother from what she perceives as a sister complex. However, Akira's behavior and intentions seem entirely normal. In reality, Moyako is the one turning harmless interactions into strange situations in her own mind. Though aiming to discourage perversion, Moyako's overactive imagination instead results in her embarrassingly misconstruing circumstances. This lighthearted comedy anime explores the humor and complications arising from innocent childhood promises and the assumptions we make about others.",
