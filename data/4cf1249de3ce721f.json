    "text": "Police the galaxy and earn a quick buck? That's just another day in the life of A-ko and B-ko, a dynamic duo of bounty hunters patrolling a sandy, alternate universe. Their latest target: colossal tortoises roaming the desert landscape. But when a wealthy heiress, C-ko, plummets from the heavens and into their lives, the pair's routine is flipped upside down.\n\nThe kidnapping of C-ko by a ruthless band of space pirates, led by the enigmatic Gail, sets the stage for a daring rescue mission. A-ko and B-ko, enticed by the hefty reward, team up with Maruten, a diminutive Galactic Police Officer, to save C-ko. Little do they know, their mission is entangled in a sinister plot that threatens the very fabric of the universe.\n\nGail's true intentions involve using C-ko's body as a vessel for Xena, a long-deceased sorceress with a thirst for destruction. As A-ko and B-ko navigate through a perilous cosmic battlefield, they must rely on their unique strengths and inventions to outwit their adversaries and foil Gail's nefarious scheme. Can they save C-ko and the universe in time, or will they become the next victims of this intergalactic power struggle?",
