  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's Hamtaro's birthday, and his owner Laura decides to share some of his backstory. She shows Hamtaro photos of when he was a baby hamster with his mother, Yuki. This sparks Hamtaro's curiosity about his origins and mother, whom he hasn't seen since he was a baby. Eager to reconnect with Yuki, Hamtaro sets out on a journey with his friends Boss and Oxnard. Yuki lives far away in the town of Sumire, so reaching her will require traversing urban landscapes and fields of vibrant sunflowers. With Hamtaro only eight centimeters tall, it's no small feat! While Hamtaro travels to find his mother, his other Ham-Ham friends stay behind, busily preparing a surprise birthday party for when he returns. They excitedly send out invitations for the big celebration on August 6th. Will Hamtaro reunite with Yuki and make it back in time for the party? His birthday quest is filled with warmth, friendship, and the promise of discovery.",
