  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuusuke Yotsuya is a logical and aloof middle school student who finds himself suddenly transported to a dangerous fantasy world along with his classmates Iu Shindou and Kusue Hakozaki. An enigmatic Game Master informs them that they must embark on perilous quests and missions in this mystical land riddled with mythological creatures. While Shindou and Hakozaki are granted magical powers to aid them, Yotsuya is randomly assigned the lackluster role of a farmer. However, with his detached personality and cunning intellect, he contributes to the group in his own unique way. Together, the trio must defeat menacing monsters, decipher complex puzzles, and overcome scheming enemies in order to complete each phase of the game within the time limit. Failure to do so would not only endanger their own lives, but allow the demonic forces of this realm to spill into the real world. Although Yotsuya approaches everything with cold logic and calculation, he learns the value of teamwork and forging bonds as their adventure progresses. Will the three students succeed in conquering the Game Master's challenges? Or will their differences divide them in the face of unimaginable threats?",
