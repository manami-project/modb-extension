    "text": "As the 21st century commenced, a devastating interplanetary war left Earth's ecosystem in ruins, forcing humanity to seek refuge on distant planets. In this new era, music and entertainment are deemed threats to societal order and are strictly forbidden by the iron-fisted Deep Galactic Trade Organization. However, a daring group of young women defy these oppressive laws, reincarnating the legendary J-Pop band AKB48 as the interstellar idols AKB0048. Combining their musical talents with combat training, these audacious performers embark on a mission to rekindle the spirit of music throughout the galaxy. Traversing from one planet to another, they stage guerrilla concerts and risk arrest to bring joy to their fans. As new recruits join their ranks, they must master their skills and embrace their roles in this illicit ensemble, becoming the beacon of hope and harmony in a universe that has outlawed both. Witness the thrilling journey of AKB0048 as they strive to save the cosmos with the power of music.",
