  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Five years ago, a series of disturbing murders shocked a Japanese city to its core. Recently, strange events have again begun occurring, including mysterious disappearances, deaths, and unexplained phenomena. Rumors persist that an entity named Boogiepop may be behind the odd happenings. Some believe Boogiepop is an angel of death who takes victims, while others question Boogiepop's very existence. High school students seem most affected, with some exhibiting strange new abilities and others chasing ghosts or losing touch with reality. A student named Nagi Kirima takes particular interest in investigating the connections between the events. She appears to know more about what's happening than most. With more questions than answers, an aura of fear and uncertainty hangs over the city. Is Boogiepop truly the culprit or is there a more sinister force at work? As darkness takes on many forms, no one feels safe from the threat that lurks unseen. The truth may contain elements far more dangerous than anyone imagined.",
