    "text": "Ikki Itsuki is the leader of a youth gang called East Side Gunz, who goes by the nickname \"Unbeatable Babyface.\" After being humiliated in a fight with a rival gang called the Skull Saders, Ikki returns home and discovers that his benefactors, the Noyamano sisters, are part of a secret group of Storm Riders called Sleeping Forest. They give Ikki a pair of Air Trecks, futuristic motorized rollerblades, to help restore his confidence. Ikki uses the Air Trecks to get revenge on the Skull Saders, and in the process he becomes enthralled with the sensation of flight from riding Air Trecks. Some time later, after Ikki receives an offer from Simca to lead the Storm Rider team Genesis, his gang Kogarasumaru ends up in a turf dispute with another team called Potemkin. This octuplet group of brothers, known for their ruthless attitude towards money, sees Kogarasumaru as easy targets. Kazu and Ikki eagerly take up their challenge, which takes place on a treacherous circuit of boats. With the Potemkin brothers' experience to their advantage, Kazu and Ikki face tough odds, but their skill and determination could lead them to victory.",
