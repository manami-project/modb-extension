    "text": "Minami Ikki, a once humiliated delinquent known as the \"Unbeatable Babyface,\" finds himself leading the East Side Gunz and later becoming the new head of Genesis after accepting Simca's offer. This episode, set between the 21st and 22nd episodes of the main series, showcases the intense battle between Kogarasumaru and Potemkine.\n\nAfter a devastating encounter with the Skull Saders, Ikki's life takes a drastic turn when the Noyamano sisters, members of the Sleeping Forest Storm Riders, reveal a secret to him. Equipped with a pair of Air Trecks (ATs), Ikki not only settles his score with the Skull Saders but also develops a newfound passion for the thrilling world of Air Treck.\n\nAs the new leader of Genesis, Ikki faces a formidable challenge from team Potemkin's octuplets, who are determined to exploit his inexperience. The battlefield: a treacherous circuit of hurdles atop unstable, drifting boats. With Kazu by his side, Ikki must rely on his skills and luck to triumph over the maritime-experienced brothers. Will their determination and grit be enough, or will the brothers' expertise prove to be an insurmountable advantage?",
