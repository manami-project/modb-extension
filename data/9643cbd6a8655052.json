    "text": "When Yuuko's time in the world of the living reaches its end, she leaves behind a solemn promise from her loyal friend, Kimihiro Watanuki, to keep the wish-granting shop running until they reunite. A decade later, Watanuki has taken over the shop, accompanied by Maru, Moro, and Mokona, and occasionally visited by old acquaintances like Shizuka Doumeki and Kohane Tsuyuri. As Doumeki and Tsuyuri delve deeper into folklore studies, they stumble upon a mysterious case that piques Watanuki's interest. Meanwhile, Doumeki's grandfather, Haruka, seeks Watanuki's help to explore his grandson's dreams, revealing hidden truths and secrets about their enduring friendship. One day, Doumeki, now a professor, approaches Watanuki with a peculiar request from a young girl who has been acting strangely since her grandmother's passing, prompting Watanuki to investigate and help restore her to her former self.",
