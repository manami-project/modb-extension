  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ash Ketchum travels to the Alola region for a vacation with his mother Delia, but decides to stay and enroll in the Pokémon School after seeing it. He adventures across Alola with his trusty partner Pikachu and new classmates like Lillie, Kiawe, Lana, Mallow, and Sophocles. RotomDex, a special Pokédex inhabited by the Pokémon Rotom, joins Ash's team and provides helpful information. Ash aims to master Z-Moves - powerful attacks requiring a Z-Ring - after receiving one from the guardian deity Tapu Koko. Meanwhile, his frequent foes Team Rocket have come to Alola hoping to steal rare Pokémon, and the thuggish Team Skull cause trouble with possibly sinister intentions. With new Pokémon to discover, an Island Challenge to take on, and Z-Moves to learn, Ash heads into an exciting new chapter pursuing his goal of becoming a Pokémon Master. Between classes at the Pokémon School and encounters with guardian deities, this tropical region has plenty of adventure in store for Ash and Pikachu!",
