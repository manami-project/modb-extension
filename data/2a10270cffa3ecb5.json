    "text": "Despite being dispatched on a mission to annihilate Earth while traveling on Halley's Comet, an extraterrestrial agent finds themselves unable to carry out the task upon witnessing the planet's breathtaking beauty. Seventy-six years later, another agent from Halley's Comet is sent to Earth with orders to eliminate the traitor who has now assumed the form of a young Vietnamese girl named Lamina. This captivating anime, the first original animated video produced by Tezuka Productions, follows Lamina's story as she navigates life on the very planet she was meant to destroy, all while being hunted by her former comrades. Tezuka Osamu's oversight of the original story adds depth and intrigue to this thrilling tale of intergalactic consequences.",
