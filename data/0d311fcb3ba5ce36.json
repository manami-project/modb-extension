    "text": "Although the tranquil mining town of Garden Indigo, nestled on the planet Gift, is best known for its coveted blue crystals called Giftium, Sougo Amagi's life takes a dramatic turn when he stumbles upon something far more extraordinary. As a devoted collector of these rare crystals, Sougo's curiosity leads him deep into the abandoned mine shafts, where a heated argument with his classmates Kaon, Roman, and Otto causes him to plummet into the depths below.\n\nUpon regaining consciousness, Sougo discovers an enigmatic blue-haired girl named Felia with striking red eyes, hidden within the subterranean caverns. Despite her mysterious origins, the two quickly forge a bond, but their newfound friendship is soon threatened by a clandestine organization intent on exploiting Felia's rumored special powers.\n\nNow, as Sougo and his friends find themselves entangled in a dangerous web of secrets and pursuits, they must protect Felia and unravel the truth behind her connection to the legendary red crystal, Lucifer. In doing so, they may just uncover the key to unlocking Sougo's mother's unrealized research and the hidden wonders of the world Gift.",
