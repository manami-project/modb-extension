    "text": "On the planet Zi, human pilots battle using giant bio-mechanical beasts called Zoids. In an abandoned facility, a boy named Van discovers a special type of Zoid called an Organoid, naming it Zeke. Zeke has the ability to revive and enhance other Zoids. When Zeke brings an old Shield Liger back to life, Van uses it to fend off pursuing bandits. Van later finds a mysterious girl named Fiona emerging from a pod in the facility. Suffering from amnesia, Fiona only recalls a vague mission to locate the \"Zoid Eve.\" Wanting to uncover her origins, she joins Van and Zeke on a quest across Zi, meeting friends and enemies alike. They become embroiled in the war consuming the planet, while piecing together Fiona's past and seeking the truth about Zoid Eve. Their adventure is filled with danger and excitement as they pilot incredible Zoids in combat, pursue the mystery of Fiona's destiny, and attempt to stop the planetary war.",
