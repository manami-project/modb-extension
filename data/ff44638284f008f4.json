    "text": "Freiheit Van stumbles upon an abandoned facility in the desolate desert of Planet Zi, where he encounters an extraordinary creature known as an Organoid, a living entity capable of enhancing mechanical beasts called Zoids. Van names the Organoid Zeke and forms a bond with it, leading to the revival of an old Zoid, the Shield Liger. When a group of bandits, equipped with their own Zoids, attempt to seize Zeke, Van successfully fends them off with the Shield Liger.\n\nInside the facility, Van discovers a second cocoon containing a mysterious girl named Fiona. With no recollection of her past, Fiona is driven by the need to find an enigmatic object called the Zoid Eve. Together with Zeke, Van and Fiona embark on a thrilling adventure to unravel the mystery behind Fiona's origins and the true nature of the Zoid Eve.\n\nThroughout their journey, they encounter various friends and foes, becoming entangled in a conflict between the Republic and the Guylos Empire, which relies on Zoids for warfare.
