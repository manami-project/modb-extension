    "text": "Although the title 'Dragon Ball Daima' might hint at something sinister, with 'Daima' translating to 'Evil' in English, this new series by Akira Toriyama presents a fresh twist on the beloved characters. In this latest installment, Goku, Vegeta, Bulma, and other fan favorites find themselves in a peculiar predicament, as they are transformed into pint-sized versions of themselves due to a conspiracy. To restore their original forms, they embark on an exhilarating journey to an enigmatic world, filled with intense action and intriguing mysteries.\n\nDetermined not to let his small stature hinder him, Goku wields his trusty Nyoibo (Power Pole) in battle, a sight not witnessed for quite some time. Toriyama, who is deeply involved in the project, has crafted the story, settings, and many of the designs, promising an adventure that delves into the secrets of the Dragon Ball universe. Brace yourself for an extraordinary ride as these powerful yet adorable warriors face off in unique battles that are sure to captivate and entertain.",
