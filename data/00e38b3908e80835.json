  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cheerful and kind-hearted Remy, a young girl with a hidden talent for singing, resides in a quaint French town with her mother. After her father's return from a lengthy stint working in the city, Remy's life takes a dramatic turn as he reveals that she is not their biological daughter. In a cruel twist of fate, Remy narrowly escapes being sold to a wicked slave trader, only to be rescued by Vitalis, a wandering performer. Recognizing Remy's natural singing ability, Vitalis welcomes her into his troupe, where she embarks on a journey alongside his charming animal companions: a monkey named Joli-Coeur and three dogs, Capi, Dolce, and Zelbino.\n\nThroughout her travels, Remy encounters her birth mother and half-brother, Arthur, but remains oblivious to their true connection. As fate would have it, Remy departs for Paris without ever learning the truth. Heartbreakingly, Vitalis passes away, leaving Remy to face a series of trials and tribulations on her own. Despite the hardships she endures, Remy's resilience and passion for singing carry her forward in this poignant and captivating tale.",
