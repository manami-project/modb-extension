As the annual Cotton Drifting Festival approaches, the young shrine maiden Furude Rika, accompanied by her spiritual companion Hanyuu, finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of tragedy and death. In a desperate attempt to save her friends and unravel the dark mysteries surrounding the village, Rika repeatedly travels back in time, only to witness the same horrifying events unfold. As Rika's friends begin to recall fragments of their past lives, they join forces to challenge fate and put an end to the sinister curse of Oyashiro-sama.
