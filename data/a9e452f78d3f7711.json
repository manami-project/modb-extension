  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 1843 Edo, Japan is plagued by famine and unrest. Otherworldly monsters called Youi descend from the mountains and rise from underground, bringing chaos. Yukiatsu Ryuudou is a wanderer with a hidden past and the power of Ayagami - finding the true names of things. This ability could be key to fighting the Youi. When Yukiatsu helps a woman and child pursued by a Youi, he encounters the Bansha Aratamesho. This secret group battles the Youi threat. Recognizing Yukiatsu's power, they invite him to join their ranks as one of the Ayashi warrior-exorcists. To save the people, Yukiatsu must confront his painful history and embrace rather than deny his gifts. The Ayashi wage a shadow war against mythical beasts as social upheaval threatens to tear the land apart. Yukiatsu stands at a crossroads - run from his power or use it to protect the innocent. The fate of Edo may hinge on his decision.",
