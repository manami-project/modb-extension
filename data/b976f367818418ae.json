  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kirito remains trapped in a deep slumber as the war between the Human Empire and the Dark Territory, led by Gabriel, rages on in Underworld. With the help of Critter, Gabriel has recruited thousands of American players to wreak havoc on the Human Empire forces. Asuna, Sinon, and Leafa join the battle using super-accounts of Underworld deities, with Asuna fighting alongside the Human Empire forces, Sinon chasing after the kidnapped Alice, and Leafa arriving with her Earth Goddess powers. Lisbeth's passionate speech inspires many ALO players to join the fight, despite the risks. The fate of Underworld, the ultimate AI, and even humanity hangs in the balance. Meanwhile, in the real world, Yui and others seek support, but the prospect of real pain and loss deters many. As the battle intensifies, members of Rath work to restore Kirito's damaged fluctlight. With the stakes higher than ever, the epic conclusion of Akihiko Kayaba's dream of creating artificial human intelligence unfolds in this thrilling final season of Sword Art Online: Alicization - War of Underworld.",
