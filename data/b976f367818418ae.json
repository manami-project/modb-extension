  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The final battle for the fate of the Underworld is underway. Gabriel leads the Dark Territory forces, seeking to capture Alice and defeat the Human Empire. Thousands of American players, led by Critter, have logged into Underworld to join Gabriel's army. In response, Asuna, Sinon and Leafa enter Underworld with powerful super-accounts. Asuna becomes the Goddess of Creation Stacia, fighting alongside the Human Empire. Sinon gains the super-account of the Sun Goddess Solus and pursues Gabriel and Alice. Meanwhile, Leafa arrives as the Earth Goddess Terraria. Additionally, Lisbeth convinces ALO players to support the Human Empire despite the risks. The stakes are high - the future of Underworld, artificial intelligence, and perhaps mankind itself hangs in the balance. For now, Kirito remains unconscious, unable to aid in the fight. But if he awakens, the legendary Black Swordsman may turn the tide of this climactic war.",
