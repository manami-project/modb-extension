    "text": "Fabrique Nationale, SIG SG550, L85A1, and M16A4 - these aren't just high-powered assault rifles, they're also the names of four lively middle school girls attending Seishou Academy! In this unique slice-of-life anime, the students are more than meets the eye, as they're anthropomorphized versions of real military weapons. Newly appointed teacher Genkoku is about to embark on a wild ride as he navigates the unconventional world of armament-based education, where safety signs take on a whole new meaning and student-teacher relationships are anything but typical. As the girls embody the characteristics of their respective firearms, Genkoku must learn to adapt and handle his vivacious pupils with care, especially when the impulsive FNC sets her sights on him. Join these high-caliber cuties as they navigate the trials and tribulations of school life, providing viewers with a one-of-a-kind blend of humor, action, and educational insights into modern combat arms.",
