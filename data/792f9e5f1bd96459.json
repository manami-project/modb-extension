  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gray, a wolf nurtured by humans, finds himself in a dire situation after fatally attacking the family dog on a rural northern US farm. To prevent his father from killing the wolf, Lasset, the teenage boy who raised Gray, embarks on a challenging journey through the wilderness. Their destination is a sanctuary located 300 miles north, where Gray can live in peace. The bond between the boy and the wolf is beautifully depicted against the backdrop of Dvorak's Serenade for Strings, the sole musical piece used in the anime. The film, while predictable, is a heartfelt portrayal of friendship and adventure, and is sure to resonate with viewers.",
