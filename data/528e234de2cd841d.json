    "text": "Kagome Higurashi and Inuyasha, a daring duo, are the centerpiece of a pair of captivating television commercials, created to mark the release of the Inuyasha manga and anime in Japan. These promotional gems, distinct from the anime's later promos, showcase exclusive animations that never made it to the television series. The first commercial graced the screens at the time of the manga's debut, while the second arrived just before the anime's premiere. Set against a backdrop of chaos and strife, the story follows the fearless half-demon Inuyasha and his resolute human partner Kagome, as they navigate through a tumultuous world together.",
