  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After making peace with the Neuroi nest above Gallia, the Witches squads seek to reestablish communication with the Neuroi, who have mysteriously vanished after a sudden attack. However, a massive new Neuroi nest soon appears over Europe, ruthlessly annihilating Allied forces. Word reaches Fuso that European Witches urgently need rescue and reinforcement. A support battalion is deployed, including former Striker captain Mio Sakamoto and civilian Yoshika Miyafuji, who wish to save their dear friends. Upon arriving, they discover the harsh brutality of this new threat, which shows no mercy as it continues to swallow more of Europe. To have any hope of pushing back this formidable foe, the Witches must fight harder than ever before. Bonds of friendship and duty are tested as the squadrons brace for a desperate campaign to save Europe. Yet even united, it remains uncertain if the Witches have the power to overcome an enemy that wiped out entire wings within days. The key may lie within their ability to understand what truly motivates this alien menace.",
