  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Strike Witches are back in action, following their groundbreaking discovery that Neuroi can communicate with humans and their subsequent peace treaty with the nest above Gallia. However, the peace is short-lived as a sudden attack causes the Neuroi to vanish, leading to the discovery of a colossal new nest enveloping almost all of Europe. This new enemy shows no mercy, wiping out allied forces and numerous Witches. Upon hearing of the devastation, Fuso dispatches a support battalion to save the survivors. Among the rescue team are the former Striker captain, Mio Sakamoto, and the now-civilian Yoshika Miyafuji, both driven by the desire to save their cherished friends. With the stakes higher than ever, the Strike Witches must rise to the challenge and face this ruthless new foe.",
