    "text": "God Mars follows the journey of Marg, a lone survivor on the desolate planet of Gishin, after losing his brother Mars to the clutches of the tyrannical Zure and his parents. In a desperate bid to rebel against Zure's iron-fisted rule, Marg joins a guerrilla faction and finds love in Ruru, the leader's daughter. However, the group is decimated, leaving Marg captured and subjected to brainwashing to become one of Zure's soldiers.\n\nMarg's life takes a dramatic turn when he is unexpectedly reunited with his long-lost brother, Mars, but under harrowing circumstances â€“ they are pitted against each other in a duel. This alternate retelling of Marg's life on Gishin culminates in a high-stakes battle, with reimagined designs for Gaia, God Mars, and the Gishin robot Zeron. Prepare for an emotional rollercoaster as family ties are tested, and loyalties are pushed to their limits in this action-packed anime.",
