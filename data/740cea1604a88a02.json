    "text": "After competing in the intense 21st Choujin Olympics, Kinnikuman and his friends are approached by a desperate young boy named Beansman from the distant Planet Rakka. Beansman implores the heroes to help save his peaceful home planet from invasion by the ruthless Space Samurais, led by their merciless leader Black King. Always ready for a new adventure, Kinnikuman and the gang selflessly agree to aid Beansman and travel to Planet Rakka. Upon arriving, they discover a planet of humble farmers and villagers being terrorized by Black King and his army of cold-blooded samurai warriors. Echoing the classic film The Seven Samurai, Kinnikuman and friends vow to help the peaceful Beans people defend themselves from the impending attack. Training the mild-mannered Beansmen to fight, and preparing battle plans to outwit the mighty Space Samurais, Kinnikuman heads into another epic underdog conflict. With the odds stacked against them, the heroes must once again draw on their unmatched courage, honor and friendship to overcome a seemingly unstoppable foe. The fate of Planet Rakka hangs in the balance in this thrilling David and Goliath showdown.",
