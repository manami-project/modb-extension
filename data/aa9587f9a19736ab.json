    "text": "Prior to the premiere of the anime series \"Shin Shinka no Mi: Shiranai Uchi ni Kachigumi Jinsei\", a set of animated shorts were released on the official YouTube channel and Twitter account. Titled \"The Fruit of Evolution 2: Before I Knew It, My Life Had It Made\", these shorts aimed to generate interest and provide some background for the upcoming full series. While light on plot details, the shorts offered fans a small glimpse at the characters and world of \"Shin Shinka no Mi\" before the main story began. As an engaging promotional tactic, these animated shorts hopefully piqued viewer curiosity and set the stage for the adventures to come when the full anime starts airing.",
