    "text": "After being kicked out of her home in Onomichi City, high school student Nashiko Jippensha finds herself without a place to spend time with her friends. While wandering aimlessly, she stumbles upon her father's old, vacant mahjong parlor. Seizing the opportunity, Nashiko decides to fix up the dusty parlor so that she and her best friends - Izumi, Pai, and Riche - can hang out there. Together, the four girls tidy up the place, share laughs and good times over snacks and tea, and discover a newfound passion for mahjong. Though initially daunting, the intricate game proves to be great fun for them. Between intense matches filled with clever plays and lucky draws, the parlor becomes a refuge where the friends can simply enjoy their high school days.",
