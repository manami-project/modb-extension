  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She embarks on a rainy day, Minky Momo, aboard a train that carries more than just passengersâ€”it carries stories and forgotten relics. Engaging in conversation with an elderly gentleman, Momo learns of his quest to reconnect with someone of great significance. When she discovers his misplaced passport, Momo's journey takes an unexpected turn.\n\nHer path intertwines with that of her parallel self, hailing from another Minky Momo series, and a troubled young girl with a deep connection to the station. Together, they strive to help the girl navigate her challenges, all while uncovering the station's role in shaping the lives of those who pass through it.\n\nAs Momo delves deeper into the old man's story, she uncovers a pivotal moment in his family's history that is intrinsically linked to the Central Station. This grand hub of journeys serves as both a beginning and an end, a place where items are lost, and perhaps, where hearts can be found.",
