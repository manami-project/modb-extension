    "text": "When the sun sets and the world is at peace, a young train conductor embarks on his nightly journey, navigating a vibrant world where animals take on human-like forms. The train, filled with eccentric passengers, is a blend of chaos and delight, as elegantly dressed hippo ladies squeeze into carriages and mischievous pranksters wreak havoc. Meanwhile, a young boy cherishes a toy train gifted by his father, unaware that his slumber will lead him on a fantastical adventure into the realm of proper train etiquette, guided by the very train that now lies in his hands. Amidst the lively commotion, the dedicated conductor maintains order, ensuring a pleasant ride for all aboard, from banana peel-littering hippos to thirsty horses and restroom-bound travelers. A captivating fusion of live action, traditional animation, and stop motion, this anime invites viewers to embark on an unforgettable train ride filled with laughter, lessons, and a touch of enchantment.",
