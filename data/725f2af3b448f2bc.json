    "text": "Najimu Mujina, a typical five-year-old girl, finds herself in an atypical role as the CEO of Mujina Company. Despite her lack of business acumen and adult experience, she tackles tasks such as negotiations, golf outings, and social events with childlike enthusiasm. With her trustworthy and overly lenient secretary, Yuki Karuizawa, by her side, Najimu attempts to navigate the corporate world. Her innocent antics, while often causing unintended complications for her colleagues, including the dedicated employee Mayu Warito, also bring unexpected joy and inspiration to those around her. This heartwarming story follows Najimu as she takes on modern life with her unique perspective and boundless energy.",
