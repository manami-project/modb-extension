    "text": "Kashou Minazuki, son of a family of confectionery makers, moves out to open his own patisserie called La Soleil. Unbeknownst to him, two catgirls named Chocola and Vanilla, whom his family had been raising, stow away in his luggage. Though Kashou tries to send them back, the devoted catgirls plead to stay by their beloved master's side. Ultimately, Kashou relents and allows Chocola and Vanilla to join him in his new shop. Despite having no experience running a bakery, the determined Kashou puts his whole heart into making his dream a reality. Fortunately, he has the support of his caring sister and the two loyal catgirls, who try their very best to be helpful - though they occasionally fail in comical ways. With the combined efforts of this heartful makeshift family, La Soleil opens for business, promising laughter and antics aplenty from the well-meaning but bumbling catgirl duo. This lighthearted comedy follows Kashou's journey to build a successful bakery, filled with devotion from his feline companions, humor from their mishaps, and an abundance of love all around. Their dedication towards their master and desire to assist him leads to both warm and amusing moments. So come join this neko paradise at La Soleil patisserie, where business and pleasure go hand-in-hand!",
