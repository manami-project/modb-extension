  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Docooga, a ruthless global syndicate led by the nefarious Neo Neros, has its eyes set on a powerful new energy source known as Beamler, discovered after a meteor strike on Earth. To protect this energy, the inventor of the GoShogun, a formidable battle robot powered by Beamler, sacrifices himself to prevent Docooga from acquiring it.\n\nEnter an unlikely trio of heroes - former soldier Shingo Hojo, suave French spy Remy Shimada, and Bronx gangster Killy Gagley. They're not your typical do-gooders; they'd rather spend their time flirting and joking around. However, when Docooga threatens to steal the Beamler technology, they find themselves piloting the GoShogun and traveling the world in the teleporting fortress, Good Thunder, to thwart the syndicate's evil plans.\n\nAs they navigate the globe, the trio faces off against Docooga's eccentric enforcers and encounters various injustices they can't help but correct. Along the way, they also confront their own troubled pasts, adding a layer of depth to their wild adventures.\n\nWith its unique blend of drama, satire, and giant robot action, this anime offers a thrilling and unconventional take on the classic hero's journey. Join the crew aboard Good Thunder as they fight to protect the world from the clutches of Docooga, one epic battle at a time.",
