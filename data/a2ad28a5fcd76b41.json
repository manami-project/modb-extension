    "text": "Hao and Jin Nian find themselves in a complex predicament as they navigate through an unwilling and superficial marriage. Despite Hao's long-standing feelings for Jin Nian, their union is far from romantic, and Hao lays down three stringent rules to govern their life together: no touching, no public disclosure of their marriage, and utmost secrecy about their living arrangement.\n\nThough their marriage lacks consent, it is not devoid of history. A chance encounter during a rainstorm intertwined their lives, leading to years of complicated dynamics and near-missed opportunities. Adding fuel to the fire, Hao's sister finds herself captivated by the enigmatic Jin Nian, further intensifying the emotional turmoil.\n\nAs they tread carefully in their false marriage, Hao and Jin Nian must confront their past and their feelings. Despite their long-standing friendship, the newlyweds remain enigmas to each other, making their journey to understanding and love a challenging yet intriguing one. Will they successfully navigate through their complicated history and find a way to make their marriage work? Only time will tell.",
