  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Qiao An Hao and Lu Jin Nian find themselves in an arranged marriage that neither desired. Despite secretly harboring feelings for each other for years, a complicated history stands in their way. On their wedding night, An Hao establishes strict rules to keep their relationship superficial - no touching, no public displays of affection, no cohabitation. She aims to simplify their complicated situation. However, the years of misunderstandings and missed connections won't be easy to overcome. When a chance encounter brought them together years ago, it also tore them apart as An Hao's sister fell for the stoic Jin Nian. Now, husband and wife in name only, will they find a way to reconnect and turn their broken union into a true marriage? Or will the rules meant to protect them end up being their undoing? Behind the superficial lies a deeper story of fated love struggling against the tides of circumstance.",
