  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Through a blend of archival footage and animation, \"Kurayami Santa\" transports viewers to the bustling Showa-era Japan of the 1960s, where greed and selfishness are rife. Enma Daiou, the King of Hell, summons a young boy named Santa, who is tasked with preventing an imminent catastrophe. The wave of human greed threatens to overwhelm Hell with an unprecedented influx of souls, and Santa is Hell's chosen envoy to restore balance.\n\nWith no clear guidelines or rules, Santa is left to his own devices to handle the situation as he sees fit. A fierce thunderstorm heralds his arrival in the human world, where he quickly discovers that humans are indeed as wicked as Enma had warned. As a familiar from Hell, Santa must navigate the delicate balance between the human world and the spirit realm, encountering a diverse array of humans and supernatural creatures along the way. In the heart of 1960s Kyushu, Santa embarks on his mission to prevent the impending disaster and restore order to both worlds.",
