    "text": "Tenguushi City, like many other places around the world, is plagued by catastrophic events known as spacequakes. These disasters, caused by otherworldly beings called Spirits, have been a global threat for the past thirty years. When ordinary high school student Shidou Itsuka finds himself in the midst of one such spacequake, he encounters a mysterious sword-wielding girl named Tohka. Shidou soon learns from his sister Kotori that Tohka is one of the Spirits responsible for the spacequakes. To protect humanity and prevent further devastation, Shidou must embark on an unconventional mission: date these powerful Spirits and make them fall in love with him, as it's the only way to seal their powers and neutralize the threat they pose to mankind. As Shidou navigates through this extraordinary task, he discovers that the fate of the world rests in his ability to win the hearts of these enigmatic beings.",
