    "text": "To regain their lost witching abilities, Doremi Harukaze and her friends must embark on a new journey filled with challenges and adventures. The Witch Queen has granted them a second chance, but only if they can prove themselves worthy to the high-ranking witches who initially disagreed with the decision. To do so, they must learn the art of baking under the guidance of a new witch apprentice, Momoko Asuka, who has spent many years in a New York bakery owned by a witch. Together, they must convince the six senior witches that they deserve to be full-fledged witches once again. With Momoko's help, Doremi and her friends will face the trials of the Witch World, improve their language skills, and master the art of making sweets, all while wearing their special baking costumes and cute headsets in the bakery store. Get ready for a magical and delicious adventure in the third season of Ojamajo Doremi!",
