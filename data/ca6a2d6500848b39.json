  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After losing their magical powers, Doremi and her friends are finally granted the opportunity to become witches again. However, there's a catch - they must start from scratch and pass difficult witch qualification exams. To help the girls, the Witch Queen introduces Momoko, an apprentice witch who joins them from New York. Momoko spent years assisting a witch-owned bakery, so she helps Doremi and friends learn baking and sweets-making to win over skeptical senior witches. Together, the five friends - Doremi, Hazuki, Aiko, Onpu, and new teammate Momoko - embark on amusing adventures and work hard to prove themselves worthy of being full-fledged witches once more. Along the way, they must convince a witch council that previously denied their request while also opening a charming new bakery shop.",
