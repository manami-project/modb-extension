  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Because he witnessed a forbidden sight, Yo Hinomura, a once ordinary Japanese potter, was coerced into becoming an assassin for the Chinese mafia known as the 108 Dragons. His extraordinary skills and agility made him the most feared assassin in the world, but his remorse for his victims earned him the nickname 'Crying Freeman.' When Emu Hino, a talented but solitary Japanese artist, witnesses one of his murders, she becomes his next target. However, love blossoms between them, forcing Yo to choose between his duty and his heart. As they attempt to leave their past behind and start a new life, they must confront betrayal within the 108 Dragons and a new threat in the form of the African Tusk, a ruthless gang of political mercenaries. Can Yo protect his love and exact revenge on those who have wronged him, or will the Crying Freeman finally meet his match?",
