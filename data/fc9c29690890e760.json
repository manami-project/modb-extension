  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Trouble continues to find Rito Yuuki, an ordinary high school boy whose life was turned upside down when the alien princess Lala came to Earth and declared her intent to marry him. Now, Rito's home is filled with extraterrestrial girls - Lala, her genius inventor younger twin sisters Nana and Momo, and Golden Darkness, an assassin originally sent to kill Rito. However, new chaos arises when the flirtatious Momo reveals her plan to create a harem for Rito, insisting it is normal for the future king of Deviluke (the planet Lala and her sisters are from) to have multiple partners. Though reluctant, Rito now faces the possibility of intimate relationships not only with Lala, but also with Momo and other girls who may take an interest. Things grow more complicated with the arrival of a mysterious red-haired girl named Mea Kurosaki, who enters the school with an unrevealed mission. As this new threat looms, Rito and the alien girls must stand together to protect their friendships and way of life on Earth.",
