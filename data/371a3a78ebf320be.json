  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryuu Yamada, the protagonist of \"Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches,\" accidentally swaps bodies with Daichi Shinagawa from \"Yankee-kun to Megane-chan.\" As Ryuu struggles to reverse the body swap, the two anime worlds collide in comedic fashion. To celebrate this crossover, the first Blu-ray release of the \"Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches\" anime will include bonus content uniting the two series. Fans can look forward to a collaborative manga bringing together characters from both shows, as well as a short anime adaption. This continues the tradition of crossover stories between the two franchises, after a previous one-shot manga in 2013. With body-swapping hijinks and the charm of an unlikely crossover, this release promises a delightful blend for fans of \"Yamada-kun and the Seven Witches\" and \"Yankee-kun to Megane-chan.\" The two eccentric protagonists, Ryuu and Daichi, are sure to play off each other for maximum comedic effect as they try to return to normal. And the collaborative manga and anime will allow fans to see the characters interact in fresh, new ways.",
