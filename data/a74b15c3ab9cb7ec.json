  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It was just another ordinary day for Sergeant Keroro, an extraterrestrial frog-like creature hailing from the distant planet Keron, as he accompanied his young human friend Fuyuki Hinata to purchase a coveted Gundam model. Stumbling upon a concealed shrine during their journey home, the duo inadvertently damages an enigmatic vase, unbeknownst to them that this act would unleash an ancient Keronian weapon named Kiruru, triggering a series of peculiar occurrences throughout the town.\n\nOriginally dispatched to Earth with the objective of conquest, Keroro and his platoon have found themselves becoming increasingly attached to their newfound lives on this vibrant planet. Keroro, in particular, has developed a strong bond with Fuyuki, often prioritizing their shared pastimes over his intended mission.\n\nWhen the townspeople, including the Hinata family and the Keroro Platoon, awaken to find a mysterious 'X' mark on their faces, they are granted telepathic abilities. While some view this as a blessing, it may actually be a harbinger of a long-dormant Pekopon invasion. As the enigmatic Mirara, who harbors secrets about Kiruru, emerges, the group must now confront the potential consequences of their actions and find a way to safeguard Earth.",
