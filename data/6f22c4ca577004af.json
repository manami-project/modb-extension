Fast forward to his teenage years, Phoron is now a student at the prestigious Tolvas Commandia Academy, where aspiring Dantists hone their skills to command spirits through the power of music. During a practice session, Pnorn's off-key attempt at a new melody unexpectedly summons Corticarte once again, binding them in a contract and sealing their fates together.\n\nIn this prequel to the previous season, the story unfolds at Commandia Academy, where Phoron and his friends navigate the complexities of controlling spirits and mastering the art of Commandia.

With an ominous threat looming on the horizon, could this seemingly ordinary orphan be the key to averting impending doom?
