  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Once again, the first day of August marks the beginning of a perplexing journey for our protagonist, who awakens in a strange cafe with an unsettling sense of amnesia. With no recollection of her past life, she is left questioning her identity and the events that led her to this unfamiliar place. Enter Orion, a self-proclaimed spirit who promises to help her navigate the labyrinth of her forgotten memories.\n\nAs she embarks on this quest for self-discovery, she encounters people who seem to know her: a childhood friend, a senior, and even a lover. Yet, their faces and names remain a mystery to her. With only a mobile phone filled with unrecognizable contacts and Orion's guidance, she strives to piece together the fragments of her past.\n\nSet in a fictional world, this tale weaves a complex web of relationships and forgotten memories. As our heroine grapples with her amnesia, she must tread carefully to avoid arousing suspicion among those who claim to be close to her. With each passing day, she inches closer to uncovering the truth about her past and the enigmatic Orion. Will she be able to forge new memories while unraveling the old ones, or will her past remain a puzzle forever unsolved? Only time will tell.",
