    "text": "Ezo becomes the battleground for Chizuru Yukimura and the remaining Shinsengumi members, following their crushing defeat and the loss of some comrades. As the Meiji Era dawns after 260 years of the Edo Era, the clash between the new government's soldiers and former Tokugawa retainers continues to rage. Amidst this tumultuous backdrop, the Shinsengumi, now rebranded as the Kouyou Chinbutai, struggle to maintain their unity and sanity.\n\nActing commander Toshizou Hijikata grapples with the burdens of leadership and a terrifying new bloodlust that threatens to consume him and his subordinates. Meanwhile, the wounded commander Isami Kondou returns with imperial orders to defend the castle, adding further pressure to the beleaguered group.\n\nAs the flames of war threaten to engulf them, Chizuru and the Shinsengumi must navigate the treacherous battlefield and confront their personal demons. With allegiances shifting and the balance of power in constant flux, Chizuru's bond with Hijikata deepens as she continues her desperate search for her missing father. The stage is set for a climactic showdown in Hakuoki: Record of the Jade Blood.",
