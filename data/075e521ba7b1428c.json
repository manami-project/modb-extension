Retaining his memories and knowledge from his previous life, Rudeus is determined to make the most of his second chance, vowing not to repeat past mistakes. As he grows up under the loving care of his parents, Rudeus discovers his prodigious magical abilities, which he hones with the help of a mage named Roxy Migurdia and his sword-wielding father, Paul. Despite his innocent facade, Rudeus remains an otaku at heart, using his newfound charm and old-world knowledge to win the hearts of women he could never have dreamed of before.
