    "text": "Tachibana Mei, a reserved and introverted girl, has spent her entire 16 years without a boyfriend or friends, choosing to remain isolated after a traumatic childhood experience. One day, she accidentally injures the most popular boy in school, Kurosawa Yamato, but instead of retaliating, he takes an inexplicable interest in her and unilaterally declares her his friend. As their relationship unfolds, Yamato protects Mei from a stalker with an unexpected kiss, leaving her questioning her decision to remain aloof. As they navigate the complexities of their newfound relationship, Mei struggles to express her true feelings for Yamato and adapt to her new lifestyle, ultimately learning the true meaning of friendship and love.",
