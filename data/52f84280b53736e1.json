  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While the main series airs, six exclusive post-credit scenes are streamed on AbemaTV, offering viewers a deeper dive into the characters' lives. These specials, ranging from one to two minutes, expand on brief moments from episodes 1-4, 9, and 12, providing additional context and punchlines not fully explored in the main series. As Shinako Morinome reflects on her deceased friend during the tranquil hours of the night, Rikuo Uozumi's mundane days are enlivened by Haru Nonaka's vibrant personality. Despite feigning indifference, Rikuo appreciates the positive impact Haru has on his life.",
