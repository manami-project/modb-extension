  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the provided information, this anime follows the lives of Shinako Morinome and Rikuo Uozumi, who both experience emotional growth over the course of the series. Shinako is haunted by memories of her late friend, often reminiscing during quiet nights. Meanwhile, Rikuo's routine existence gains new meaning thanks to the vibrant Haru Nonaka. Though initially feigning indifference, Rikuo comes to appreciate how Haru brightens his days. The anime also features six specials, ranging from 1-2 minutes, that provide comedic insights into key moments from episodes 1-4, 9 and 12. Streamed exclusively after select episodes, these bonus scenes spotlight humorous aspects and punchlines only briefly touched on in the main story. With its poignant themes of grief, growth and friendship, complemented by amusing short specials, this anime promises an emotional yet entertaining viewing experience.",
