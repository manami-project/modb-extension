However, her middle school only has a boys' football club that refuses to allow her to join. Undeterred, Nozomi persistently asks the coach to give her a chance, longing to prove herself on the field. When Nozomi's childhood friend Yasuaki Tani confronts her on the street one day and challenges her abilities, her resolve only grows stronger. She is now more motivated than ever to take to the field in the upcoming season and demonstrate that girls can play just as well as boys. Despite facing physical and institutional barriers, Nozomi refuses to give up on her dream of beautiful football filled with fluid teamwork and exhilarating competition.",
