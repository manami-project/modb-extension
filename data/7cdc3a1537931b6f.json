  "synopsis": {
    "text": "STUDIO's 10th anniversary. A captivated girl finds herself inexplicably drawn to an enigmatic classmate with striking pink hair. Despite the classmate's aloof demeanor and preference to be identified as a boy in school, the girl's fascination only intensifies with each encounter. Eager to unravel the mystery surrounding this intriguing individual, she pursues them, only to find the chasm between them growing wider. This poignant tale of longing and connection is brought to life through a collaboration between renowned director Tetsurou Araki and musicians Hiroyuki Sawano and Motohiro Hata, as part of TOHO animation's 'Music Films' project. The official music video for COLORs, a track by Sawano and Hata, serves as the backdrop for this evocative short film.",
