  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Subaru is an ordinary schoolgirl whose world turns upside down when she stumbles upon a secret magical club at her school. She discovers that her best friend Aoi is a member, along with other girls who can magically transform. The club's unusual president is a tiny blob-like alien named Pleiadian who comes from the Pleiades star cluster. Pleiadian's spaceship crashed on Earth, and the fragments of its engine are scattered across the land. The magical girls' mission is to locate the fragments so Pleiadian can repair his ship and return home. When Subaru is selected by Pleiadian to join the club, she gains magical abilities of her own. However, Subaru and her new friends realize they are not the only ones searching for the alien engine parts. As Subaru adjusts to her new magical girl identity, she bonds with Aoi and the other club members while working together to find the spaceship fragments. It's a race against time before someone with ill intent locates them first. Along the way, Subaru discovers the power of friendship and that she has an important role to play in Pleiadian's quest to voyage back among the stars.",
