    "text": "Italy-bound soccer prodigy, Izumi Takuto, and renowned rock idol, Koji Nanjo, share a bond forged in their childhood years. Despite their respective successes, they both struggle with emotional intimacy and haunting pasts. When Izumi departs for soccer training without bidding farewell, Koji's pursuit to reconnect with him results in a tragic motorcycle accident that leaves him comatose. As Izumi grapples with his feelings, he becomes the key to awakening Koji from his comatose state. The emotional rollercoaster of their love story unfolds in the OVA series, Zetsuai 1989 and its sequel, Bronze Zetsuai 1989.\n\nComplementing the story, Cathexis is a captivating compilation of five music videos featuring Koji Nanjo, with never-before-seen moments between him and Izumi. As a special treat, the OVA concludes with an original art gallery by Minami Ozaki. Through these music videos, Koji inadvertently exposes the depth of his infatuation with Izumi, despite his efforts to maintain a guarded persona. This 30-minute OVA offers a unique perspective on their relationship and a visual feast for fans of the series.",
