  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Oshitari cousins, Yuushi and Kenya, attempt their hand at the Japanese comedy style of manzai. Yuushi, typically the straight man (tsukkomi), grows weary of his role and tries to be the funny man (boke) instead. However, his jokes do not land with his Hyoutei Academy tennis teammates. In another story, Kenya takes on the boke role but struggles to get laughs during a joint talent show between his school Shitenhouji and rival Namiwa. His teammate Hikaru kindly steps in to play the fool so Kenya can regain his dignity. Though the cousins aspire to comedy fame, it proves elusive. Their experiences highlight the difficulty of excelling in manzai, which relies on razor-sharp comic timing and instincts. Ultimately, the Oshitari cousins may be better suited to tennis than comedy. But their adventurousness reveals a creative spirit underlying their athletic pursuits.",
