    "text": "Hyoutei Academy's Oshitari cousins take center stage in these special episodes, showcasing their comedic talents in the traditional Japanese Manzai style. In the first story, Yuushi Oshitari, typically the straight man, grows weary of his role and attempts to take on the mantle of the funny man. However, his efforts lead to chaotic and hilarious outcomes. In the second tale, Kenya Oshitari, the usual funny man, struggles to land his jokes during a joint talent show between Namiwa and Seishun. Thankfully, his Shitenhouji Middle School tennis teammate, Hikaru Zaizen, steps in to turn the situation around, bringing laughter to the audience. Prepare for a rollercoaster of laughter and anticipation as these cousins navigate the world of comedy!",
