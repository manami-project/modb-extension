  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the realm of eternal darkness, a place known as the Abyssal Expanse, all is consumed and lost, leaving behind an endless void. From this darkness, entities manifest, embodying the turmoil and despair of mankind, and are named as the Harbingers. A team of eight brave young individuals unite to challenge these ominous beings and explore the depths of the Abyssal Expanse, which preys upon the human spirit.\n\nAs their past and present collide in a complex web of destiny, these young heroes strive to uncover a hopeful future beyond the desolate shadows of the Abyssal Expanse. However, their mission becomes increasingly perilous as they confront not only the Harbingers but also a new, formidable enemy - a 'Corpse' whose lethal melody is said to claim the lives of those who hear it within nine days.\n\nWith the haunting echoes of the Corpse Song lingering in their minds, the group starts to fracture as they become entangled in their own personal struggles, putting the very fate of humanity at risk. Can they overcome their inner turmoil and stand together against the forces of darkness, or will they succumb to the inevitable doom that the Abyssal Expanse promises?",
