    "text": "May the games begin! In the vibrant world of Animal Olympic Games, created by Yasuji Murata during the 1928 Amsterdam Olympic Games, a lively day of sports unfolds! For the diverse group of animals, it's a thrilling opportunity to showcase their skills and stamina in a series of exciting competitions.\n\nWatch as agile monkeys swing gracefully on the high bar, using both their hands and tails to perform breathtaking acrobatics. Marvel at the sight of bears and a hippo diving fearlessly from great heights into a small pool, demonstrating remarkable courage and precision. And let's not forget the intense one-on-one combat in the boxing ring, where kangaroos and pigs go head-to-head in a test of strength and endurance.\n\nThis animated spectacle perfectly captures the spirit of the Olympics, especially as Japan made significant strides in the Los Angeles Olympic Games in July 1932, securing an impressive seven gold medals. Join the fun and witness the thrilling competitions that await in the Animal Olympic Games!",
