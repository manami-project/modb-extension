  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a world forever altered by the impact of a black meteorite, grotesque creatures known as D2 have taken over, drawn to and repelled by the power of music. As the D2 began their relentless onslaught, music was banned to prevent further devastation. But all hope is not lost, as a group of young women known as Musicarts have risen to resist the monsters. These brave individuals wield the power of musical scores, using the very thing the D2 fear to fight back.\n\nIn the year 2047, America lies in ruins, a shadow of its former self. Among the survivors, Takt, a Conductor, forms a partnership with a Musicart named Destiny. Takt's deep longing for the return of music in the world is matched only by Destiny's burning desire to eradicate the D2. Together, they embark on a dangerous journey to New York, guided by the belief that their combined melody will bring hope and joy back to humanity.\n\nIn this desolate world where music has been silenced, Takt and Destiny's symphony of courage may be the last hope for a future filled with harmony. Will their journey lead to the rebirth of music, or will the darkness of the D2 consume them? Only time will tell, as Takt Op. unfolds the tale of their epic adventure.",
