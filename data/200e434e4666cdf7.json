    "text": "Set in the Stone Age, the animated comedy series follows the mischievous and adventurous life of Kum Kum, a young boy living in a cave with his family. As a member of the Mountain People, Kum Kum and his tribe reside near the Fire Mountain, where they hunt and farm for survival. Kum Kum's curiosity and knack for trouble-making often lead him and his friends on exciting escapades, with his father Strong Arm disciplining him by confining him in a storage cave for reflection. Despite the everyday challenges of prehistoric life, Kum Kum's carefree spirit and the support of his friends, including Sauro, the peace-loving brontosaurus, make for a heartwarming and entertaining tale of friendship and growth.",
