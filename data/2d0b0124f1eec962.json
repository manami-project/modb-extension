    "text": "All his life, Nobuaki Kanazawa has been uprooted from school to school, but none have been as harrowing as his current one. After a traumatic event at his previous school, Nobuaki is hesitant to form bonds with his new classmates, but a school-wide relay race begins to thaw his icy exterior. However, this fleeting moment of happiness is shattered when an ominous text message from a mysterious figure known as \"The King\" is sent to every student in his class. Having experienced the horrors of \"The King's Game\" before, Nobuaki knows all too well the deadly consequences that await those who refuse to participate or fail to follow the orders within 24 hours. As his classmates dismiss the message as a harmless prank, Nobuaki must face his dark past and convince them that the game is all too real, and that their lives are now at stake. With no escape in sight, Nobuaki is once again trapped in a vicious cycle of survival, forced to choose between saving himself or protecting those around him. Based on the manga \"Ousama Game Extreme,\" this anime adaptation promises a thrilling and suspenseful ride that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.",
