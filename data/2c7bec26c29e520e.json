  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keitaro, a young student aiming to attend Tokyo University, works as the manager of Hinata Inn, an all-girls dormitory, while preparing for his entrance exams. After an accident at the university entrance ceremony leaves him with a broken leg, Keitaro re-evaluates his goals and joins his mentor Seta on an overseas archaeology trip. In Keitaro's absence, his self-proclaimed sister Kanako arrives at Hinata Inn proclaiming herself the new manager. This causes chaos and conflict with the tenants. Just as tensions rise, Keitaro returns from his trip, only to find the Inn in disarray. He must deal with Kanako's claims and repair relations with the tenants, all while still pursuing his dream of attending Tokyo University with his close friend and potential love interest Naru. Despite the complications and misadventures that fill Keitaro's life, he remains determined yet good-natured as he works towards his goals and manages the rambunctious tenants of Hinata Inn. Though the road ahead is long, Keitaro holds out hope that someday all his efforts will pay off - he'll be accepted to Tokyo University and also sort out his muddled romantic feelings for Naru.",
