  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows Seishuu Handa, a talented, handsome, yet narcissistic calligrapher who finds himself exiled to the remote Gotou Islands after a public outburst at a prestigious exhibition. Seeking a peaceful retreat to rediscover his artistic inspiration, Seishuu is instead greeted by the lively and eccentric island inhabitants who are eager to welcome him into their community.\n\nAs Seishuu attempts to adjust to his new life, far from the luxuries of Tokyo, he finds his tranquility constantly disrupted by the island's boisterous children, curious neighbors, and unconventional customs. At the forefront of these interruptions is Naru Kotoishi, a spirited seven-year-old girl who is determined to make the most of the new arrival's presence.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance, Seishuu gradually becomes entwined in the island's quirky charm and the lives of its residents. As he navigates through a series of comedic and heartwarming interactions, Seishuu may just find the unique style and inspiration he's been searching for, along with valuable life lessons he never knew he needed.",
