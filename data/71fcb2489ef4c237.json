  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A millennium ago, humanity's hubris precipitated an ecological disaster that destroyed civilization and created a toxic jungle guarded by giant insects. Nausica채, the kind and courageous princess of the Valley of the Wind, leads her seaside kingdom in a struggle to survive. Though peace-loving, Nausica채 is a skilled warrior who soars the skies and communicates with the jungle's insects. When a crashed airship brings war to the Valley, Nausica채 works to stop the violence, convince people of the importance of the environment, and restore humanity's connection to the Earth. Through appeasement and truth, she and her allies take to the skies and seas on birds and ships to bring empathy and reconciliation to belligerent nations still fearful of the spreading jungle. Nausica채 strives to show that humanity and nature can flourish together once more.",
