    "text": "Mash Burndead dreams of becoming a Divine Visionary, the highest rank for magic users, but he harbors a dangerous secret - he cannot actually use magic himself. After revealing this during a battle, Mash is put on trial, with the fearsome wizard Orter MÃ¡dl calling for his execution. However, the mysterious Innocent Zero intervenes, demanding Mash be kept alive to battle them instead. Though spared for now, Mash's problems are far from over. The Divine Visionaries still unanimously agree he should die after dealing with Innocent Zero. Thankfully, Mash finds support from some powerful allies, including the headmaster of his magic academy. They manage to defer his execution on one condition: Mash must be selected as a Divine Visionary candidate by the end of the year. With deadly enemies lurking in the shadows, Mash and his friends now face a race against time. They must train night and day for the upcoming exams, all while protecting Mash from those seeking to eliminate him before he can achieve his dream of becoming a Divine Visionary.",
