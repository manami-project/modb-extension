Haruka Nanase and Makoto Tachibana enroll at the same university, excited yet nervous to adapt to big city life. When tasked with filling in for Iwatobi's mascot at a televised regional wrestling tournament, they reluctantly take the job, unaware their friends are watching. Meanwhile, former teammates reunite across Tokyo - Nagisa, Rei and Gou indulge in festival games and food while awaiting the tournament's broadcast; Ikuya Kirishima and Hiyori Toono, now university roommates, bond over memories of adjusting to city life; Rin Matsuoka leaves for Australia to pursue Olympic dreams. Though separated, fond memories bring warmth during this season of change. Before the new term begins, familiar bonds strengthen and new friendships blossom. Haruka, Makoto and friends soon realize that while life's tides may shift, their connection through swimming will keep them anchored together, no matter where the future may lead.",
