    "text": "After World War II, two superpowers emerged - the Federal Republic of Zirnitra in the East and the United Kingdom of Arnack in the West. Hungry for more power, they turned their sights to space, competing fiercely to develop the technology for manned space missions. In 1960, Zirnitra's leader Gergiev announced an ambitious plan called Project Mechtat to launch the first human into orbit. Behind closed doors, Zirnitra was secretly preparing vampires as stand-ins for humans using the Nosferatu Project. After an incident derailed his astronaut training, Lev Leps was assigned to oversee the vampire Irina Luminesk's training to become a test subject. Despite challenging setbacks from failed experiments and nationalistic pressure, Lev and Irina bonded through their shared dream of space travel. Could their ambition and grit be enough to propel them past their terrestrial troubles and into the cosmos? The race was on between two countries determined to make history among the stars.",
