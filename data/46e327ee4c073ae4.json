    "text": "As the reign of Mama Megami, the divine protector of a utopian paradise, comes to an end, the search for her successor's guardians begins. The chosen heir appoints Lilith, a young mage, to recruit two capable guardians. However, Lilith's task proves challenging when her first candidate, Stashia, shows no interest, and a misunderstanding prevents her from approaching the second candidate, Juliana, a skilled warrior. Meanwhile, Rurubell, Stashia's younger sister, aspires to become a guardian, but her inexperience and tender age disqualify her. As the paradise faces the looming threat of an evil goddess seeking dominance, Lilith, Stashia, Juliana, and Rurubell must unite to defend their home and safeguard the Astro Star, a magical artifact that purifies evil from the outside world. Can they protect their paradise from the clutches of darkness?",
