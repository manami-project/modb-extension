    "text": "Elysium, a distant alien planet, declares war on Earth in 2113, following a misunderstanding that leads to the destruction of one of its spacecraft. The overpopulated Earth, now a dystopian landscape, is caught off guard, resulting in widespread devastation. Amidst the chaos, Van, an 18-year-old pizza delivery boy and turbo jai alai racing enthusiast, finds himself conscripted as a space knight to defend his home planet.\n\nVan, who dreams of escaping the polluted cityscape with his ballerina girlfriend, Lydia, sees his world turned upside down as cities burn and lives are lost. The once thrilling turbo jai alai racing stadium becomes a deadly battleground, forcing Van to navigate the chaos on his turbo-cycle to rescue Lydia.\n\nAs the war intensifies, the fate of Earth rests in the hands of Van and three other knights. Their mission: to wield ancient relics hidden deep beneath the Earth's surface. These relics, discovered in an Antarctic cavern amidst strange land markings, hold the key to Earth's survival.\n\nWith Elysium's forces closing in and Armageddon looming, Van and his fellow knights must harness the power of these relics to save Earth and its inhabitants from total annihilation. Will they succeed, or will Earth fall to the alien onslaught? The future hangs in the balance.",
