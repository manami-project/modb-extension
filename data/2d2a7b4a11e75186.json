  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyōsuke Hyōbu, a silver-haired young man clad in a mournful black uniform, leads the criminal esper organization, P.A.N.D.R.A., through the dark sky on wings as black as midnight. Once betrayed, he is now one of the most powerful ESPers and a fugitive, determined to revolutionize the world for his fellow espers. Despite his intimidating demeanor, Kyōsuke's true intentions are to save ESPers who are mistreated by humans, even if it means using force. His noble cause has earned him the loyalty of many ESPers, making P.A.N.D.R.A. a formidable force against those who seek to enslave or kill individuals with psychic powers. As the leader of P.A.N.D.R.A., Kyōsuke is prepared to unleash his full potential, even if it means removing the device that limits his incredible range of abilities, to protect his brethren and fight against the fate of time itself.",
