    "text": "Deemo is a lonely figure who plays haunting melodies on a piano in an empty castle. When a young girl with no memories falls from the sky into this mysterious world, the two form an unlikely bond. As Deemo continues playing his piano, a magical tree grows taller with every note. The girl comes to realize this tree may hold the key to recovering her lost memories and returning home. However, she has grown attached to her new friend Deemo, who has enjoyed the companionship he never thought he'd find. They are joined in the castle by quirky residents, each concealing their own secrets. Over time, the heartwarming tale of the girl, Deemo, and the townspeople unfolds through the resonating music of the piano. What will the girl discover about her clouded past? Will she choose to stay or leave this strange place she now calls home? The ending to this ephemeral fairy tale has yet to reveal itself.",
