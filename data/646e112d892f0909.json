    "text": "Now here-near-ordinary, Norio finds himself the center of unexpected romantic attention, triggering a chain of events that unveils a hidden world beyond his wildest dreams. A tumble down the stairs and into the embrace of a captivating stranger marks the onset of an extraordinary journey. In this clandestine society, unique individuals have evolved from animals other than primates, such as leopards and bears, and Norio represents an exceedingly uncommon lineage. His coveted DNA now places him in the crosshairs, making survival in this contemporary urban jungle a formidable challenge.\n\nIn this 2003 sci-fi narrative, the intricate web of romantic connections between these evolved men unfolds, as Norio—born to ordinary parents—grapples with his newfound heritage. Enigmatic figures, such as Kunimasa, who takes it upon himself to train Norio, and Yonekuni, Kunimasa's brother harboring disdain for all men, enter his life. Shiro, the class president nursing a secret crush on Yonekuni, and other allies join Norio as he navigates high school and delves deeper into the mysteries of his ancestry.",
