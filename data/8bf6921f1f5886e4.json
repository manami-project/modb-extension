    "text": "Planet Vegeta, once teeming with peculiar lifeforms, was believed to have been obliterated along with Bardock, Goku's father, in a cataclysmic attack orchestrated by the ruthless Freezer. However, in a twist of fate, Bardock finds himself hurled back in time, landing in an era where the planet thrived with bizarre creatures. In this unfamiliar terrain, Bardock crosses paths with Chilled, a space-faring pirate who also happens to be an ancestor of Freezer. With the planet's future hanging in the balance, Bardock takes a stand against Chilled, sparking a battle to safeguard the strange yet endearing world he has stumbled upon. This riveting tale of time travel, lineage, and unexpected heroism was first unveiled at Jump Festa 2012, held in December 2011.",
