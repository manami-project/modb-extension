  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Super ior forces from the malevolent Boazan Empire threaten Earth's very existence, but a prophetic defense plan is already in motion. Dr. Goh, a genius Boazanian outcast who sought refuge on Earth, collaborated with Earth's defense forces to create a formidable weapon: the Chodenji Machine Voltes Five. Now, Dr. Goh's three sons, Kenichi, Daihhiro, and Hiyoshi, along with General Oka's daughter Megumi and a former rodeo star, Mine Ippei, pilot the five-part robot to protect Earth from the invading horned aliens. As the second installment in Tadao Nagahama's Romance Super Robot Trilogy, Voltes V combines the power of its five vehicles to thwart the enemy's schemes and wields a mighty laser sword to vanquish their robotic forces. The fate of Earth rests in the hands of these brave young pilots and their incredible machine.",
