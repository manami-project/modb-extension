    "text": "In the early 21st century, an incurable condition known as B-Cell growth emerged, forcing some affected people into stasis as \"Sleepers\" until a cure could be found. Yuji Kaido was one such Sleeper who awakens decades later into a nightmarish new world. While Yuji slept, an alien species called the Blue invaded and conquered Earth, pushing humanity to the brink of extinction. Yuji joins a team sent to extract him from the ruins of civilization. Together they battle through the horrors of war against the merciless Blue in order to reach the safe haven of Second Earth, a space station built to one day reclaim the planet. However, Yuji and his companions find their humanity tested as they fight to survive against these insectoid aliens. With mankind's future at stake, the Sleepers may be the key to reclaiming Earth. But the traumatic struggle against the seemingly unstoppable Blue may leave both physical and emotional scars. Ultimately, the ability to hold on to one's humanity while battling inhumane enemies may determine whether humans can ever take back their planet.",
