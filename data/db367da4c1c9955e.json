    "text": "Gauma, a self-proclaimed \"kaiju user,\" crosses paths with Yomogi Asanaka, a first-year student at Fujiyokidai High School. The unexpected appearance of a kaiju and the colossal robot, Dynazenon, validates Gauma's mysterious claims. In an unfortunate twist of fate, Yume Minami, Koyomi Yamanaka, and Chise Asukagawa find themselves entangled in the battle against the kaiju.\n\nIn a world where monstrous kaiju threaten to rule, Gauma's mission is to thwart the Kaijuu Eugenicists, who aim to control these beasts through their power, \"Instance Domination.\" To combat this menace, Gauma wields an ornament that summons the mighty Dynazenon, a battle robot requiring four pilots to navigate its four independent parts. As fate would have it, Gauma's co-pilots become Yomogi, his classmate Yume Minami, and an older, unemployed man named Koyomi Yamanaka.\n\nWhile battling the kaiju and the Kaijuu Eugenicists, the group also faces personal challenges. Yume, for instance, is determined to uncover the truth behind her sister Kano's death, drawing her closer to Yomogi. Set in the shared \"Gridman universe,\" this enthralling series follows Yomogi and his friends as they navigate their lives and confront the formidable kaiju.",
