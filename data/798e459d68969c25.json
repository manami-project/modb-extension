With the ability to traverse time, Fatz and his team aboard the Seahorse set sail to gather the scattered fragments of the Peace Stones, each representing a unique element: Light, Darkness, Fire, Water, Air, Earth, Wood, and Metal.

Among Fatz's crew are the enigmatic mermaid Lady Maid, the formidable Wave Knight, and the spirited boy Tushi Warashi. As a skilled swordsman and wielder of the Peace Stones' powers, Fatz aims to restore harmony to the world while simultaneously breaking the curse that binds him to his unwanted weight.
