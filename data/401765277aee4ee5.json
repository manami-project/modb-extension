  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on Japanese folklore and urban legends, \"Yami Shibai\" is a chilling anime that brings to life a series of short horror stories. Narrated by a masked storyteller, these spine-tingling tales are presented in a unique picture-story style of animation that emulates kamishibai, a traditional Japanese method of storytelling using paper scrolls. From a ventriloquist's dummy to a wish-granting locker, and a capsule toy machine that returns lost items, each story is more terrifying than the last. As the old man unfolds these eerie narratives to schoolchildren on a playground, viewers are transported into a world of the unknown and the occult, where the horrors of Japanese myths come alive in a truly petrifying manner.",
