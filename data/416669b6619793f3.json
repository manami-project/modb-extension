  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the night of a crimson full moon, high school student Mei Ayazuki is transported back in time to the Meiji era by a magician named Charlie. She arrives in an alternate Tokyo, where ghosts known as \"mononoke\" appear during the 'Misty Hour' between sunset and sunrise. In this unfamiliar world, Mei is taken to the Rokumeikan, an elegant ballroom filled with influential officials. There, she meets several prominent historical figures - authors, actors, and artists of the time. Mei discovers that she possesses the power to see ghosts, an ability known as \"Tamayori\" that is invaluable in the Meiji period. As Mei gets to know the charismatic men, relationships blossom. Her supernatural gift only deepens her bonds with them. While struggling to adapt to life in a different era, Mei must decide - should she remain in the past, or attempt to return to her own time when the next full moon arrives in a month? Her choice will determine the fate of an unconventional romance that defies the boundaries of time.",
