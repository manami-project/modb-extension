  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This prequel anime provides backstories on the main characters from Saiyuki before they formed their famous party and embarked on their Journey to the West. It depicts a younger Genjo Sanzo, who, following the death of his master, leaves his temple to retrieve the sacred Seiten Sutra. Plagued by nightmares, he wanders alone for four years before arriving at the Palace of the Setting Sun. There, he climbs Mt. Gogyou and discovers Son Goku, a monster imprisoned for 500 years, who then proceeds to follow Sanzo. The anime also explores the shared past of Hakkai and Gojyo. Some time after Hakkai's judgement at the Palace of the Setting Sun, he goes to live with Gojyo. Their hopes for a quiet life are disrupted when an old friend of Gojyo's appears, leading to further adventures. By chronicling the formative experiences of these iconic characters, the prequel provides intriguing backstories and sheds light on the bonds that would ultimately unite them. Their journey is just beginning.",
