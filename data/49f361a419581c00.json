    "text": "Chi you, Xingtian, King Zhou, and Jiang Ziya are just a few of the legendary figures that inhabit the Divine Seal World, a realm that has been reimagined and upgraded. In this world of saints, Daoist sects, and ancient gods and demons, a young man named Luo Lie finds himself unexpectedly summoned and forced to assume another person's identity.\n\nIn a land where factions are constantly vying for power and danger lurks around every corner, Luo Lie, who longs for home, must rely on his indomitable spirit and a mysterious ability he gained during his soul's journey. With these tools, he overcomes countless challenges and breaks through his own limitations, eventually gaining renown.\n\nBut as treacherous schemes and perilous situations close in on him, Luo Lie, who never intended to be a hero, finds himself on a heroic path with the help of his childhood sweetheart. Will he find himself facing an abyss of destruction, or will he be the one to clear the clouds and reveal the light?\n\nWith the mantra \"I am no hero, but I am a peerless genius,\" Luo Lie sets out to usher in a new era in the Investiture of the Gods.",
