    "text": "Michiru Saruwatari's rescue from a demon by Musashi marks the beginning of a relentless battle on Awaji Island. With the emergence of an invincible Kishin, the land of Hinomoto is now under the dominion of oni. Musashi and Kanemaki Kojiro, driven by a shared ambition to establish the most formidable Bushi band, form the Kanemaki Bushi with Hattori Tsugumi. Armed with the only weapons capable of slaying oni, the Kitetsu Blades, they embark on their mission.\n\nIn Harima, they cross paths with the colossal Uesugui Bushi and their leader, Uesugi Tatsuomi, who aim to eliminate the monstrous Kishin, Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed dragon threatening Awaji Island. The alliance also includes Takeda Naotora and the Takeda Bushi, alongside other young Bushi like Shimazu Akihiro and Amako Katsumi. Among them is the introverted princess, Saruwatari Michiru. As conflicting interests intertwine, Musashi and his companions join the Kishin hunt. The indomitable Yamata no Orochi, untouched by any prior attacks, sets the stage for an unprecedented battle.\n\nMeanwhile, Kojiro's discovery of his father's ties to the Uesugi clan propels him to partake in their punitive expedition against Yamata no Orochi. Musashi, grappling with his weakness and inability to collaborate, joins the alliance to enhance his skills.
