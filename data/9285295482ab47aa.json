  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the land of Hinomoto, humans live in fear of demonic oni that have taken over, led by the powerful Kishin. Two young bushi, Musashi and Kojiro Kanemaki, set out from their hometown seeking to form the strongest bushi band ever. They are joined by the skilled Hattori Tsugumi and establish the Kanemaki band. When Kojiro learns his father was part of the legendary Uesugi clan, they travel to join the Uesugi bushi. Led by Tatsuomi Uesugi, the Uesugi have gathered a massive military alliance to confront the giant eight-headed dragon Yamata no Orochi that threatens Awaji Island. Other groups like the Takeda bushi led by Naotora Takeda have also joined. As they prepare for battle, Musashi struggles with his own lack of strength and difficulty cooperating. Meanwhile, the sinister Obsidian Eight continues to hunt him, seeking to claim the obsidian goddess that dwells within Musashi's body. With various agendas in conflict, Musashi and his expanding group of allies head towards an epic confrontation with the seemingly unstoppable Yamata no Orochi. The ultimate test that will determine if Musashi's dream of having the strongest bushi band can become reality is about to unfold on Awaji Island.",
