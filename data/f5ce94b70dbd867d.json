  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime is a compilation that features both recycled animation from a previous OAV series, as well as new animation of additional scenes from the manga. Specifically, the new scenes depict events that chronologically take place before and after the storyline covered in the OAVs. Additionally, this release includes six music videos that contain footage not shown in the original OVA, some scenes adapted directly from the manga, a slightly altered version of the OVA's ending sequence, and ending credits unique to these videos. Overall, this anime aims to supplement and expand upon the existing OAV adaptation of the manga by featuring new animated content as well as reshaped existing content, with a particular emphasis on the manga's storyline not yet depicted. The music videos additionally provide fresh visual interpretations of the anime's musical content.",
