  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a quiet neighborhood, a young third-grader named Satoshi finds his life taking an unexpected turn when he witnesses a chilling sight: a peculiar woman brutally dragging a lifeless body. Coinciding with this unsettling event, a new girl, Satoko, moves in next door and joins Satoshi's class. As the rainy season casts a gloomy shadow, Satoko's unusual appearance makes her a target for cruel classmates, though Satoshi remains a bystander. However, the tables turn when Satoshi becomes the relentless prey of a mysterious, disfigured girl concealed behind a veil of long, dark hair.\n\nYears later, Satoshi returns to his hometown, haunted by the memories of his past and the enigmatic girl. This 3D CG-animated movie unravels the tale of Hikiko, a character from a Japanese urban legend, who endured constant torment and violence from her parents and peers, leaving her scarred and grotesque. Seeking vengeance, Hikiko abducts elementary school students, mercilessly dragging them until they're gruesomely mutilated. As Satoshi confronts his past, he must unravel the connection between the vengeful Hikiko and the tormented Satoko, and determine if the twisted cycle of abuse and retaliation can ever be broken.",
