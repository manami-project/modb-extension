  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ayase is a kind-hearted university student who finds his life turned upside down when his cousin Tetsuo, deep in gambling debt, auctions him off to the highest bidder. Business mogul Kanou emerges as the winner with an exorbitant bid, though his motives prove complex; he and Ayase share a mysterious history from years prior that only Kanou seems to recall. Kanou offers to erase Ayase's debt if he will stay by his side, yet his attachment soon morphs into obsession. With Ayase bound by debt and reliant on Kanou for housing and income, Kanou begins compensating him for sexual favors, slowly eroding the innocents he first coveted in the young man. As Ayase wrestles with the loss of his autonomy, he must determine if there is room for real intimacy to take root in such a transactional arrangement.",
