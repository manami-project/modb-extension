  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story takes place in a rural town undergoing a musical revival, centered around high school students Kanae and Sousuke. Their lives are turned upside down when personified versions of classical music legends - Beethoven and Mozart - mysteriously appear before them, calling themselves \"ClassicaLoids.\" When this eccentric duo plays their own unique blend of classical music infused with modern styles, dubbed \"mujik,\" strange phenomena occur - stars fall from the sky and giant robots materialize out of nowhere! As more ClassicaLoids, including Bach, Chopin, and Schubert, arrive in town, musical chaos and excitement ensues on a daily basis. It seems these classical geniuses possess wondrous creative powers through their music. However, with clashing artistic temperaments and unclear motives, it remains to be seen whether the ClassicaLoids are well-meaning allies or potential threats. Nonetheless, the arrival of these musical masters transforms the town and attracts classical music fans from far and wide.",
