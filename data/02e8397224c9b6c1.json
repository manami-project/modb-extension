  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Considered as the third entry in the renowned 'When They Cry' series by 07th Expansion, Umineko no Naku Koro ni unfolds on the secluded island of Rokkenjima, home to the affluent Ushiromiya family. In the year 1986, as the family patriarch, Kinzou, nears his end, a customary family conference is convened to discuss his inheritance. Eight family members, three residents, five servants, and Kinzou's personal physician gather on the island, only to be trapped by an unexpected typhoon. However, Kinzou's wealth distribution is not his only concern this year. Longing to reunite with his true love, the Golden Witch Beatrice, Kinzou resorts to black magic to resurrect her. As the storm rages on, a series of inexplicable murders ensues, plunging the eighteen inhabitants into a desperate battle for survival, blurring the lines between reality and fantasy. Drawing parallels to Agatha Christie's 'And Then There Were None,' the story of Umineko no Naku Koro ni takes a chilling turn as the prophecy of Beatrice's resurrection begins to materialize, leaving the potential heirs to question their fate on the isolated island.",
