  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a dystopian future, Japan is plagued by relentless terrorism, prompting the establishment of the Special Security Force (SSF), an elite law enforcement unit with unrestricted authority to maintain order. Among the SSF's ranks is Angel, an unyielding officer renowned for her combat prowess and determination to uphold justice. As Angel and her partner, Raiden, delve into a series of grisly murders targeting known criminals, they cross paths with the Hunters, a trio of psychics who mete out brutal justice against the city's underbelly.\n\nHowever, the moral compass of the Hunters begins to waver, with two members questioning their actions while the third descends into a bloodthirsty rampage, fueled by mysterious cybernetic enhancements. With the SSF now in the crosshairs, Angel must rely on unlikely alliances and her newly cyborged partner to bring the rogue psychic to justice and uncover the shadowy organization orchestrating the chaos. As they delve deeper, the line between friend and foe blurs, and the true extent of the government's involvement in the terrorism and the Hunters' powers comes to light. In this high-stakes battle, Angel must navigate the complex web of conspiracies and allegiances to protect the city and preserve the very essence of justice.",
