    "text": "Chihaya Ayase is a passionate high school student who dreams of seeing her karuta club become the best in Japan. As she enters her second year, Chihaya recruits new members to join the club at Mizusawa High School, aiming to eventually win the prestigious national team championship tournament at Omi Jingu. However, the road ahead is challenging. The new recruits are more interested in her friend Taichi than karuta itself; meanwhile, Chihaya faces stiff competition on her quest to become Queen, the top female karuta player in Japan. She also reunites with her childhood friend Arata Wataya, the prodigy who first introduced her to the competitive card game. Through hard work and dedication, Chihaya hopes to not only share her love for karuta with her new teammates, but also help them advance through tournaments as she continues striving for her goal of Queen. Despite inner-club rivalry and romantic distractions, the passion of the Mizusawa Karuta Club members pushes them forward against formidable opponents.",
