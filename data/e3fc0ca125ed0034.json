    "text": "Upon facing a family crisis, a young boy named Romeo courageously sells himself as a chimney sweep to help pay for his father's medical expenses. As he journeys to Milan, he forms a strong bond with a fellow chimney sweep, Alfredo, and the two become inseparable friends. Together, they navigate the harsh realities of their new life, facing cruel masters and violent street gangs. In response to these challenges, Romeo and Alfredo form a secret society called the \"Black Brothers,\" uniting the chimney sweeps in a common cause. Despite the hardships they face, the brothers remain steadfast in their mission to protect each other and those they love, ultimately fighting for justice and the truth. Inspired by the beloved children's book \"The Black Brothers\" by Lisa Tetzner, this anime tells a powerful story of friendship, resilience, and hope.",
