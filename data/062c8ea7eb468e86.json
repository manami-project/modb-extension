    "text": "Satomi's defeat and the end of the Selector battles seemed to promise a return to normalcy for Suzuko Homura and her friends. However, Kiyoi Mizushima suspects that the conflict is far from over, and her fears are soon confirmed when the Selector battle system re-emerges with a new twist. Players now receive a special key card that unlocks hidden powers, drawing Suzuko and her friends back into the fray. As the shadow of a new battle looms, Kiyoi seeks out skilled allies to help her put an end to the cycle of darkness. With the rules changed and a new map in play, the Selectors gather once again for a grand final battle that could restore Chinatsu's memories and finally bring peace to their world. Will Suzuko and Kiyoi be able to triumph in this cruel game and put an end to the Selector battles once and for all?",
