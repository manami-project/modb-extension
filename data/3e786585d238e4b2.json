  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During Japan's feudal era, the ninja clans Byakuro and Kabusu were engaged in a fierce rivalry. One fateful night, the Kabusu staged an attack on Byakuro castle, aiming to kidnap the infant Byakuro princess. Their plans were thwarted when a loyal Byakuro ninja rescued the princess and fled into hiding, later raising her as his own daughter. Years later, a group of young ninja trainees - Kaoru, Hayashi, Yume, Matsuri and Sakura - are given a pivotal mission. They must infiltrate the Kabusu-occupied Byakuro castle and retrieve a sacred scroll, in order to complete their ninja training. However, their mettle will be tested when they cross paths with three ruthless Kabusu sorcerers, still harboring hopes of capturing the long-lost Byakuro heir. Unbeknown to the trainees, the missing princess is in fact hiding amongst their ranks. With dark magic and subterfuge at play, these young ninja must band together to unlock the scroll's power and defend the princess from those who wish to do her harm. Their training and teamwork will be pushed to the limit as they combat deadly illusions and unravel sinister plots. The future of the Byakuro legacy - as well as their own - hangs precariously in the balance.",
