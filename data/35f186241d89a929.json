    "text": "Believing he's been blessed with a divine gift, a humble bamboo cutter named Okina discovers a radiant baby girl hidden within a glowing bamboo shoot in the tranquil Japanese countryside. Along with his wife Ounaa, they raise the extraordinary child as their own, naming her Kaguya. As she miraculously matures into a stunningly beautiful young woman, Okina's life is further transformed by the discovery of a hidden treasure.\n\nDetermined to provide a life befitting a princess, Okina relocates his family to a lavish villa in the capital, bestowing upon himself a noble title and enlisting tutors to refine Kaguya's grace and elegance. As word of her enchanting beauty spreads, a parade of wealthy suitors vie for her hand in marriage, including the emperor himself.\n\nHowever, Kaguya's heart yearns for the simplicity of her past life and the company of her childhood sweetheart, Sutemaru. As her celestial origins begin to unveil themselves, Kaguya grapples with the earthly desires that bind her to this world and the heavenly fate that awaits her.",
