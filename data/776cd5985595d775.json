  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokyo University of the Arts presents an award-winning, five-minute animation that redefines the concept of time. The story revolves around a man who repeatedly savors a drink in eight-second intervals. At first glance, the sequence appears identical, but with each sip, subtle changes unfold, adding a layer of intrigue. The protagonist, seemingly trapped in a loop, attempts to break free, but to no avail. This innovative piece expands and enlarges each frame, creating a luxurious and captivating experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional time-based narratives. Winner of the 2014 Anima Mundi Best Gallery Film, ANIMPACT Jury Special Prize, and Tokyo Anime Award Festival Graduation Work Adobe Prize, this animation is a must-watch for its unique exploration of time and change.",
