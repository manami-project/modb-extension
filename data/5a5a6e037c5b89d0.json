  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a disastrous calamity devastates Japan, the nation struggles to rebuild. Two young researchers, Umataro Tenma and Hiroshi Ochanomizu, pour their hopes into developing advanced robotics to aid this recovery. With no funding, they take on odd jobs to self-finance an ambitious project - creating an emotionally intelligent humanoid robot named A106. Success comes when A106 is built and activated, fully capable of dynamic thought and feeling. Tenma and Ochanomizu now face profound questions about their creation. Will A106 be a godlike figure presiding over humanity? Or a compassionate friend working alongside them? The decisions made in these formative days will ripple through history, shaping the destiny of this powerful new lifeform. This previously untold origin story follows the breakthroughs and dilemmas behind A106's 'birth'. It sets the stage for the rise of the iconic Astro Boy and the role robotics will play in Japan's future. More than inventing new technology, Tenma and Ochanomizu are exploring the very essence of sentience itself.",
