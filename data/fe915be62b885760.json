    "text": "Biblia Koshodou no Jiken Techou follows Shinokawa Shioriko, the young and shy owner of the Biblia Antiquarian Bookshop in Kamakura. Though timid with customers, Shioriko possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of literature. When Daisuke, a young man with a lifelong aversion to reading, inherits a complete collection of autographed works by famed Meiji-era writer Natsume Soseki, he brings them to Shioriko's shop. Sensing mystery and intrigue within the pages, Shioriko teams up with her lanky assistant Goura to unravel the books' secrets. Together, they discover hidden meanings and solve age-old puzzles to help various customers who visit the shop looking for answers. Though the true solutions always surprise, Shioriko's logic and passion for the written word never fail to uncover the truth behind these antiquarian tales.",
