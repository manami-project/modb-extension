    "text": "Nakajima Youko seems like an ordinary high school student, but she struggles with frequent nightmares and feeling like an outcast due to her bright red hair. Her life is turned upside down when a man named Keiki appears, kneels before her, and swears his allegiance while calling her his empress. Suddenly, Youko and two of her classmates, Yuka and Ikuya, are attacked by demonic creatures and transported to a mystical world ruled by twelve kingdoms. There, they are separated from Keiki and realize they are unwelcome outsiders in this dangerous land filled with magic, mystical beasts, and scheming immortals. Now on their own, Youko and her friends must learn to survive while searching for Keiki in hopes that he can help them find a way home. Along the way, they stumble into trouble with some of the locals. Youko starts to wonder if she has a greater destiny tied to this world. Will she be able to fulfill it and protect her friends? Or will the perils of this treacherous new world prove too much for them?",
