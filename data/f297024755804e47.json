Each time, her life resets at the moment her engagement is broken off. With a history of living as a merchant, a doctor, a maid, and even a knight, Rishe yearns for a peaceful, uneventful life. However, her plans take an unexpected turn when she encounters Arnold Hein, the notorious crown prince of a rival kingdom. Arnold, who was responsible for Rishe's death in a previous life, surprisingly proposes to her. To prevent a looming war and secure her desired tranquil life, Rishe must navigate her seventh reincarnation as the bride of an enemy nation's crown prince, using her past experiences to guide her. Will Rishe finally achieve her dream of a serene life, or will fate have other plans? Join Rishe on her extraordinary journey as she strives to break free from her time loop and live the life she's always desired.",
