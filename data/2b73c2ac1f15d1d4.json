    "text": "Kujo Jotaro, a popular Japanese high school student, finds his life upended when he discovers that the 'spirit' possessing him is actually a manifestation of his fighting energy, known as a 'Stand.' Meanwhile, the centuries-old feud between the Joestar family and the vampire Dio Brando reignites as Dio is revived from his watery grave.\n\nAs Dio's resurrection awakens the latent Stand powers in Jotaro and his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, they embark on a mission to gather allies with similar abilities, each marked by a unique Tarot card symbol. The stakes are high as Jotaro's mother, Holly, falls ill due to Dio's curse, making their journey to Egypt to confront Dio a race against time.\n\nIn this thrilling prequel, the Joestar family's generational battle against Dio reaches new heights as they harness their newfound powers and rally a team of Stand users to save Holly and put an end to Dio's reign of terror once and for all.",
