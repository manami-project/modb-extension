  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nue to a distant future, where the world is dominated by diverse tribes and populated by both humans and intelligent monsters. The tyrannical Evil King Genma, ruler of the Mah tribe, is determined to sire a powerful heir and sets his sights on a human woman from the Hito tribe. To protect her village from the menacing Ape Clan raiders, a brave woman named Non agrees to bear Genma's child. She gives birth to twin boys, Loof and Jin, but the ungrateful villagers exile them.\n\nAs part of the arrangement, Loof is taken to be raised by his father, Genma, while Jin remains with Non. However, Loof's life is far from easy, as the Evil King's queen, Parome, harbors a deep hatred for humans, causing her animosity towards Loof to grow. Meanwhile, Jin is raised among the Hito tribe, blissfully unaware of his brother's struggles.\n\nDespite being raised in the Mah tribe, Loof fails to develop the magical abilities his tribe desires, and as he grows older, he is ultimately cast out. As fate would have it, the lives of the twin brothers become intertwined once more, setting the stage for a series of fateful events that will determine their destiny and the future of their respective tribes.",
