    "text": "Both Lina Inverse and Naga the White Snake, two renowned sorceresses, stumble upon a peculiar town ruled by two feuding barons. While exploring the city, they rescue a young girl, Laia Einburg, from a rampaging bull golem. The girl's father, Galia, is a legendary golem craftsman, and her brother, Huey, is an aspiring one. Both father and son have been at odds due to their contrasting golem-making styles.\n\nLina and Naga, enticed by Galia's reputation, hope to acquire a golem for profit. However, Galia has been on a hiatus from crafting golems, preoccupied with his feud with Huey. When the barons commission father and son to create golems for a duel to determine the town's leadership, Galia and Huey see an opportunity to settle their own score.\n\nLina and Naga find themselves unwittingly entangled in the conflict, serving as the inspiration for the golems. As the duel approaches, the sorceresses must navigate the escalating tensions and unpredictable alliances in this golem-crafting showdown. Will they emerge victorious or become casualties of the town's power struggle? Only time will tell in this thrilling and comedic adventure.",
