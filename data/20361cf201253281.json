  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime presents a unique blend in the form of 'Kara no Kyoukai Remix-Gate of seventh heaven-', a remix work that precedes the final 7th movie. Released in theaters on March 14, 2009, this hour-long film offers a chronological rearrangement of key themes and pivotal scenes from the first six movies, commencing with the 2nd, followed by the 4th, 3rd, 1st, 5th, and 6th. While the majority of the content is familiar, viewers can also anticipate some fresh scenes interspersed throughout.\n\nIn a separate narrative, the story unfolds in August 1995 when Mikiya Kokutou, a typical student, encounters the enigmatic Shiki Ryougi, a young woman adorned in a kimono. Despite her unconventional background and peculiar demeanor, Mikiya is drawn to her and endeavors to establish a friendship. As Shiki gradually warms up to him, Mikiya's life takes an unexpected turn, forever altered by this seemingly ordinary encounter, revealing a darker side to his new acquaintance.",
