  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mio Fukatani attends her high school reunion eager to reconnect with her former classmate Takahide Kujou. She remembers Kujou as a kindhearted friend, though they were never romantically involved. At the reunion, Mio learns that Kujou has inherited his family's temple and become a Buddhist priest. Initially believing that priests remain celibate, Mio resigns herself to a platonic friendship with Kujou. However, after the two share some drinks, an unexpected passion ignites between them. Caught up in the heat of the moment, propriety gives way to desire. The next morning, clarity and doubts set in. Though undeniably attracted to one another, Mio questions if a physical relationship aligns with Kujou's spiritual calling. Where will this impulsive tryst lead them? Can forbidden love coexist with religious vows? The two long-lost classmates now face a complex personal and ethical dilemma.",
