  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hello!! Kinmoza follows the story of Shinobu, a high school girl who spent time abroad as a junior high student living with a host family in the UK. There she became close friends with a British girl named Alice. To Shinobu's delight, Alice ends up coming to study in Japan and live with her. As the new school year begins, Shinobu continues to pursue her interest in foreign languages along with her group of friends including Alice. However, they face some unexpected challenges. Alice and their friend Yoko struggle to adjust to being in different classes from Shinobu and their other friend Aya. Meanwhile, their friend Karen clashes with her new homeroom teacher, who herself has trouble connecting with the students. In the midst of these difficulties, crazy antics still ensue as the girls aim to have fun and grow closer together. For instance, Alice and Aya amusingly pretend to be juvenile delinquents in an effort to seem more mature. While some of their experiences are more chaotic than planned out, the heartwarming friendships continue to deepen. As the eventful school year unfolds, Shinobu and her endearing group of friends forge new adventures and find that shared experiences can bring people together across languages and cultures.",
