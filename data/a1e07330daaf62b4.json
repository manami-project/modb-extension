  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Together, we find ourselves in Tokyo, 2030, where an enigmatic high-frequency resonance echoes through the city, accompanied by a veil of crimson mist. The eerie sound renders all living beings unconscious, from humans to animals, leaving the once bustling metropolis in a state of suspended animation. The government, fearing the onset of an unknown virus, promptly relocates to Osaka, isolating Tokyo from the rest of the nation.\n\nSix days later, the city awakens as if from a dream, with no apparent aftereffects. Life begins to regain its rhythm, but beneath the surface, something has shifted. Strange occurrences begin to unfold, and the city finds itself entangled in a web of inexplicable events.\n\nMeanwhile, the city's youth begin to uncover latent powers hidden within their blood, revealing themselves as 'vessels of wisdom blood.' Drawn together by forces they cannot comprehend, they must navigate a labyrinth of fate, sacrificing their own lives to confront the mysterious chain of events unfolding around them.",
