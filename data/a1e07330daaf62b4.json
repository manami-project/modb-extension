    "text": "In the year 2030, a strange phenomenon strikes Tokyo. A high-frequency sound resonates across the city, accompanied by an eerie red fog. All who hear the sound - humans and animals alike - fall unconscious. Fearing a viral epidemic, the government blockades Tokyo and establishes emergency headquarters in Osaka. Six days later, those affected awake with no memory of what transpired. As Tokyo recovers, bizarre events plague the city. Some people discover latent psychic abilities triggered by the incident, manifesting powers through the blood in their veins. Drawn together by unseen forces, these individuals communicate and bond over their newfound gifts. However, their destinies soon intertwine in ominous ways. The group comes to realize the sound and fog were part of something bigger - a mystery that now pulls them into its depths. They must learn to control their awakened powers to challenge the approaching calamity. Though initially unaware of what set them on this course, the psychics uncover difficult truths about the fate waiting for them all. Their lives forever changed, they find themselves at the mercy of forces beyond their understanding.",
