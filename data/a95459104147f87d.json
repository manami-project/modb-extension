  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fumihiko is a marketing employee who gets stood up for a movie date. As he is about to throw away the tickets, he meets Aka, an aspiring voice actress who joins him for the movie instead. They discover they are neighbors, but soon after, Aka's apartment burns down. With nowhere to go, Fumihiko offers his place to stay. This leads to an intimate encounter, and afterwards they agree to live together platonically despite their one-night stand. As fate would have it, Aka lands the role of voice acting the mascot Fumihiko designed for his company's new product. While supportive of each other's careers, they struggle to keep their unusual living arrangement private to avoid scrutiny at work. As their bond deepens, so too do the challenges of maintaining a secret relationship under one roof. Will they manage to move forward both personally and professionally while hiding the truth?",
