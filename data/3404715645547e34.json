    "text": "In an alternate world, a top-secret weapon called Evangelion Unit-Null is undergoing activation testing when it suddenly breaks free from human control and goes on a rampage. This powerful war machine, developed in complete secrecy, threatens the safety of the entire world as all attempts to regain control fail. Suspicion grows over Unit-Null's intended purpose, leading some to question why it was created. This short film explores the chaos unleashed when a decisive weapon designed for unknown reasons escapes confinement during routine trials. Though many specifics remain a mystery, the threat posed sparks concern that more sinister motivations may lurk underneath the surface of Unit-Null's development.",
