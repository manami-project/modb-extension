By exploiting their deepest desires, she manages to kidnap them one by one, leaving the remaining Ronin Warriors to question their role in this unfolding drama. With their greatest wishes dangled before them like bait, can the warriors resist Suzunagi's allure and uncover the truth behind their armors and this ancient play?
