    "text": "Mekakucity V's compiles the music videos from the popular Kagerou Project song series. It features 13 songs in total - 10 that were previously released on DVD and 3 new bonus tracks. The songs follow the adventures of the 'Mekakushi-dan' or Blindfold Gang, a group of 9 teenagers with special powers. As we see in videos like 'Yuukei Yesterday', 'Outer Science', and 'Summer Time Record', each member has a unique story and struggles with controlling their abilities. The collection also includes the exclusive 'Shounen Brave' music video, made specifically for this DVD release. With its visually-striking high definition music videos and insights into the mysterious Blindfold Gang, Mekakucity V's is essential viewing for fans of the Kagerou Project multimedia franchise. Those new to the songs will also find an engaging entry point into this creative world and its memorable characters.",
