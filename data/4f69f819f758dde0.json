Enter Hayato Kisaragi, a young survivor of a Savage attack who has shown remarkable compatibility with the Hundred. To hone his skills and protect his ailing sister, Hayato enrolls at the prestigious Little Garden Naval Academy, a floating battleship that trains Slayers, the elite warriors skilled in wielding the Hundred.\n\nUpon his arrival, Hayato is thrust into a whirlwind of unexpected challenges. He is immediately drawn into a duel with Claire Harvey, the academy's most formidable Slayer, known as the Queen. Simultaneously, he grapples with an inexplicable sense of familiarity towards his roommate, Emil Crossford, whose feminine demeanor and mysterious knowledge of Hayato's past stir up a storm of questions. As Hayato navigates these challenges, he finds himself at the center of attention, attracting interest from various female peers while battling the Savages threatening Earth's safety.",
