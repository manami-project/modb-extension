  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On his first day at Wakame High School, timid transfer student Fujiyama 'Fuumin' Okometsubu sets out to make 100 new friends and start anew. However, his plans take a bizarre turn when he crosses paths with the enigmatic Hananakajima Masaru, a martial arts enthusiast rumored to have spent the past three months in the woods perfecting his unique style: Sexy Commando. Despite Masaru's eccentricities, Fuumin finds himself drawn into his world, becoming the first member of the newly-formed Sexy Commando Club.\n\nJoined by a motley crew of fellow students, including the manliness-obsessed Kondou Machahiko, the frail yet ambitious Isobe Tsuyoshi, and the mustache-loving Kitahara 'Moemoe' Tomoe, the Sexy Commando Club embarks on a series of peculiar adventures. From the Baseball Game of Honor to the Alien Camping Trip, these friends navigate the trials and tribulations of high school life with their unconventional martial arts at the forefront. As the club's popularity grows, they find themselves competing in the National Sexy Commando Tournament, where they must rely on their unique skills and unbreakable bond to emerge victorious.",
