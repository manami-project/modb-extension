  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mitsuba Kenichi, an average elementary school student, finds his life turned upside down when he crosses paths with Kanzo Hattori, a young ninja hailing from the Iga mountains. In an effort to perfect his ninja abilities, Hattori, along with his brother Shinzo and their ninja-dog Shishimaru, take up residence in Kenichi's home, bringing with them a whirlwind of ninja traditions and adventures. As Kenichi navigates this new reality, he discovers the extraordinary within the ordinary. In 2012, a remake of this beloved anime series, produced by Shin-Ei Animation and Reliance MediaWorks, began airing in India and Indonesia, marking a significant step in expanding the reach of popular anime series beyond Japan's stagnating domestic market.",
