  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chinese whispers speak of a raven-haired maiden, a warrior who has sworn to protect the innocent from the clutches of ruthless bandits. After witnessing the brutal murder of her family, this enigmatic heroine, known as Kan'u Unchou, dedicates her life to eradicating such malevolent forces. As her exploits spread like wildfire, she remains an elusive figure, her identity cloaked in mystery.\n\nDuring her travels, Kan'u encounters a young girl, Chouhi Yokutoku, who shares a similar tragic past. United by their common loss, the two form an unbreakable bond and vow to bring peace to the land. Along their journey, they cross paths with a diverse group of individuals who are drawn to their cause, including the noble Chouun Shiryuu, the headstrong Bachou Mouki, and the cunning Shokatsuryou Koumei.\n\nInspired by the classic Chinese novel, Romance of the Three Kingdoms, this anime follows Kan'u and her companions as they confront local lords and marauding bandits, leaving a trail of hope in their wake. From political struggles to odd jobs, the group's adventures are as varied as they are dangerous. As they traverse the land, they strive to make life a little easier for those in need, forging a new path in a world that desperately needs heroes.",
