    "text": "Punch Line follows the adventures of Yuuta Iridatsu, a high school student with an unusual affliction - whenever he sees female underwear, he faints with excitement. After Yuuta's soul is separated from his body during a bus hijacking, he finds himself wandering around as a spirit. Yuuta takes up residence in an apartment building called Korai House, inhabited by a lively group including genius inventor Meika, popular idol Mikatan, shut-in NEET Ito, spiritualist Rabura, and more. As Yuuta plays tricks on the residents unseen, he's taken under the wing of a perverted ghost cat named Chiranosuke. Chiranosuke reveals an alarming secret - if Yuuta sees panties in his spiritual form, he gains tremendous power, but risks destroying the Earth with an asteroid strike. With the apocalypse hanging by a thread, Yuuta races to regain his body and save the planet. But sinister forces also seek the secrets of Korai House for their own gain. As underwear-induced chaos unfolds, the fate of the world depends on whether Yuuta can control his panty obsession long enough to unlock the mysteries surrounding him and his eclectic neighbors.",
