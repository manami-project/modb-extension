    "text": "Now here girl Yuna Kagurazaka transforms into the cosmic champion, the Savior of Light, after winning an intergalactic contest for her pure heart. Piloting the mighty mecha El Line, Yuna defends the universe from threats—until she's falsely accused of destroying her own city. Abducted by the Galaxy Alliance's special agent Misaki, Yuna's fate takes a turn when Misaki uncovers the truth and joins forces with Yuna's friends to free her and thwart an impending evil force. With the help of her cyborg pal Yuri and the enigmatic Polylina, Yuna must clear her name and continue her mission to safeguard the galaxy. Balancing her high school life and her cosmic crusade, Yuna's days are filled with culinary contests, battling evil foes, and preventing the sinister Fraulein D from seizing power—all with a dash of humor and a whole lot of heart.",
