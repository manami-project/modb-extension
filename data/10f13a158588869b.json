  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Film degradation and a valiant cowboy's rescue mission collide in this unique take on classic American western animation. In \"Broken Down Film,\" our bumbling yet determined hero navigates through the challenges of a deteriorating film reel, complete with misaligned frames and smudged visuals. As he battles a menacing, moustached villain to save his damsel in distress, the cowboy must also contend with the physical decay of the film itself. This unconventional short film pays tribute to the silent comedy era, where heroes often found themselves saving royals or beauties tied to railroad tracks, all while adding a fresh twist through its intentional display of aged film artifacts.",
