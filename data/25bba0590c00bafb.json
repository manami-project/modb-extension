After narrowly escaping an assassination attempt, Arslan flees the capital with his loyal general Daryun. Hunted by enemies, they slowly gather allies to their cause. We witness Arslan's growth from a sheltered prince to a budding leader. Though inexperienced, his courage and compassion inspire loyalty in his followers. Their trials forge strong bonds of friendship and purpose. After many hard-fought battles and narrow escapes from relentless foes, their band of warriors manages to find refuge in the fortress of Peshawar. However, greater challenges still lie ahead on the long road to free Arslan's nation from tyranny. This is a tale of a prince coming of age in a time of crisis. Around every corner lurks betrayal and bloodshed, but also hope - hope for freedom and a righteous new order.",
