    "text": "Yuko Yoshida's life takes a dramatic turn when she wakes up one day with horns and a tail, discovering she's a descendant of the Dark Clan, sworn enemies of the magical girls from the Light Clan. Her mission, given by her ancestor Lilith, is to defeat Momo Chiyoda, a magical girl from the Light Clan who, coincidentally, attends the same school as Yuko. However, Yuko's new role as the Shadow Mistress Yuko is not as glamorous as it sounds. She struggles with her new powers, losing her first duel against Momo, and even finding herself in need of Momo's help on several occasions. Despite this, Yuko is determined to fulfill her destiny and restore her family's power, even if it means facing off against the kind-hearted Momo. But as Momo seems to grow weaker with each encounter, Yuko finds herself questioning her role and the strange connection between them. Join Yuko in \"The Demon Girl Next Door\" as she navigates her new life filled with magical battles, unexpected friendships, and all-you-can-eat pancakes.",
