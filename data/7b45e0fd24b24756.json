  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuko Yoshida is an ordinary high school girl until one day she awakens her dormant demonic powers and transforms into Shadow Mistress Yuuko. She sprouts horns and a tail and is tasked by her ancestor Lilith to defeat Momo Chiyoda, a magical girl from the rival Light Clan. Yuuko attends the same high school as Momo. When she first challenges Momo to a duel, Yuuko loses badly due to her lack of strength and self-doubt about being a devil. Since then, she has continued relying on Momo's help regularly, while also unintentionally draining Momo's power. Despite being on opposing sides, Yuuko and Momo have developed an unexpected friendship. Yuuko grapples with her role as a devil and the mission to disturb the peace in Tama City. The contrast between Yuuko's demonic appearance and her harmless personality creates ironic humor. Ultimately, Yuuko must find a way to balance her family duty with her growing camaraderie with Momo.",
