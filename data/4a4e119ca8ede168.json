  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Of the intriguing world where humans and human-animal hybrids coexist, Hiroshi Inaba stands out as a unique private investigator. Being part-wolf, Inaba possesses an extraordinary ability to extract crucial information from a mere strand of hair. As the head of the Inaba Detective Agency, he is often called upon to solve cases that leave the police baffled due to the non-human clues left behind by half-human criminals.\n\nInaba's most formidable adversary is Don Valentino, a half-goat mafia boss with an insatiable appetite for money. Inaba is determined to bring Valentino to justice, but doing so requires navigating through a complex web of evidence. Aiding him in his quest are his two assistants: Yuuta, a cross-dressing secretary, and Kei, a relatively normal teenager.\n\nInaba's methods may be unconventional, but his dogged determination and keen senses make him a force to be reckoned with. As he closes in on Valentino and his criminal empire, the stage is set for a thrilling showdown between the lone wolf detective and the greenback-gobbling crime boss. Will Inaba's unique abilities and relentless pursuit be enough to put the 'baaaad' guys behind bars?",
