    "text": "Que ue the rise of an unlikely duo in the world of music! Meet Hu Li, a high school student with a golden voice, but a face concealed behind a fox mask due to a disfiguring traffic accident. Pronounced similarly to the Chinese term for 'fox', Hu Li is the secret talent behind the popular yet vocally-challenged idol, Kong Que, whose name echoes the Chinese word for 'peacock'.\n\nWith his dreams of becoming a world-renowned singer, Hu Li finds himself not under the spotlight, but hidden in a recording studio, lending his voice to the handsome yet narcissistic Kong Que. Despite his financial struggles and lack of conventional attractiveness, Hu Li's musical journey takes a digital turn as he shares his melodies online under the pseudonym 'Mr. Fox'.\n\nAs they navigate the tumultuous entertainment industry, the pair face rivalries and internal conflicts, all while climbing the ladder of fame. Will Hu Li's dream ever transcend the confines of his fox mask and reach the global stage? Only time will tell in this captivating tale of ambition, music, and identity.",
