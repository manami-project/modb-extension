That's exactly what happens to Tyson and the Bladebreakers, winners of the Japanese Beyblade Championship, as they set out for some rest and relaxation at their teacher's beach house. However, their tranquil getaway is disrupted by Daichi, a boy eager for a rematch against Tyson after his defeat in the Beyblade World Championships.\n\nBefore they can even settle the score, the mysterious Shadow Bladers emerge, kidnapping Daichi and seizing his rare Beyblade, Strata Dragoon. These malevolent spirits, once sealed away, now seek to harness Strata Dragoon's power to unleash their dark forces and wreak havoc upon the world.\n\nWith Daichi under their control and the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Tyson, Max, Ray, and Kai must rise to the challenge. They must outwit these powerful adversaries, rescue Daichi, and thwart the Shadow Bladers' sinister plans before it's too late. Will our heroes prevail, or will the world succumb to darkness?
