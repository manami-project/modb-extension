  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Get ready for a wild ride at Hekiyou Academy, where the student council is anything but ordinary! Led by the sweet-toothed President Kurimu, who often shirks her duties, and the cunning secretary Chizuru, who expertly pulls the strings, this group is a far cry from your typical student government. Add in the otaku Mafuyu, who's always penning online guides and fending off the advances of Ken, the sole male member and self-proclaimed eroge enthusiast, and you've got a recipe for chaos. Luckily for Mafuyu, her athletic and tomboyish sister Minatsu is there to keep Ken at bay. Together, these five engage in a constant battle against monotony, filling their days with otaku references and squabbles with the journalism club. Despite Ken's dreams of a harem lifestyle, the council's focus remains on organizing school events and managing other clubs, much to his dismay. But that won't stop him from pursuing his outrageous ambitions, even if they seem a bit far-fetched! Brace yourself for a whirlwind of fourth wall breaks, parodies, and even a few cameos in Seitokai no Ichizon!",
