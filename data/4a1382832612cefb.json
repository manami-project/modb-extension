  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hekiyo Academy has a unique student council selection process - members are voted in based on popularity, resulting in a council comprised almost entirely of girls. The sole exception is Ken Sugisaki, a boy who studied relentlessly and improved his mediocre grades just enough to score the top exam result and secure the final council spot. Once part of the council, Ken discovers the group doesn't take their responsibilities too seriously. President Kurimu Sakurano loves snacks more than student affairs. Secretary Chizuru Sasaki manipulates those around her with ease. Otaku Mafuyu Shiina focuses on crafting online walkthroughs over council tasks. And tomboy Minatsu Shiina spends more time playing sports than managing school clubs. The self-proclaimed harem dreamer Ken remains determined to win the girls' affection, though his advances only annoy them. Together, the eccentric group bumbles through student council meetings, constantly breaking the fourth wall with otaku references and parodying popular anime tropes. Their days are never boring as they halfheartedly organize school events while battling the journalism club and struggling to combat their own boredom.",
