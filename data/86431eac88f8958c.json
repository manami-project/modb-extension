    "text": "Insectors, a swarm of malevolent insects, threaten the Inner World, a hidden realm nestled within the Earth's core. To protect this mysterious land, the Spider Riders, a group of valiant warriors, join forces with giant spiders to fend off the relentless invaders. When 11-year-old Hunter Steele stumbles upon a portal to this subterranean world, he becomes entwined in their struggle.\n\nAs he navigates the enigmatic Inner World, Hunter encounters Shadow, a colossal spider with whom he forms a powerful bond. Together, they join the Spider Riders in their quest to restore the Oracle's powers and save their world from the clutches of Mantid, the ruthless Insecter leader.\n\nGuided by his grandfather's journal and a newfound ally, Corona, Hunter embarks on a perilous journey to retrieve the four Oracle Keys that will unlock the Oracle's true might. With the fate of the Inner World hanging in the balance, Hunter must harness his courage and embrace his destiny as a Spider Rider. But as an ancient prophecy looms, will Hunter become the savior they need, or will he unintentionally bring about their doom?",
