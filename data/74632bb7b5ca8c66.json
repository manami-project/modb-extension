  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jing'Shippo', Daichi Sumeragi, and the reigning Beyblade champion, Tyson, set the stage for a thrilling new chapter in the world of Beyblade. After Tyson's back-to-back world championship victories, the Bladebreakers disband, with Max, Ray, and Kai seeking individual growth and the chance to dethrone Tyson. As they embark on separate journeys filled with intense battles and formidable adversaries, Tyson and Kenny welcome the tenacious Daichi to their ranks.\n\nThe Beyblade scene undergoes a significant transformation when the upcoming world tournament introduces a tag-team rule, forcing the Bladebreakers to face off against each other in their quest for supremacy. As the competition unfolds, an old nemesis, Boris, seizes control of the Beyblade Battle Association, reshaping it into the nefarious Beyblade Entertainment Global Association (BEGA).\n\nWith the purity of Beyblading at stake, the Bladebreakers must put aside their differences and unite to challenge BEGA's corruption. Tyson, now a mentor to aspiring Beybladers, must balance his teaching responsibilities with his desire to maintain his championship status. As friendships are tested and alliances are forged, the Bladebreakers brace themselves for the ultimate battle to protect the spirit of Beyblading.",
