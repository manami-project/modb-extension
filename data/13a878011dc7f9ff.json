    "text": "League of Villains may have left a deep scar, but the students of UA Academy are ready to face their next hurdle: the prestigious UA Sports Festival. This event, akin to a tournament, is a platform for Japan's budding heroes to showcase their unique abilities, or \"quirks,\" to the media and potential employers. For Izuku Midoriya, who struggles to control his quirk, this festival is a chance to prove his mettle. As classes from Hero to Support, General to Business participate, the competition heats up. Who will emerge as the top hero in training? In a world where being \"quirkless\" is the norm for only a few, Izuku's journey at one of the world's most esteemed hero academies is a testament to his unyielding spirit and determination. Will he be able to turn his dreams into reality? Only time will tell.",
