    "text": "In a world where most people have superpowers known as \"quirks,\" a young boy named Izuku Midoriya dreams of becoming a professional superhero, even though he does not have a quirk himself. He enrolls in U.A. Academy, an elite school for aspiring heroes, where his class is preparing to compete in the high-profile U.A. Sports Festival tournament. This tournament serves as a showcase where the students can demonstrate their quirks and abilities to the public and potential sponsors. It is an important opportunity for Izuku and his talented classmates like Shouto Todoroki, who can control fire and ice. However, having an ineffective superpower, Izuku faces an uphill battle against his skilled peers. Utilizing his sharp wits and creativity, Izuku aims to overcome the limitations of his quirk and prevail against formidable opponents. His goal is to prove to the world that he has what it takes to become a hero, despite originally being born quirkless. The sports festival pushes Izuku and his classmates to their limits as they compete for glory.",
