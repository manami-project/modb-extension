    "text": "Sasaki Haise, formerly known as Kaneki Ken, has rediscovered his lost memories, leaving him torn in the ongoing battle between humans and ghouls. Emulating his mentor Arima, Kaneki takes on the responsibility of interrogating Eto, the One-Eyed Owl, after her public revelation as a ghoul during a press conference for her latest book, which she believes will unite the two factions. Imprisoned in Cochlea, Eto eagerly anticipates the emergence of the 'One-Eyed King', but only Kaneki appears to grasp her true intentions. As Aogiri Tree launches an assault on the facility to save their leader, Kaneki enlists the help of an old ally for his covert mission. Meanwhile, the Commission of Counter Ghouls (CCG) continues to grow in power, aiming to eradicate every ghoul in Japan, even as whispers of corruption begin to surface within the organization. Amidst this turmoil, the Quinx Squad, led by Haise, must confront their inner struggles and carry out their duties to the CCG. The stage is set for a thrilling confrontation as Tokyo Ghoul:re continues to unfold.",
