  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Haruka, Kana, and Chiaki, the Minami sisters, have matured over the past year, yet their personalities remain delightfully familiar. Haruka, the eldest, is a nurturing and disciplined maternal figure to her younger siblings, while Kana, the middle sister, is a procrastinator who often stirs up trouble for the trio. Chiaki, the youngest, is a cunning and manipulative sibling who craves admiration and love from Haruka, and often creates mischief for Kana. Despite their quirks and differences, the sisters share a deep bond and love for one another.\n\nAs the family navigates through the challenges of daily life, love and laughter are constant companions. Haruka, now a young adult, faces increased responsibilities while balancing her role as a caretaker and adjusting to her newfound adult life. Their apartment serves as a gathering spot for friends and their sensitive uncle, ensuring that the sisters are never short of company or entertainment.\n\nFrom pondering new year's fortunes to debating moral dilemmas, no topic is off-limits for the Minami sisters. As they continue to grow and face new challenges, one thing remains certain: there will always be room for one more under the kotatsu in this loving and unconventional family.",
