    "text": "There exists a secluded, diminutive island, nestled beyond the vast expanse of the sea, teeming with peculiar creatures hitherto undiscovered by mankind. Among these unique beings are Paroru, Zuzu, and Rikotto, who, despite their initial apprehensions about the hazards of the world beyond their island, harbor an insatiable curiosity for the human realm. This fascination is ignited by the discovery of a captivating photograph of the human world.\n\nDefying the established rules, the trio embarks on a daring expedition, constructing a makeshift boat to traverse the open sea. Upon their arrival, they are initially captivated by the breathtaking beauty and allure of this foreign land. However, their excitement is short-lived as they are soon confronted with the daunting challenges of navigating a bustling human city.\n\nTheir adventure takes a perilous turn when Rikotto and Zuzu are ensnared by a cunning circus ringleader, intent on showcasing the duo as spectacles for human amusement. Faced with this formidable threat, Paroru is compelled to confront his deepest fears to rescue his cherished friends.\n\nThis enchanting tale is one of the four 2014 Anime Mirai films, a project funded by the Japanese government's Agency of Cultural Affairs, dedicated to nurturing and training aspiring animators.",
