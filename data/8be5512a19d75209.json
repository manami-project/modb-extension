    "text": "The daring and fearless Mitsuki Hayami, who affectionately refers to herself as Micchi, embarks on a thrilling journey through the cosmos in her distinctive pink spacecraft, Pink Shock, at the tender age of 17. Her mission? To find her childhood companion who was taken by extraterrestrial beings when she was just four years old. Disregarding rules and boundaries, Micchi's reckless space adventures cause chaos and mayhem, even leading to a death sentence. Yet, her audacious exploits also earn her a devoted fan base. Enter Captain Gatsby, a misogynist assigned to halt Pink Shock's lawless escapades. However, as the story unfolds, he unexpectedly uncovers a shared connection with Micchi. This one-shot anime is a condensed adaptation of the original source material, chronicling Micchi's relentless pursuit to reconnect with her lost love.",
