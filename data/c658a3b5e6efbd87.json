  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Selectorsâ€”players whose memories are now represented by gold coins and must battle other Selectors to earn five of them. Guided by their LRIG avatar cards, which are created from the user's memories, the two learn that inconsistently partaking in duels or losing all their coins will result in a grim outcome. Resolved to protect what they hold dear, Suzuko and Chinatsu prepare for the battles ahead and fight for the chance to reclaim themselves.\n\nHigh school student Homura Suzuko returns to her childhood hometown of Ikebukuro, eager to reconnect with her old friend Morikawa Chinatsu. However, she struggles to fit in at school and turns to the popular card game WIXOSS as a way to make friends. When she opens her newly purchased deck set, a card comes to life and welcomes her as a Selector. Selectors must battle for control of five coins that hold all their memories, with the winner able to leave the game and the loser facing dire consequences. As Suzuko navigates this dangerous game, she discovers that Chinatsu has also been drawn into the world of WIXOSS. Will the two former friends be able to reunite and emerge victorious, or will they fall victim to the game's cruel penalties?",
