  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Homura Suzuko returns to her childhood hometown of Ikebukuro, looking forward to reconnecting with her treasured friend Morikawa Chinatsu. However, Suzuko struggles to fit in at her new high school. In an attempt to make friends, she starts playing the popular card game WIXOSS. But this is no ordinary game - the cards are imbued with fragments of players' memories and personalities. Suzuko soon discovers that she has become a \"Selector\", fated to battle other Selectors. The rules are ruthless: winners claim coins representing memories, but losers face a mysterious penalty called \"Lostorage\". Meanwhile, Chinatsu is also drawn into the dark game while working to support her family. With their memories and fates now intertwined with WIXOSS, the two former friends must fight their way through unpredictable battles. Will they regain what they have lost? Or will the game demand a greater price for its gift of power? This anime explores the bonds of friendship and the steep cost of desire.",
