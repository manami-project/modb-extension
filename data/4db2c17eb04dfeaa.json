  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Issei Hyodo is a perverted high school student whose dream is to have his own harem. His luck changes when he goes on a date with a girl named Yuuma, who turns out to be a fallen angel. She kills Issei, but he is then revived by his senpai Rias Gremory, who reveals herself as a devil. Rias recruits Issei into her Occult Research Club, which is full of other devils. Issei must now train to survive the violent world of angels and devils. He slowly adjusts to his new devil life, which leads to hilarious and risqu√© situations with his new comrades. However, he must keep his new identity a secret from his human friends and family. Issei finds himself amidst a chess game between devils, fallen angels, and exorcists. His friends' fates hang in the balance. Though initially weak compared to the beautiful female devils, this second chance at life gives Issei ample room to grow in strength and fulfill his dream of building a harem.",
