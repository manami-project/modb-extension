  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kuchiki and Kurosaki, two Soul Reapers stationed in Karakura Town, are accustomed to battling Hollows, lost souls turned corrupt. But when an influx of strange, vacant spirits known as \"Blanks\" invade, they find themselves out of their depth. These Blanks, unlike Hollows, are immune to soul burial and seem to be empty of memories. As the pair struggles against these new foes, a mysterious Soul Reaper named Senna appears, effortlessly fending off the Blanks. Meanwhile, a mirage of the human world materializes over Soul Society, further complicating matters. As Ichigo and Rukia grapple with these strange occurrences, they become entangled with Ganryuu, the leader of a rogue Soul Reaper group known as the Dark Ones, who has his sights set on Senna for his own nefarious plans. Can Ichigo and Rukia unravel the mystery behind Senna's identity and the sudden appearance of the Blanks before it's too late?",
