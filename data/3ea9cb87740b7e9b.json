    "text": "Upon starting high school, Tamaki Honda joins the peculiar SNS Club, a group focused on creating self-published doujin games. Though new to game development, Tamaki's passion for illustration and creativity leads her to become the club's artist. She joins fellow first-year Shiina, the skilled but eccentric programmer, Ayame, the imaginative writer with a penchant for romantic scenes, and Kayo, the talented composer. Together, the four girls race against tight deadlines to complete their first original doujin game for upcoming conventions. Tamaki embraces the world of doujin development as she learns to collaborate with her new friends' quirky personalities. Fueled by their creative spirits, the SNS Club passionately strives to successfully finish and showcase their ambitious project.
