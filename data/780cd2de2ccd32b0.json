    "text": "Gorou Honda, a six-year-old with a passion for baseball, idolizes his father, Shigeharu, a professional baseball player in the Nippon League. Despite his father's demotion to the second-string team, Blue Ocean, and a subsequent elbow injury that forces him to switch from pitching to batting, Gorou's admiration never wavers. Inspired by his son's unwavering faith, Shigeharu perseveres, fueling Gorou's dream to excel in the Japanese Little League.\n\nGorou's life takes a turn when he meets Toshiya Satou, a neighbor who shares his love for baseball. Together, they train hard, with Gorou honing his pitching skills. Meanwhile, Momoko Hoshino, Gorou's preschool teacher, becomes an integral part of the Honda family, offering support and care.\n\nHowever, life throws them a curveball in the form of an unimaginable tragedy. Despite the hardships, the trio—Gorou, Shigeharu, and Momoko—must rally together, drawing strength from each other to overcome their challenges and continue their pursuit of their baseball dreams.",
