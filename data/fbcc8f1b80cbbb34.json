  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Both the pitcher, Haruka Kiyomine, and the catcher, Kei Kaname, known as the \"Skilled General,\" were once an unstoppable force in middle school baseball, leaving their opponents in the dust. Despite being scouted by prestigious sports schools, they end up at the ordinary Kotesashi High School in Tokyo due to Kei's sudden amnesia, which has caused his athletic abilities to decline. Coincidentally, other talented players who had previously lost to the duo and abandoned baseball also attend the same school. Together, they establish a new baseball club, reigniting their passion for the sport and beginning their high school baseball journey. With a mix of humor, competition, and the challenge of overcoming Kei's memory loss, this anime promises an exciting and entertaining experience.",
