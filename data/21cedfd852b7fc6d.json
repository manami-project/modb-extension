  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Animal Yokocho, a realm of whimsical and peculiar creatures, intersects with the world of a young, rational 5-year-old girl named Ami-chan through a secret door in her bedroom floor. Upon moving into her new home, Ami-chan encounters three talking animals: Issa, a gentle and naive panda; Kenta, an anxious bear with a penchant for red scarves and feigning toughness; and Iyo, a self-centered rabbit prioritizing her own well-being and pleasure. Initially hesitant, Ami-chan soon befriends the trio and embraces their daily escapades, which often involve twisted versions of seemingly innocent games. However, these AniYoko-style activities frequently prove to be illogical and perilous for Ami-chan, adding an unexpected layer of chaos and excitement to her life. As more mysterious characters from Animal Yokocho make their appearances, Ami-chan's secret adventures with her newfound friends continue to unfold.",
