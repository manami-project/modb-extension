    "text": "Internet and AI technology have reached unprecedented heights in 2045, making space travel accessible to all. In this advanced era, a group of young explorers find themselves stranded on the Japanese-built space station, Anshin, after an unforeseen celestial collision threatens their safety. Among them are Mina, Taiyou, and Hiroshi, three Earth-born children who won a space adventure competition, and Touya and Konoha, the last two lunar-born \"moon children.\"\n\nAs the space station faces imminent danger, these five young pioneers must rely on their wits, narrowband communication, social networking, and low-intelligence AI-controlled drones to navigate the treacherous challenges that await them. Their future hinges on the enigmatic Seven Poem, which holds the key to their survival and the fate of humanity itself. Will they manage to avert the impending catastrophe and save not only themselves but also the world they once called home? Join these brave youngsters as they embark on a thrilling and perilous journey in the vast expanse of space.",
