    "text": "When a mother goat manages to rescue her young from the belly of a ravenous wolf, her relief turns to dread as she realizes her eldest, Toruku, is still missing. As she searches fretfully for her son, Toruku himself grapples with internal turmoil over abandoning his siblings to the wolf. Eventually returning home, Toruku must confront not only his mother's desperate worry, but also the grisly remains of the siblings he left behind. Just as tensions peak, the wolf reappears, now threatening the remaining flock. In their panicked preparations for its attack, the truth about Toruku's disappearance comes flooding back. Survival now depends on setting aside past betrayals to stand united against their common foe. This suspenseful tale explores the complex bonds of family through the eyes of a goat herd fighting for their lives. As predators circle, they must weigh their prejudices against the necessity of cooperation. Can unconditional love overcome even the most heartbreaking acts of cowardice? Their ultimate choice could secure safety or spell disaster for goat and wolf alike.",
