  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While the Galactic Union of Worlds debates the eligibility of Earth to join their ranks, Prince Planet, a Universal Peace Corps member from the planet Radion, is sent on a mission to Earth. His task: to assess Earth's readiness for membership and instill peace and order among its inhabitants.\n\nDisguised as a normal Earth boy named Bobby, Prince Planet finds a home on a ranch with Diana Worthy and her father, Pops. Diana, equipped with a special ring, can summon Prince Planet when danger arises. The main city of Metropol serves as the backdrop for Prince Planet's adventures as he combats evil forces, both earthly and extraterrestrial.\n\nPrince Planet's extraordinary abilities are powered by a pendant that draws energy from a nuclear energy center on Radion. When transformed into his superhero form, he calls out \"Peeeeee Pazow!\" However, his pendant's energy often runs low during crucial battles, leaving him weakened until the operators at the energy center recharge it just in time.\n\nAs Bobby, Prince Planet experiences the emotions and desires of a normal Earth boy, including homesickness for his family on Radion. Despite these challenges, Prince Planet remains committed to his mission, using his pendant's various functions to fight evil and promote peace on Earth.",
