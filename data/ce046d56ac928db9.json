    "text": "America decides to host a Halloween party and invite all the other countries. Knowing America's penchant for the dramatic, he announces that there will be a costume contest with prizes. The competitive countries show up dressed elaborately, eager to outdo each other. However, as the night wears on, America has yet to reveal his own costume. The guests begin to wonder why he hasn't shown off his outfit for the contest he created. Meanwhile, England arrives late, unaware of the costume contest. Italy and Germany attend together, with their usual hilarious antics providing amusement amidst the escalating costume rivalry. What costume could America be hiding that he hasn't revealed all night? And will England devise something last-minute now that he knows about the contest? With tensions rising, this Halloween party may be headed for chaos...or laughs.",
