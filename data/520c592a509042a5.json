    "text": "After a ferocious battle, the legendary Build Divers team saved the Gunpla Battle Nexus Online (GBN) virtual world from danger. Two years later, GBN has implemented major upgrades, including realistic sensory feedback, making the game more immersive than ever. As GBN's popularity grows, new Divers enter with diverse motivations. Lonely mercenary Hiroto quests for purpose. Independent thrill-seeker Kazami constantly seeks new adventures and companions. The mysterious May plays Gunpla Battle relentlessly day and night. And shy novice Parviz yearns to join a team but lacks the courage to do so. Eventually, these solitary Divers cross paths and unite when a new threat emerges, leading them to Eldora - a mysterious parallel world where the GBN battles have real-life consequences. There, alongside their new allies, they confront an army of hostile artificial intelligence bent on attacking Earth. In this ultimate battle with the highest stakes imaginable, the team confronts shocking revelations that challenge everything they believed about GBN. Through determination and teamwork, the Build Divers must protect both worlds from catastrophe.",
