    "text": "Morisaki Yuuta is a shy high school student and member of the photography club whose life is turned upside down when he encounters Kusunose Hina, a clumsy yet endearing girl from the tennis club. Yuuta and Hina share a childhood connection that resurfaces after their fateful school corridor run-in. As they rekindle their old friendship, it becomes apparent that Yuuta has captured the attention of several girls around him. From past friends to new acquaintances, he finds himself struggling to navigate the onset of relationships and decipher his true feelings. Hina holds special meaning for Yuuta, tied to precious childhood memories with his late mother. There is an affectionate bond between them, but both are too reserved to express their budding romantic feelings. As Hina vies for Yuuta's attention against other admirers, she hopes he will accompany her to the upcoming Ocean Festival to enjoy fireworks and grow closer. Yet Yuuta's shy personality coupled with his popularity threatens to interfere. At its core, this is a sweet story of young love and friendship reborn. Will Yuuta and Hina find the courage to reveal their true emotions? Can their childhood promise blossom into something more? The outcome hangs delicately in the balance.",
