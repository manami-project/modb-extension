    "text": "Houraiji, Hiyuu, and their companions, known as the Magami Five, are on the brink of graduation, eagerly anticipating their future. Yet, peace in Tokyo remains elusive. A clandestine assassin group, the Twelve Heavenly Generals of the Martial Fist, shifts their focus from dispatching criminals beyond the law's reach to targeting the Magami Five. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Dancing Swords organization awakens latent powers in skilled fighters, transforming them into ruthless assassins. As these forces converge, the Magami Five must confront old friends turned foes and unravel the sinister motives behind this onslaught. Amidst the chaos, a shadowy figure orchestrates the carnage, aiming to annihilate Tokyo and awaken the Vessel of the Golden Dragon.\n\nSimultaneously, the group grapples with a resurgence of the undead and a looming threat of even more formidable demons. As exchange student Hiyuu and delinquent Houraiji lead the charge against these supernatural forces, they must also navigate the challenges posed by the Dancing Swords. With the city plagued by inexplicable murders and the organization targeting individuals with extraordinary abilities, the Magami Five's survival hangs in the balance. Can they unmask the puppet master and protect Tokyo from the impending doom?",
