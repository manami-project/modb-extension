  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Alicia is a young woman who is reincarnated as the villainess in her favorite otome video game. She has long despised the \"goody two-shoes\" heroines in stories and wishes to live as a true villainess. Now finding herself reborn into the game world as Alicia, the daughter of a noble family skilled in dark magic, she strives to play the role of villainess perfectly. With her jet-black hair, golden eyes and sharp tongue, Alicia has all the makings of a great antagonist. However, Alicia discovers her villainous efforts unexpectedly earn her popularity and admiration from the other characters, including the prince who takes an interest in her. The more evil she tries to act, the more people seem to like her! Frustrated by this unforeseen challenge, Alicia must determine whether she can succeed in making others hate her as a true villainess, or if she will end up loved despite her best efforts. Can Alicia overcome unexpected hurdles to secure her destiny as the most nefarious villainess in history? Or is a future at the prince's side one she cannot avoid? Her journey to discover the answer promises twists and surprises galore.",
