    "text": "Fox es with nine tails, known as Goomiho, were once feared for their ability to transform into humans by taking their souls. Driven into the mountains by hunters, these creatures vanished from human sight. However, a young five-tailed fox named Yobi still resides in the forest with her alien friends. When one of her companions is captured by a villager, Yobi is forced to venture into the human world to rescue him. Along the way, she meets Geum Yee, a student at a school for children with special mental abilities. Intrigued by Geum Yee, Yobi joins the students and begins to enjoy the human way of life. But danger lurks as a fox hunter and a mysterious shadow man are hot on her trail. As Yobi grows closer to Geum Yee, she must decide whether to take his spirit to become a real human, or to protect him and risk being hunted forever.",
