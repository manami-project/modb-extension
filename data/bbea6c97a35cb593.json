  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yobi, The Five Tailed Fox tells the story of a young five-tailed fox named Yobi who has lost her family to fox hunters and now lives in the forest with some aliens who have crash-landed on Earth. When one of her alien friends gets captured by a human villager, Yobi ventures into the human world to try and rescue him. There, she meets a boy named Geum Yee who attends a special school run by Teacher Kang that aims to strengthen students' mental abilities. As Yobi spends more time living amongst the humans and getting to know Geum Yee, she revels in the fun of human life. However, both a fox hunter and a mysterious shadow man are tracking Yobi with potentially sinister intentions. She finds herself facing an inevitable dilemma - whether to take Geum Yee's spirit to turn herself into a real human being, even though it would mean sacrificing his life. Throughout her journey, Yobi must evade those who want to harm her while also deciding if the only way she can truly experience humanity is by betraying the boy who has shown her kindness.",
