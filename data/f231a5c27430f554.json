  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fate/Grand Order is a popular mobile RPG game published by Type-Moon. Over the years, Type-Moon has released numerous animated commercials to promote the game and its various in-game events. These commercials feature unique animation sequences not seen in the main game. They introduce popular characters, tease upcoming story chapters, and highlight special crossover events with other Type-Moon properties. The very first Fate/Grand Order TV commercial aired in 2014. Since then, dozens more have been produced, often coinciding with major game updates. The lively spots advertise things like summer festivals, Christmas campaigns, and new story chapters set in wildly diverse locales. Though typically 30 seconds in length, some commercials have full version edits with additional content. The animated shorts are broadcast on Japanese television and also posted to Type-Moon's official YouTube channel. As a whole, these Fate/Grand Order commercials serve not only to advertise the mobile game, but also to creatively showcase the rich world and cast of characters that fans have come to love. With over 60 unique spots produced so far, they offer bite-sized animated adventures that both newcomers and longtime players can enjoy.",
