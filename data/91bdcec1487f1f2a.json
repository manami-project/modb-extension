  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yan Wushi, the cunning and ruthless leader of the Cleansing Moon sect, has walked a bloody path, leaving death and despair in his wake. He does not believe in the good nature of humanity. When he chances upon Shen Qiao, the virtuous chief disciple of the esteemed Mount Xuandu sect, who lies near death after being defeated by a rival clan, Yan Wushi hatches a sinister plot. He decides to nurture Shen Qiao back to health, all while manipulating him in hopes of one day molding him into a worthy adversary - one who has forsaken his benevolent beliefs and embraced a darker path of vengeance. Shen Qiao now finds his convictions tested at every turn. Thrust into a world of lies and betrayal that contrasts sharply with his once strong faith that good exists within everyone, he faces continuous hardships that push him to the brink. As Yan Wushi subjects him to deception after deception in an attempt to break his kind spirit, Shen Qiao grapples with the choice between upholding his benevolent nature despite the cruel reality he now sees, or giving in to Yan Wushi's nefarious scheme and becoming the vengeful cultivator that Yan Wushi aims to create.",
