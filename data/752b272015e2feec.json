  "synopsis": {
    "text": "An exoskeleton weapon system known as Infinite Stratos (IS) has revolutionized warfare and tipped the global balance of power, with one catch: only women can operate it. That is, until Ichika Orimura, a 15-year-old boy, is discovered to be the first male capable of piloting an IS. Thrust into the prestigious IS Academy by the Japanese government, Ichika finds himself in an all-female school filled with aspiring IS pilots from around the world. Among his new classmates is his childhood friend, Shinonono Houki. As Ichika navigates the challenges of his new life, he must learn to harness his unique abilities and protect his academy from potential threats, all while surrounded by a diverse group of talented and determined female pilots. With his legendary IS pilot sister, Chifuyu Orimura, as their homeroom teacher, Ichika and his friends embark on an exciting and unpredictable journey through their academy years.",
