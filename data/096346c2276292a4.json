  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so, in the eerie confines of a castle, the ambitious Dr. Victor Frankenstein embarks on a grotesque experiment to resurrect the dead, assisted by his loyal aide. Success comes in the form of a creature stitched together from scavenged body parts, but the outcome is far from what the doctor had envisioned. The being is volatile and terrifying, causing Frankenstein to abandon his creation and seek refuge in his Swiss home. Yet, as inexplicable killings begin to plague his newfound sanctuary, the doctor is forced to confront the chilling possibility that his monstrous creation may not be as extinct as he had hoped. This haunting tale, adapted from Mary Shelley's timeless classic, explores themes of misunderstanding and the grave errors humans often commit towards others.",
