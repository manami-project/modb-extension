Mitsurou, the new art teacher, is caught off guard by the forward advances of his colleague, Toshiaki. As they embark on a romantic journey together, Mitsurou grapples with his own feelings, wavering between acceptance and uncertainty.\n\nMeanwhile, external pressures mount as the school rector proposes a woman for Toshiaki, believing a traditional family would be beneficial for his career. Amidst this turmoil, Mitsurou's younger brother, Hitoshi, harbors feelings of jealousy, further complicating the situation.\n\nAs Mitsurou struggles to accept Toshiaki's open declaration of love and come to terms with his own feelings, he must also confront societal norms and expectations.
