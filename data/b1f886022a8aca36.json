  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mitsuro Kawase starts a new job as an art teacher, where he meets fellow teacher Toshiaki Kazama. Kazama openly pursues a romantic relationship with Kawase, who is unsure of his own feelings. Complicating matters is Kawase's younger brother Hitoshi, who seems a bit jealous, as well as the school administration that wants to introduce Kazama to a woman, hoping he will start a family. Kawase struggles with both internalized shame about a same-sex relationship as well as confusion over his budding feelings for Kazama. Kazama grows increasingly frustrated with Kawase's hesitation to reciprocate. When the prospect of an arranged marriage for Kazama arises, Kawase must confront his fears and decide if he can accept both Kazama's love and his own before their chance at happiness slips away. This is a romantic drama that explores the complex emotions and societal pressures facing two male teachers as they navigate a new same-sex relationship. Will Kawase find the courage to embrace love, or will he succumb to expectations? Can Kazama's passion break through Kawaseâ€™s uncertainty? This anime promises emotional highs and lows on the journey to resolve these questions.",
