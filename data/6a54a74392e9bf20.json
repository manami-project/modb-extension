    "text": "It's been fifteen years since the tragic sinking of the Daiichi Yachiyo Maru, a cargo ship that met its doom in the icy waters of the Pacific. Fast forward to the present day, Conan Edogawa, Ran Mouri, Kogorou Mouri, and their friends find themselves aboard the luxury liner St. Aphrodite, enjoying a much-needed vacation courtesy of Sonoko Suzuki's family. As they sail across the ocean, a sinister plot begins to unfold, with a series of murders and a mysterious connection to the ill-fated Daiichi Yachiyo Maru.\n\nAs the body count rises, it's up to Conan and Kogorou to unravel the tangled web of vengeance, deceit, and murder. But this time, it's Mori who takes center stage, proving his detective skills and challenging Conan's own deductions. As the ship's hull begins to fill with water, the race against time to catch the culprit and save the passengers intensifies. With no escape in sight, Conan and his friends must navigate the treacherous waters of this deadly mystery before they're pulled into its dark depths forever.",
