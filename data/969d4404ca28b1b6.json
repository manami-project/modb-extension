  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime centers around a boy in junior high school who enjoys photography and art. He likes to take photos of things that catch his interest and then create drawings based on the photos. As the story unfolds, he is walking his usual route home from school one day when he spots a girl he has romantic feelings for with another boy. This sight triggers an internal conflict within the protagonist between his delusions and ideals surrounding the girl and the reality of her interactions with someone else. His perspective and the balance between fantasy and truth seem prone to flux. As junior high school students on the cusp of adolescence, both the boy and girl are navigating new emotions and experiences that lead to both self-discovery and challenging interpersonal dynamics. Though details of the full storyline remain uncertain, the core premise suggests an exploration of middle school romance, personal growth, and managing one's understanding of reality during a transitional life stage. There is likely opportunity for relatable moments as well as meaningful character evolution over the course of the anime.",
