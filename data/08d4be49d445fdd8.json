    "text": "In a distant past, a prosperous civilization thrived thanks to the energy provided by titans called Luna. This abundant energy source, known as Mana, allowed the land to flourish. However, a catastrophic tsunami struck and wiped out this advanced society. Ten thousand years later, strange creatures awoke in the underground remains of this lost world. Mokugyo, a fish with lush plant life sprouting from his back, found himself alongside the talkative Toriiruka. Seeking answers, this unlikely duo set out to uncover what transpired in that fateful disaster so long ago. Along the way, they befriend other survivors, including the spiky yet gentle Harry and Yona, a descendant of the ancients tasked with restoring civilization. Though dangers await, Mokugyo and Toriiruka persist in their quest to safely return to the surface and unlock the mysteries buried in time. Will they uncover the truth about the destruction of the ancient land? Can this ragtag group of friends survive the threats of the modern subterranean world? Their curious adventure is only just beginning.",
