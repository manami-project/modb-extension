  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuri is a young man living in a countryside estate that has fallen on hard times. To help support the struggling household, his family hires a mysterious new maid named Lilith. From the moment she arrives, Lilith's skills seem almost supernatural - she keeps the manor spotless, cooks incredible meals, and anticipates Yuuri's every need. However, Yuuri grows suspicious of Lilith. She seems too perfect, and her striking purple eyes hint at secrets. He becomes convinced something sinister must be behind Lilith's competence. Yet as they spend more time together, an unusual bond slowly develops between the wary Yuuri and the kindly maid. This anime explores the relationship between the paranoid young master desperate to uncover the truth about Lilith and the charming maid hiding unnatural talents. Will Yuuri confirm his suspicions? Or will Lilith's warm personality break through his distrust? Their deepening rapport may lead to answers - and profound connections - neither expected.",
