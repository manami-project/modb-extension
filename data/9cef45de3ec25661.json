  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Himiko, a powerful warrior from the Kansai region, embarks on a quest to obtain sacred magatama beads worn by fighters in the Kanto region. This signals an end to the power struggle that has gripped the two regions. It is revealed that Himiko is actually the reincarnation of the former Queen of Yamatai. Seeking to recover her lost kingdom, she plans to gather three legendary Japanese treasures. To achieve this goal, Himiko and her ally Asaemon Yamada launch a ruthless attack on Nanyou Academy to seize their sacred sword. In response, Chuubou Sonken awakens her dragon but loses consciousness. Her sister Hakufu Sonsaku is determined to save Chuubou and recover her own magatama. This leads Hakufu to the mythical Jofuku Temple to receive intense training, risking her life in the process. As the veil between the living and spirit worlds starts to lift in Jofuku, Kanto's warriors must unite against Himiko's mysterious agenda. The turf wars have ended, but now an even greater threat looms.",
