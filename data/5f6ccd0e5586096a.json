  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an alternate world, sensha-do - the art of operating tanks in combat - is a traditional martial art practiced by girls and women. Miho Nishizumi, who comes from a prestigious sensha-do family, transfers to Ooarai Girlsâ€™ Academy, believing they do not have a sensha-do program. However, with the national sensha-do championships approaching, Ooarai decides to revive their team. As the only girl with prior experience, Miho is reluctantly drafted into the fledgling team. Joining her are her new friends - hotheaded driver Mako, unflappable gunner Hana, cheerful communicator Saori, and excitable tank fangirl Yukari. Together, this ragtag group of misfits must learn to operate WWII-era tanks as a cohesive crew. Facing Miho's traumatic past with sensha-do, as well as the pressure of saving their school from closure, the team must grow and bond to stand any chance in the championships. Overflowing with humor, heart, and clashing metal, Girls Und Panzer depicts these girls' journeys of self-discovery, reconciliation, and finding purpose and joy in unexpected places.",
