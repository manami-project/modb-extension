Miho Nishizumi, a transfer student with a troubled past in Sensha-do, finds herself unwillingly recruited by the student council president to join the school's team. With an eclectic mix of teammates, including an apocalyptic driver, a volatile gunner, a sensitive radio operator, and a tank enthusiast loader, Miho must overcome her past traumas and lead her team to victory. As they navigate through the challenges of Sensha-do, they discover the true meaning of teamwork, friendship, and determination. Will Miho and her team be able to save their school from closure and prove that the Nishizumi-style of Sensha-do is more than just about winning?
