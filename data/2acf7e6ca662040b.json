  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The planet Cypress was once peaceful until a mysterious terrorist group called Solomon, led by Duran Gash, seized control of seven powerful PDP missiles capable of destroying entire planets. In response, Jim Hyatt is chosen to lead a special team on an extremely dangerous mission - to rescue hostages, reclaim or destroy the missiles, and defeat the terrorists. However, the team members struggle to get along with each other. This synopsis describes an abridged and re-edited version of a 1998 sci-fi anime series. About one-third of the original footage was cut in order to tighten the pacing, including an entire subplot and many scenes. The remaining footage was also reorganized. As a result, this faster-paced adaptation transforms an originally slow show into an intense action thriller focused on the high stakes mission against the Solomon terrorists.",
