  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Marrius, a once tranquil planet, finds itself in the throes of chaos when Solomon, an enigmatic terrorist faction under the command of Duran Gash, takes control of seven devastating PDP missiles, each with the potential to annihilate entire planets. The responsibility to execute the seemingly unachievable task of rescuing hostages and retrieving or neutralizing these lethal missiles falls on the shoulders of Jim Hyatt, who must lead a team of mismatched individuals with a mutual dislike for each other.\n\nIn this condensed and reworked home video adaptation of the 1998 TV series, the narrative is streamlined, with approximately a third of the original content excised to enhance the pace. Subplots, such as Marrius', and entire episodes, like the third one, are omitted, while other scenes are rearranged in subsequent episodes.\n\nAWOL Compression Re-Mix, the abbreviated OVA version of the 1998 TV series AWOL, transforms a slow-moving series into a swiftly unfolding sci-fi action thriller. Brace yourself for a world filled with terrorists, unhinged hackers, and resolute special squad commanders, where the destiny of Earth hangs in the balance amidst a multitude of explosions!",
