    "text": "Phi-Brain~ Kami no Puzzle follows the extraordinary life of Kaito Daimon, a high school prodigy with an unparalleled knack for solving puzzles. When Kaito stumbles upon the cryptic Armband of Orpheus, he gains the ability to harness his brain's full potential, but at a steep cost. As an honor student at Root Academy, Kaito is handpicked by the principal to face POG, a nefarious organization that creates deadly puzzles to protect precious treasures and challenge those who dare to confront them.\n\nNow branded as a Solver and bestowed with the title of Einstein, Kaito must navigate a treacherous world of cunning traps and riddles, where one wrong move could spell disaster. Joined by his childhood friend Nanoha and other skilled Solvers, Kaito travels the globe, pitting his wits against POG's ingenious and often lethal puzzles. With each new challenge pushing him closer to the ultimate test, the Divine Puzzle, Kaito is determined to keep a promise he made long ago.\n\nAs the puzzles grow increasingly complex and dangerous, Kaito must rely on his intellect and the support of his friends to outwit POG and conquer the very challenges he cherishes. Will Kaito's love for puzzles be his salvation, or will it lead him down a path of destruction? Only time will tell in this thrilling, mind-bending adventure.",
