    "text": "The stage is set in 21st century Westland, New York, where a heartless killer, wielding a lethal blade, is on a rampage, claiming lives without discrimination. Amidst this chaos, Meg and Jo return to the city to commemorate the birthday of their dear friend, Shirley, an orphan they once cared for alongside two other children. Now under the guardianship of a righteous police officer, Sam, the children were believed to be living a content life.\n\nMeg and Jo, through a serendipitous act of kindness, earn a reward and use it to purchase a gift for Shirley. However, their joy is short-lived as they find Sam distressed, revealing that Shirley has fallen victim to the merciless killer and is now in critical condition. Fueled by anger and a desire for retribution, Meg and Jo vow to avenge Shirley.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the killer, a maniac with a twisted fascination for slasher films, is closing in on them. As they navigate through the treacherous labyrinth of their city, a sinister plot unfolds, casting a dark shadow over Meg, Jo, Sam, and the entire town. Will they be able to bring the perpetrator to justice, or will they become the next victims of his gruesome obsession? The stakes are high, and the hunt is on.",
