  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's been five years since a catastrophic event wiped out the entire population of Kamioki Island, sparing only one girl, Mari Wakatake, who lost all her memories of the incident. Now, under her grandmother's insistence, Mari enrolls at the prestigious Kaihou Academy, a girls-only boarding school. There, she encounters the enigmatic and popular Hagino, who seems to harbor a secret connection to Mari's forgotten past.\n\nAs Mari navigates her new life at the academy, she finds herself inexplicably drawn to Hagino, even as she grapples with her fear and anger towards her. Unbeknownst to Mari, Hagino is an alien sent to Earth to gather intel for an impending invasion. The tragic event that took place on Kamioki Island was a result of a deadly confrontation between Hagino's damaged spaceship crew and the island's inhabitants.\n\nAs Mari and Hagino's relationship evolves, Hagino starts to question her mission, seeing humans in a new light. Meanwhile, Mari slowly regains her lost memories, uncovering a terrifying truth about the nightmarish incident on the island and the role she and Hagino played in it. As the impending invasion looms closer, the two girls must confront their intertwined destinies and decide the fate of humanity.",
