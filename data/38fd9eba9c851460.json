  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With a comedic twist on Japan's Warring States period, this anime delves into the peculiar lives of legendary samurai generals and their loyal followers. From the eccentric Date Masamune, known for his eye patch fetish, to the swoon-worthy Ch≈çsokabe Motochika, the daimyos are far from the stoic leaders history books depict. Instead, they're a lively bunch with quirks that keep their servants on their toes. Masamune's obsession with accessorizing his horse, Shingen's confusion over his feelings for his rival, and Nobunaga's readiness to agree to outlandish battle strategies ensure that feudal Japan is anything but dull. Even historical grudges, like Akechi Mitsuhide's against Nobunaga, are transformed into comedic gold. This anime promises a unique take on history, parodying famous events and generals with a blend of humor and eccentricity.",
