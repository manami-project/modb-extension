  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When nine ordinary individuals from various corners of the globe are kidnapped and metamorphosed into powerful cyborgs, their creators intend for them to be weapons of destruction. Instead, these resilient beings rise against their makers, vowing to protect justice and world peace. Decades later, these cyborgs remain unscathed by time, yet the concept of justice has become increasingly complex in a world teeming with diverse perspectives. As they grapple with their purpose in this ever-changing landscape, an enigmatic force known as 'His Voice' emerges, compelling people to commit heinous acts of violence. Even Joe Shimamura, the cyborg 009, is not immune to this faceless power. In an age where cyber-terrorism is on the rise, how can these heroes combat an enemy that possesses no face, no weapons, and seemingly no motive? As skyscrapers around the world become targets for unknown terrorists, Dr. Isaac Gilmore reactivates his team of cyborgs to confront this extraordinary threat. Will they be able to unravel the mystery behind these attacks and restore peace to a world on the brink of chaos?",
