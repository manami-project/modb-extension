    "text": "Will power and determination shine through in the heartwarming tale of Ritsuko, a young girl born with a physical disability that impairs her ability to walk. Despite her challenging circumstances, Ritsuko's dreams are simple yet profound: to attend school and forge friendships just like any other child.\n\nHowever, life presents her with numerous obstacles. Her classmates, unable to empathize with her condition, resort to teasing her for her unusual gait. At home, her mother's overwhelming protectiveness, though well-intentioned, inadvertently hinders Ritsuko's growth.\n\nIn her journey towards self-discovery, Ritsuko finds solace and wisdom in the teachings of her blind masseur, Dr. Ishibashi. He introduces her to the true essence of kindness and strength, empowering her to set a seemingly paradoxical goal: to finish second-to-last in a footrace, an event where she's always expected to come last.\n\nAs Ritsuko navigates through societal barriers and personal challenges, she remains steadfast in her resolve to maintain her smile. This inspiring tale invites viewers to witness Ritsuko's incredible journey as she strives to find her place in the world.",
