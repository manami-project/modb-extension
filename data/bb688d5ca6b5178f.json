    "text": "How will a small zoo in northeastern Japan avoid the brink of collapse? The head zookeeper, Tange, and breeder, Matsuda, are tasked with finding a new group of animals to save the Wake Up, Girl Zoo! from being absorbed by a larger park. In response to an advertisement for a unique opportunity to become an idol with meals and naps included, seven girls in animal costumes come together to help. From the food-loving tiger Minami to the career-driven wolf Nanami, each girl brings her own quirks and motivations to the team. Can these seven creatures, with their singing and dancing, bring the zoo back from the brink and save it from closure? Only time will tell if their combined efforts will be enough to revive the struggling Wake Up, Girl Zoo!",
