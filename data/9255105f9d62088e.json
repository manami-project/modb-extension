    "text": "Other worldly portals leading to a demon realm have plagued humanity for centuries, resulting in a unified global effort led by the ancient Archean Mountain Sect to establish Dao Academies and secure these gateways. Enter Meng Chuan, a prodigious young swordsman with a tragic past, who seeks vengeance against the demons that claimed his mother's life. Driven by this singular purpose and fueled by his passion for drawing, Meng Chuan aims to join the Archean Mountain Sect to hone his skills and gain access to invaluable resources.\n\nAs Meng Chuan's peaceful life takes a tumultuous turn, he faces unexpected challenges, including a broken engagement and foreign invasions. With Ning City under threat, he takes up his sword and embarks on a perilous journey to become the strongest protector for its people.\n\nIn the Cangyuan Realm, where evil spirits wreak havoc, Meng Chuan's quest for vengeance begins at the Jinghu Taoist Temple. With unwavering courage and unmatched sword techniques, he punishes traitors and vanquishes demon clans, ascending to the pinnacle of the four great avenues. As his legend grows in Dongning Mansion and he gains reverence on Yuanchu Mountain, Meng Chuan's tale becomes one of gods and demons, defining an entire generation.",
