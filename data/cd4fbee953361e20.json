    "text": "After dying from overwork, an office lady finds herself reincarnated as Diana, the villainess of her favorite otome game, \"Hoshifuru Koi no Astrolabe.\" Diana is engaged to Prince Sirius, one of the main characters. On their first night together, Sirius passionately kisses Diana and intends to fully consummate their relationship. Diana realizes that Sirius was originally supposed to fall in love with the game's protagonist instead of her. She worries that her romance with Sirius may lead to the bad ending where the world is destroyed. In an effort to turn Sirius away, Diana attempts to seduce him so he will lose interest. However, her plan backfires and Sirius ends up falling deeper in love with her instead. Now faced with the prince's genuine affection, Diana must figure out how to navigate her new life and relationship while trying to prevent the prophesied destruction of the world.",
