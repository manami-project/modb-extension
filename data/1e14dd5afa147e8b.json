  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seirei Tsukai no Blade Dance takes place at Areishia Spirit Academy, an elite school that trains young women called shrine princesses to become elementalists - those who can form contracts with spirits and wield their power in battle. For 1,000 years, only females have been able to make these contracts, until Kamito Kazehaya arrives. He accidentally forms a contract with a spirit that shrine princess Claire Rouge had been trying to bond with, making Kamito the first male elementalist in centuries. Headmaster Greyworth summons Kamito to enroll at the academy and compete in an upcoming tournament called the Blade Dance. Claire is furious about losing her spirit and demands that Kamito become her contracted spirit instead. Over the next two months at Areishia, Kamito aims to survive Claire's wrath and prepare for the highly-anticipated Blade Dance competition, where he has been told to emerge victorious against a powerful elementalist wielding a darkness spirit.",
