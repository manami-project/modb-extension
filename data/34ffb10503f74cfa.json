    "text": "Kunou extends an invitation to Ranma and his friends for a luxurious yacht trip, but their plans for relaxation are swiftly shattered when a storm leaves them stranded on a desolate island. As if being shipwrecked wasn't enough, the girls in the group begin to mysteriously vanish, leaving only a peach behind. Ranma soon uncovers the truth: the girls have been abducted by Prince Toma, the young ruler of the floating island Togenkyo, to become part of his harem.\n\nIn a desperate bid to rescue the girls, Ranma enters a martial arts competition, disguised as a woman, to win the title of Toma's best bride. The contest includes bizarre challenges like 'survival flower-arranging' and 'obstacle-course cooking.' However, the island holds a secret that could potentially cure Ranma's shape-shifting predicament. Can Ranma navigate through the eccentric trials, secure the magical Togenkyo water, and save his friends, all while donning a push-up bra and high heels? Join Ranma on this thrilling, shape-shifting adventure!",
