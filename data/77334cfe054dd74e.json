    "text": "Fujiko, Lupin, Jigen, Goemon, and Zenigata - these legendary names in the world of anime didn't always work together. In the bustling streets of New York City, a young Lupin is on the hunt for a treasure like no other - a sword that can slice through anything and the recipe to forge such a weapon. But he's not the only one after it. Jigen, the fastest gun in the American underworld, is hired by the mafia to retrieve the treasure, turning the hunt into a personal vendetta against Lupin. Meanwhile, Goemon, a swordsman with a mysterious past, is also on the trail of the legendary sword, Zantetsuken.\n\nAs the three cross paths, Fujiko, a cunning and enigmatic woman, sees an opportunity to claim the treasure for herself. Hot on her heels is Zenigata, a determined Japanese detective who will stop at nothing to capture her. Amidst the chaos, alliances are formed, and betrayals are inevitable. Witness the thrilling origin story of the Lupin gang in their first contact, a tale of ambition, revenge, and the birth of a legendary partnership.",
