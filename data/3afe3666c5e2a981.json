  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tove Jansson's beloved Moomin books serve as a loose inspiration for this anime series, although it deviates significantly from the original source material in terms of plot, ambiance, character traits, and even names, which did not sit well with Jansson herself. The series is geared more towards adults than children, despite its cute and endearing Moomin troll characters.\n\nThe Moomin trolls reside in the vibrant Moomin valley, where young Moomin enjoys everyday adventures with his friends and family, including his parents, Moomin Papa and Moomin Mama. The production of the series is split between two studios, with episodes 1 to 26 being produced by Tokyo Movie Shinsha (TMS Entertainment Co., Ltd.) and episodes 27 to 65 by Mushi Production.\n\nThe series offers a fresh take on the Moomin trolls and their colorful world, inviting viewers to embark on exciting adventures with Moomin and his loved ones. Despite its departure from the original books, the anime promises an engaging and entertaining experience for its audience.",
