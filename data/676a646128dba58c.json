  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Priss on her Motoroid, Linna, Nene, Sylia, Mackie, and a Boomer from Bubblegum Crisis, Gall Force, and Genesis Survivor Gaiarth, along with other characters from AD Police and Riding Bean, are all set to compete in a wild and chaotic race organized by Genom. The winner will receive the prestigious Genom Trophy, and all the contestants are willing to do anything to claim it. The anime is filled with super-deformed madness and general insanity, reminiscent of Wacky Races. The show is a hilarious parody of these sci-fi based anime, and even if you haven't seen any of them, you'll still enjoy the zany antics of the characters. However, if you're familiar with the series, you'll appreciate the in-jokes and references even more. So buckle up for a wild ride in Scramble Wars!",
