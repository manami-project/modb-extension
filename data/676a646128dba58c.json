  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Scramble Wars is a zany anime comedy featuring chibi versions of characters from several popular sci-fi anime series competing in an outrageous no-holds-barred race. The race is being held by the mysterious Genom corporation, with the winner receiving the coveted Genom Trophy. Racers include Priss on her motorcycle, the Knight Sabers team of Sylia, Linna, Nene, and Mackie, as well as characters from Bubblegum Crisis, Gall Force, Genesis Survivor Gaiarth, A.D. Police, and Riding Bean. Though the premise is silly, the show hilariously parodies and pays homage to these classic anime through over-the-top super deformed antics. Fans will delight at references to the source material, but the wacky humor stands alone enough for anyone to enjoy. As contestants sabotage and battle their way to the finish line through various insane obstacles, Scramble Wars offers non-stop energetic fun. So strap in alongside cyberpunk heroes and mecha pilots turned chibi racers for an uproarious scramble to the end.",
