    "text": "Yukiai Nagisa, a high school girl residing in a tranquil coastal town, has always been captivated by her grandmother's tales of 'kotodama,' spirits that inhabit words. Struggling to find her life's purpose, Nagisa stumbles upon an abandoned mini FM radio station one day. Acting on a whim, she seizes the opportunity to become a DJ, using the station's old equipment to broadcast her thoughts and experiences. Unbeknownst to her, her voice finds its way to an unexpected listener, sparking a series of events that intertwine the lives of those touched by her words. As Nagisa navigates through her adolescent years, her broadcasts echo the worries, dreams, and conflicts of a typical high school girl, reaching out to those who find solace in her heartfelt narrations.",
