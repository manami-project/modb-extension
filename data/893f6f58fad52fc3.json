  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After years of self-imposed isolation, 22-year-old Tatsuhiro Satou's life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters the enigmatic Misaki Nakahara. Satou, a university dropout, has become a recluse, known as a 'hikikomori,' spending his days consumed by conspiracy theories and the belief that the nefarious NHK is responsible for his shut-in lifestyle.\n\nMisaki, determined to help Satou break free from his hikikomori existence, challenges him to confront his fears and rejoin society. Along the way, Satou must navigate various obstacles, including creating a hentai game with his otaku neighbor, managing his relationship with his conspiracy-theorist senpai, and even facing the possibility of joining a suicide cult.\n\nAs Satou and Misaki embark on this journey, they explore the depths of hikikomori and otaku culture, grapple with existential questions, and confront the harsh realities of life. Will Satou find the courage to overcome his crippling anxieties and embrace the world outside his apartment, or will the imagined NHK conspiracy keep him trapped in his self-imposed prison forever? Join Satou in this psychological dramedy as he struggles to reclaim his life and find his place in society.",
