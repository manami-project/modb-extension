  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hayato and Haruki were childhood friends who used to play together in the countryside when they were young. Seven years later, Hayato transfers to a high school in the city and reunites with Haruki, except she has grown into a beautiful and innocent girl that he barely recognizes. In private, Haruki retains her brash country mannerisms that remind Hayato of their childhood days playing in the mud. However, in front of classmates, she puts on a prim facade as \"The Takamine Flower.\" The two reconnect through shared lunches, games at home, and Hayato's playful teasing. Underneath Haruki's new girlish exterior lies the same childhood friend Hayato remembers. Their relationship navigates both change and continuity. The country setting has been swapped for the city, the boy has become a girl. Yet their history as friends endures, bound by lingering feelings and promises from the past. As they rediscover their bond, both must reconcile fond memories with their evolving present.",
