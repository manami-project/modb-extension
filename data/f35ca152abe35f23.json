  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hayato, after a childhood spent in the countryside, finds himself transferred to a city high school. There, he encounters a familiar face - Haruki, his childhood friend. However, the once bratty boy he used to play in the mud with has transformed into a beautiful, poised young lady, known as The Takamine Flower of her class. Despite her new persona, when they are alone, Haruki sheds her refined demeanor, revealing the same crass, playful spirit Hayato remembers. As they reconnect, they share lunches in empty classrooms, play games at home, and reminisce about their past. Yet, Hayato can't help but notice the blush that creeps onto Haruki's face when he teases her, hinting at feelings that may have evolved over time. Amidst the changes, some things remain constant - their bond, and a promise made at the end of a long-ago summer.",
