    "text": "Goat-demon Chiyo, known for her unfathomable power, crosses paths with Yuu, an orphan who has faced a lifetime of hardships. After losing his parents in a tragic car accident, Yuu's life has been a series of neglect and abuse at the hands of his relatives. Craving companionship and a place to call home, Yuu is granted one wish by Chiyo. His plea: to have a caring older sister.\n\nChiyo obliges, taking Yuu under her wing and providing the love and care he has longed for. However, this newfound solace comes at a price. In exchange for Chiyo's generosity, Yuu must supply her with his 'life potential.' Little does he know, Chiyo's true identity is that of Shub-Niggurath, the 'Black Goat of the Woods with a Thousand Young.' As their bond deepens, Yuu must navigate the complexities of his new life with Chiyo, unaware of the sinister intentions that lie beneath her sisterly facade.",
