    "text": "Gon is an orphaned fox living near a village in the woods of Japan. One day, he playfully steals an eel that was caught by Hyoju, a young village boy hoping to help his sick mother. However, Hyoju's mother soon dies, leaving Gon feeling responsible. Seeking to make amends, Gon begins secretly leaving small gifts for Hyoju every day. Meanwhile, Hyoju leaves a red spider lily flower for the unknown gift-giver. Despite Gon's attempts at kindness, tragedy seems inevitable for the two, unable to fully connect across the divide between man and beast. Set against the tranquil backdrop of nature, this melancholy yet gentle tale explores the barriers that keep all beings apart.",
