  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime centers around an unusual creature that destroyed a large portion of the moon. Nicknamed \"Koro-sensei\", this smiley-faced being possesses immense power and speed. However, rather than immediately destroying Earth, Koro-sensei proposes a challenge - he will teach a classroom of students who must try to assassinate him within a year. If they fail, then Koro-sensei will obliterate Earth. The prequel episode depicts the initial distrustful meeting between Koro-sensei and Karasuma, a government agent tasked with overseeing the assassination classroom. After an uneventful first encounter, the two eventually gain mutual respect for one another despite their opposing goals. As the series progresses, viewers follow the daily school life of Koro-sensei and his students. While striving to learn assassination techniques, the students also benefit from Koro-sensei's excellent and unconventional teaching abilities. The overarching narrative becomes whether or not the students can successfully assassinate their teacher before Earth's destruction.",
