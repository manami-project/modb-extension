    "text": "Later included as an extra in the first volume of the Blu-ray and DVD release, the \"Assassination Classroom\" TV series' Episode 0, titled \"Meeting Time,\" initially aired at the Jump Festa 2014 events. This prequel to the first season introduces us to the first encounter between the enigmatic, smiley-headed creature, Koro-sensei, and Karasuma, which Koro-sensei nostalgically recalls. In this recollection, the two clash and engage in a heated battle, ultimately leading to mutual respect. However, Karasuma reveals that the actual meeting was far less dramatic.\n\nThe story unfolds against the backdrop of an inexplicable catastrophe, where 70% of the moon has been abruptly vaporized. The perpetrator, Koro-sensei, is detained in a high-security prison, where it casually announces its intention to destroy Earth next. But in a surprising turn of events, Koro-sensei decides to give humanity another chance, setting the stage for the thrilling and unpredictable events to come.",
