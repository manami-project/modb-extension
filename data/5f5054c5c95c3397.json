    "text": "In 2006, humanity is plagued by a mysterious and deadly phenomenon called \"Algernon\" that turns people violently insane with no explanation. When the police can no longer manage the bizarre murders, Akamatsu Industries, secretly developing neural weapons called \"NeuroNoids,\" takes up the fight. Keita, an ordinary boy, has a chance encounter with his childhood friend Hinoki, now a NeuroNoid pilot working for Akamatsu. Together, they witness an Algernon attack and are rescued by the legendary Betterman, a mysterious mutant. As Keita joins forces with Hinoki and Akamatsu to uncover the truth behind Algernon, they face many threats and mysteries. Who is Betterman? Why does he protect them? And what is the cause of the unending nightmare brought by Algernon? Through it all, one thing is clear - Akamatsu hides sinister secrets about these neural weapons. But armed with Hinoki's NeuroNoid mecha and the aid of Betterman, Keita is determined to expose the truth, no matter the cost.",
