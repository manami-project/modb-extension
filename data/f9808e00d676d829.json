  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The stage is set in the vast expanse of the ocean, where a lone man finds himself stranded on a raft. His most pressing concern is not the solitude, but the unquenchable thirst that plagues him. However, a glimmer of hope appears in the form of a few precious raindrops that have collected on the raft's mast. The man's attempts to capture these elusive drops of water unfold in a series of comedic mishaps, reminiscent of classic cartoon capers. This humorous spectacle is the brainchild of Tezuka Osamu, who, in just a week, single-handedly crafted this delightful independent film, even illustrating all the backgrounds himself. Will our hapless hero finally quench his thirst, or will the elements continue to conspire against him? Only time will tell in this entertaining and engaging anime.",
