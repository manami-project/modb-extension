  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is the summer of 1907 in Kyoto, Japan. 15-year-old Inako Momokawa lives in the Fushimi district and is the second daughter of a sake brewer. She frequently makes mistakes in her work and receives daily scoldings from her father. Her only solace is praying at the local Fushimi Inari shrine. There Inako meets Kihachi Sakamoto, a freewheeling young man who rejects the gods and embraces the incoming age of electricity. When Inako's father decides to arrange her marriage without consulting her, she loses hope. Kihachi encourages Inako's desire to avoid the marriage and run away. He tells her about a book he wrote as a child predicting the age of electricity - the \"Electricity Catalog\" - which his brother later took. Kihachi believes finding this book is the only way to stop Inako's unwanted marriage. Together, Inako and Kihachi embark on a search for the \"Electricity Catalog\" across Kyoto and Shiga prefectures. Their journey takes place against the backdrop of a Japan balancing tradition and modernity on the cusp of the 20th century. More than just a story of young love, it reveals the dreams, conflicts, and transformations shaping ordinary lives during the Meiji era.",
