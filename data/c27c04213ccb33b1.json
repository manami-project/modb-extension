  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When the world is once again thrust into peril, Ditt, the once formidable Mix Master, finds himself bereft of his past heroics. As he grapples with his forgotten identity, he forges alliances with new companions to confront the menacing duo, Eva and Babel. However, their triumph is short-lived as they cross paths with the true villain, Red Knight, a fallen hero ensnared by his own insatiable lust for power.\n\nUpon vanquishing the Red Knight, our heroes brace themselves for yet another threat: Blue Fox, a power-crazed ally of the Red Knight, hell-bent on seizing the Dark Mix Masters. Amidst these trials, they must also contend with a mysterious white witch claiming to be Moreen's mother, and an evil infant named Ruth or Root, who purports to be Moreen's younger brother.\n\nJust as they believe their arduous journey has reached its conclusion, an unexpected portal opens from Gamebridge to Atreia, reuniting Ditt and his comrades with their henches. In this new chapter, they come to realize that their adventure has only just begun, and their roles as Mix Masters are far from over.",
