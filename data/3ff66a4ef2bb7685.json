    "text": "While the allure of the supernatural can be enticing, two groups of young individuals learn the hard way that some mysteries are better left unsolved. In one tale, Masami's life takes a dark turn with the arrival of a captivating new student, Rima, who seems to be the source of her escalating nightmares and inexplicable scars. Desperate for answers, Masami enlists a friend to help uncover the truth behind her suspicions, but the revelations they capture on video may be more chilling than they ever anticipated.\n\nIn the second story, four friends, led by the daring Nanako and hesitant Miko, seek a thrill beyond their ordinary lives by exploring a local abandoned mansion, rumored to be haunted. As they delve deeper into the eerie building, their excitement turns to dread as they encounter a series of terrifying events. With their lives, sanity, and perception of reality at stake, they must rely on luck and courage to escape the mansion's sinister grasp.",
