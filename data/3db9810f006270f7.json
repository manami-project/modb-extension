  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Snake and Scorpion spirits, once imprisoned in the Calabash Mountains, are unwittingly released by a pangolin, causing havoc in the nearby village. In a desperate attempt to save the villagers, the pangolin seeks out an old man, sharing the legend of the seven rainbow-colored calabashes that can vanquish the spirits. The old man wastes no time, planting the legendary seeds, and as each calabash ripens and falls to the ground, it transforms into a boy with extraordinary abilities. These seven calabash brothers, each with a unique power and weakness, embark on a thrilling 13-episode adventure to defeat the demons. But little do they know, a third demon, the sister of the snake spirit, lies in wait, seeking vengeance for her siblings' defeat. The stage is set for an epic battle between the calabash brothers and the demonic forces threatening their land.",
