    "text": "When an otherworldly princess named Lum falls in love with the earthbound, lady-chasing Ataru Moroboshi, the conquest of Earth by her Oni kin takes an unexpected turn. Now, Lum finds herself spending more time on Earth, engaging in enchanting escapades with her human companions. But a dark curse looms over Lum, cast by a vengeful witch who was snubbed at Lum's birth celebration, threatening her happiness with her true love. When a visit to a newly opened amusement park results in Ataru's transformation into a pink hippopotamus during a magic act, Lum embarks on a mission to find the magician responsible and restore her beloved's human form. As Lum navigates through increasingly bizarre circumstances, can she break the curse and secure her happiness with Ataru, or will their fates be forever entwined with others?",
