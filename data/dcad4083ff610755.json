    "text": "The anime follows Aoba Suzukaze, a new employee at the fictional video game company Eagle Jump. It provides a glimpse into the world of game development as Aoba and her colleagues work on the \"Fairies Story\" franchise. After working tirelessly to complete the latest Fairies Story game, the Eagle Jump staff finally take a vacation to a ski resort to celebrate and unwind. Being her first company trip, Aoba looks forward to bonding with her coworkers, though she feels apprehensive about skiing since she has no prior experience. Nevertheless, she is excited to join her colleagues in de-stressing and making the most of their time off at the beautiful snowy resort. Additionally, fans who collect tickets from all six Blu-ray/DVD volumes of the anime will receive an exclusive unaired 13th episode OVA. This bonus episode is set at an open-air hot springs bath, offering one more fun escapade with the characters.",
