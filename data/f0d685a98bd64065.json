  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in Academy City, a technologically advanced locale filled with students developing psychic abilities known as espers, the story follows Touma Kamijou, a high school boy with the power \"Imagine Breaker\" which allows him to negate other supernatural powers. Though useful, his ability does not prevent his chronic bad luck in everyday life. One day, Touma finds a young nun named Index hanging on his apartment balcony. Index has a remarkable gift - she has memorized 103,000 forbidden magical texts known as the Index-Librorum-Prohibitorum. However, this makes her a target of dangerous organizations seeking to acquire her knowledge, forcing Touma to protect Index while contending with threats from both the world of science and magic. As Touma helps Index, they become embroiled in the secret conflict between espers and magicians over the secrets behind Academy City's advanced technology and research into psychic abilities. Touma also encounters allies and rivals with fantastic powers unlike anything he's seen before. In defending Index, Touma discovers there's more to both his new companion and Academy City than meets the eye.",
