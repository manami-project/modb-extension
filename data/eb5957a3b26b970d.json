    "text": "After years of shared laughter and memories, four inseparable friends—Natsumi, Saki, Yuka, and Rinko—stand on the precipice of change as they approach the end of their middle school journey. With the bittersweet news of Saki's impending transfer to another school, the girls resolve to make the most of their remaining time together. Harkening back to their childhood, they revisit an old Shinto shrine in Shimoda, where a large rock is rumored to grant the wishes of four friends who gather around it. To their astonishment, the ancient legend proves true, and the girls embark on a magical summer filled with wonder and self-discovery. As they navigate the trials and triumphs of friendship, they weave a tapestry of unforgettable moments, determined to cherish every last second of their time together. Amidst the enchanting miracles they experience, the four friends learn valuable lessons about themselves and the enduring power of their bond. As the end of summer draws near, they realize that even though they may eventually part ways, the memories they've created will forever remain etched in their hearts.",
