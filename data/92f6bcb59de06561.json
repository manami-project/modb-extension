    "text": "Rabuge is an anime series that intertwines the stories of two sets of ambitious women. The first duo, Yoshizumi Aimi and Sasajima Kaoruko, are a comedy act with dreams of making it big on Broadway. To boost their popularity, they take on a side gig as heroines of justice, vanquishing villains left and right. However, their crime-fighting antics often leave chaos in their wake, leading to an unfortunate reputation as villains themselves.\n\nThe second group consists of the five Hokke sisters, who, despite their humble means, aspire to become the ultimate villains to honor their deceased father's wish. Upon discovering a sealed jar, they release a demon who reveals their latent powers, transforming them into the Gedo Otome Tai when they wield their weapons. Despite their evil aspirations, their actions often result in helping others, creating a comical paradox. Both groups grapple with poverty and misconceptions as they strive to achieve their dreams, making for an entertaining and unpredictable narrative.",
