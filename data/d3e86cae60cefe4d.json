Among the audience are Monkey D. Luffy and the Straw Hat Crew, who are excited to witness the performance of Luffy's childhood friend and Red Hair Pirates' former musician. However, Uta's deep-seated disdain for pirates and Luffy's refusal to abandon his pirate lifestyle lead to a confrontation, revealing that the Straw Hats have been trapped in Uta's dream world since the concert began. As they struggle to escape, they must also come to terms with the shocking revelation that Uta is the daughter of the legendary pirate, Shanks. With time running out, the crew must find a way to break free from Uta's dream world or risk being trapped forever. Will they be able to escape and reunite with their captain, or will they succumb to Uta's otherworldly powers? Only time will tell in this thrilling and emotional adventure.",
