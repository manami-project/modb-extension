    "text": "The theatrical follow-up to the popular swimming anime series \"Free!\" centers on Haruka, Rin, Ikuya, and other top Japanese swimmers as they travel to Sydney to compete in the prestigious Swimming World Cup tournament. There, they finally get the chance to race against elite world-class opponents on the global stage. Haruka in particular has long dreamt of visiting Sydney, and now finds himself immersed in this new competitive environment, carrying the hopes and passions of all the fellow swimmers he's bonded with over the years. Waiting to challenge him is the tournament's reigning champion, Albert Volandel. As the Sydney meet draws near, athletes from around the world attempt to boost their confidence and find the will to keep pushing themselves to the limit. What drives each swimmer to compete at such a high level? Their struggle against the water - and against their own self-doubt - promises to be dramatic and inspiring. This tournament marks the climactic chapter of the acclaimed \"Free!\" franchise.",
