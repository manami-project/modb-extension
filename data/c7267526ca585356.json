  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Narumi Detective Agency's Shoutarou Hidari and his enigmatic partner Philip are the guardians of Fuuto, a city plagued by sinister Dopants. These monstrous beings emerge from the misuse of Gaia Memories, powerful artifacts that can transform their users into dangerous creatures. As Kamen Rider W, Shoutarou and Philip use their own Gaia Memories to combat these threats, preserving the peace in Fuuto.\n\nHowever, the emergence of a mysterious woman named Tokime casts a dark shadow over the city. Linked to a series of homicides and thefts, Tokime's true identity remains shrouded in mystery. As the duo delves deeper into the case, they discover a resurgence of Gaia Memory users, posing a new threat to Fuuto's safety.\n\nWith the police force unable to contain the Dopant menace, Shoutarou and Philip must once again don their Kamen Rider W mantle. Their mission: to unravel the secret behind Tokime's identity, confront their city's forgotten past, and eradicate the lingering Dopant menace to safeguard Fuuto's future.",
