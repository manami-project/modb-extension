    "text": "Diabolik Lovers follows the journey of Yui Komori, an optimistic high school girl with a peculiar ability to see spirits and experience supernatural phenomena. When her father's job forces her to transfer to a new school, she finds herself in an unusual institution filled with celebrities and entertainers. Amidst the rumors of vampires roaming the halls, Yui's life takes a dramatic turn as she becomes entangled with the sadistic Sakamaki brothers, a group of pureblood vampires who take her captive in their mansion.\n\nAs Yui struggles to adapt to her new life, she encounters the enigmatic Mukami brothers—Ruki, Azusa, Kou, and Yuuma—who claim her as their 'Eve.' According to their prophecy, her blood will help them find the 'Adam' and grant them the power to rule the world. Caught between these two rival vampire families, Yui must navigate the treacherous world of bloodlust, power struggles, and unexpected alliances.\n\nThroughout her high school years, Yui's resilience and positive spirit are tested as she faces the challenges of living with the vampire brothers. Based on a drama CD and PSP game, Diabolik Lovers weaves a thrilling tale of love, mystery, and danger that will keep viewers on the edge of their seats.",
