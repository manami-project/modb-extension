    "text": "The world of Japanese middle school girls' ping pong is shaken up when the long-reigning champions from Oudou Academy are unexpectedly defeated, creating an opening for other teams to vie for the national tournament. Suzumegahara Middle School has their own scrappy ping pong team comprised of Hanabi, Hokuto, Agari, Mune, and captain Kiruka. Though skilled, they have never advanced past local competitions. However, the arrival of passionate transfer student Koyori Tsumujikaze injects new energy into the team. Her infectious love of ping pong ignites the competitive drive in each girl. Together, they set their sights on the national tournament, determined to seize this new opportunity. As the throne sits empty, the stage is set for a heated rivalry between girls who live and breathe ping pong. Koyori and the Suzumegahara team are ready to bring the winds of change, but it remains to be seen if they have what it takes to become the next champions.",
