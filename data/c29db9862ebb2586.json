    "text": "Japanese cities were struck by ten missiles on November 22, 2010, in an unprecedented terrorist attack that came to be known as 'Careless Monday.' Despite the initial shock, the incident was soon forgotten as it resulted in no casualties. Three months later, Saki Morimi, a young woman on her graduation trip to the United States, finds herself in an unexpected predicament in front of the White House in Washington, D.C. A mysterious fellow countryman, Akira Takizawa, comes to her rescue. Takizawa, however, is an enigma; he appears to have lost his memory, is completely naked, and carries only a gun and a mobile phone loaded with a staggering 8.2 billion yen in digital cash. As Saki becomes entangled in Takizawa's world, she uncovers a thrilling death game connected to the forgotten missile strike, forever altering her life and challenging the world's salvation.",
