  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime explores the theme of perseverance through hardship. It follows a protagonist who repeatedly stumbles and fails in their endeavors, represented metaphorically by a glass that chips each time they fall. Though frustrated, they choose to start over from scratch after each setback. The story suggests that while the process can be painful, there is value in persistence. The protagonist discovers insights and answers that come only through repetition of this cycle of trying, failing, and trying again. Each chip in the glass represents a lesson that brings them closer to their goal. Ultimately, the narrative implies that the capacity to endure and the drive to keep going originates from within oneself, even in the face of difficulty. By embracing this mindset of determination, the protagonist inches towards progress. Though the road is winding, littered with obstacles, the anime affirms the human spirit's ability to learn and evolve through unrelenting effort.",
