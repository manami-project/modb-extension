    "text": "Tokyo University of the Arts witnesses a unique journey in its 2016 Graduate Work, where a student from the Department of Animation grapples with recurring setbacks. The path to success is fraught with stumbles, and with each fall, the glass they hold chips a little more. Yet, with every new beginning, they uncover hidden truths that only repetition can reveal. The answer to their quest lies within themselves, waiting to be discovered in the heart of resilience and determination. This anime is a testament to the power of perseverance and self-discovery.",
