  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Using three-minute episodes, \"Vampire Holmes\" presents a unique twist on the classic detective tale. The story follows the titular character, Holmes, who, despite his name, doesn't rely on deductive reasoning to solve mysteries. Instead, he's hired by the Metropolitan Police of London to hunt down vampires plaguing the city. Alongside his assistant, Hudson, and their not-so-black demon cat, Kira, Holmes embarks on a series of supernatural adventures. However, their mission is often derailed by their constant bickering and general ineptitude, much to the dismay of their terrifying, rent-hungry landlady. Despite their shortcomings, this unlikely team promises a thrilling and comedic ride, proving that they're anything but London's greatest detectives.",
