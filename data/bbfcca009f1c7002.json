As they embark on a mission to locate a missing person, Kakashi senses a trap and gets separated from his students - Naruto, Sasuke, and Sakura. The three are then ambushed by mysterious ninjas who kidnap Sakura. Now Naruto and Sasuke must join forces to battle the ninjas and rescue their teammate, while Kakashi struggles to escape the trap and reunite the squad.
