    "text": "This anime, \"Atarashii Joushi wa Dotennen,\" follows the story of Kentaro Momose, a 26-year-old office worker who finds himself at a crossroads after enduring relentless bullying and demotions from his power-hungry boss. In search of a fresh start, Momose takes a leap of faith and joins a new company, only to find himself paralyzed with fear on his first day due to past traumas. As he worries about facing another abusive boss, Momose is taken aback by the unexpectedly goofy and clumsy nature of his new supervisor, Yusei Shirosaki. Despite his initial concerns, Momose soon realizes that Shirosaki is a far cry from his previous boss, as he is genuinely concerned about his employees' well-being and willing to go the extra mile to help them. As Momose navigates his new work environment, he begins to wonder if he has finally found a place where he can heal and be happy.",
