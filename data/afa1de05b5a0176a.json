Nagisa, a high school girl with dreams of becoming a professional wrestler, finds herself thrust into this intergalactic conflict when she is chosen to become an Iczelion. Despite her initial reluctance and timid nature, Nagisa must rise to the challenge and embrace her new role as Earth's defender, all while clinging to her dreams and the normal life she once knew.
