    "text": "Continuation High School may be the underdog, but they're not going down without a fight in the quarterfinals of the Winter Continuous Track Cup. With Jouko, their enigmatic sharpshooter, they're giving Saunders University High School a run for their money. Meanwhile, Ooarai Girls Academy and Chi-Ha-Tan Academy are locked in a grueling 12-hour jungle battle, with both teams running on empty and neither able to gain the upper hand. Miho Nishizumi and her teammates refuse to back down, determined to land a decisive blow before their opponents do.\n\nOver on the other battlegrounds, St. Gloriana Girls College and Anzio High School are engaged in a fierce showdown, while Kuromorimine Girls Academy is struggling against Pravda High School. Erika Itsumi, now leading Kuromorimine, takes Maho Nishizumi's advice to heart and breaks free from the school's rigid tactics, turning the tide in their favor.\n\nWith only four semifinal spots available, each team must bring their A-game and employ constantly evolving strategies to survive. Firepower and logistics are crucial, as having enough ammo to keep firing is just as important as getting tanks into position. The stakes are high, and only the strongest will advance to the next round!",
