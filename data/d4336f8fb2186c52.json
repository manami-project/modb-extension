    "text": "Energy-thieving space pirates have set their sights on Earth, and it's up to one unsuspecting fifth-grader and a group of powerful robots to save the day! Seiji Takasugi stumbles into a hidden world of intergalactic conflict when his town is attacked by a UFO. He discovers that he has been chosen by the Earth's alter ego, Orin, to command the legendary Brave Fighters â€“ eight robots who have been protecting the planet since its inception. These robots, disguised as Brave Stones, are scattered across the globe and must be awakened by Seiji to fuse with modern machines and join the battle against the invading forces led by Lord Oh-Boss. As the new commander, Seiji must balance his everyday life with his secret mission to find and activate the Brave Fighters, control his own car-turned-robot Da Garn, and prevent his classmates from discovering his incredible secret. Join Seiji and the Brave Fighters as they fight to protect Earth's life energy and save the world from imminent destruction!",
