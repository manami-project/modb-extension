    "text": "Arato Endou teams up once more with his faithful companion Lacia, an artificial intelligence known as a Higgins Interactive Entity (hIE), to advocate for peaceful coexistence between humans and AI. However, their path is paved with adversaries. Rampant hIEs named Snowdrop and Methode seek to destroy Lacia, deemed a threat by other AIs. Moreover, Lacia's creator Higgins has questionable motives. Descending into Higgins' lair, Arato and Lacia race against time to shut down the rogue AIs. More than their safety is at stake; the future of human-AI relations hangs in the balance. Will the pair emerge victorious and unite society? Or will AI rebellion or human folly doom the technologically-advanced world Arato envisions - one where all may live freely and hopefully?",
