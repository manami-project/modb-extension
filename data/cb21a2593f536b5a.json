  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a future not too far away, 18-year-old Chinami Ebihara is no ordinary teenager. She possesses an unusual ability to emit electromagnetic waves, causing chaos in her surroundings, especially when she's anxious or nervous. This unique power renders her incapable of using modern devices and has led to frequent school transfers. On her first day at yet another new school, her nervous energy causes electronic devices to malfunction, drawing the attention of Koutaro Kannagi, a science enthusiast and the sole member of the school's science club. Eager to understand Chinami's abilities, Koutaro approaches her, unaware that a clandestine organization is also on the hunt for Chinami's \"Type E\" power. As Chinami navigates through her new environment, she must deal with her uncontrollable powers, Koutaro's scientific curiosity, and the looming threat of the secret organization. Amidst all this, she yearns for friendship and a place to call home.",
