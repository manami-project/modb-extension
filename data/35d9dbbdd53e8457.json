    "text": "Fu Sawatari moves to Takehara, a scenic town near Hiroshima, to start high school. She carries on her late father's legacy through her passion for photography, using his old film camera to capture the magic of everyday life. As Fu makes new friends, she reminisces about her father, wonders about her future, and tries to spread joy to others with her warm, friendship-filled photos. Believing photographs can connect hearts and turn ordinary moments into something special, Fu and her friends seize every chance to take pictures of their surroundings. Though Fu deeply misses her father, whom she used to visit Takehara with, she finds happiness in pursuing their shared love of photography in her new hometown.",
