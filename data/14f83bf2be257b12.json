  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In Cosmic Era 73, two years after the end of the war between the PLANT space colonies and Earth, tensions remain high between the genetically-enhanced Coordinators of PLANT and regular Naturals of Earth. During a diplomatic meeting between PLANT's Chairman Durandal and Orb Union's Representative Athha, ZAFT's new prototype mobile suits called Gundams are hijacked by a mysterious group. ZAFT soldier Shinn Asuka and the crew of the battleship Minerva launch into action to retrieve the stolen Gundams. They are aided by Athha's bodyguard, ZAFT veteran Athrun Zala. Though the Gundams are retrieved, the incident sparks the beginning of another war. Shinn lost his family during a prior battle in Orb. He now pilots ZAFT's newest Gundam, the Impulse. Still filled with vengeance over his family's death, he must overcome his bitterness with the guidance of Athrun. Or else his rage may consume him as the world descends into further chaos. The story spans 50 episodes which were remastered in HD in 2013 with enhanced animation and some altered scenes. The remaster provides a visually-improved viewing experience for this epic conflict between factions of humanity struggling to coexist.",
