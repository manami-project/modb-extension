    "text": "Yachin Due's second battle may have ended the war between Naturals and Coordinators, but the peace that followed was fragile. In Cosmic Era 73, tensions between the two factions remained high, and a new conflict was on the horizon. When a group of rogue soldiers infiltrated the PLANTs and stole ZAFT's latest Gundam prototypes, it was up to ZAFT soldier Shinn Asuka and his crew aboard the Minerva to retrieve them. Shinn, a Coordinator who lost his family during the war, was no stranger to conflict. As he and his crew pursued the stolen Gundams, they found themselves drawn into a new war that threatened to consume them all. With the help of Cagalli Yula Athha, the Orb representative, and her bodyguard Athrun Zala, Shinn and his crew fought to restore peace to the galaxy. But as the war raged on, Shinn's desire for vengeance threatened to consume him. Could he find a way to overcome his anger and find peace, or would he be consumed by the very conflict he sought to end?",
