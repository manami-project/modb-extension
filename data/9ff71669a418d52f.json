    "text": "The starship XeBeC, on a seemingly ordinary voyage in the year 2755, encounters an unexpected catastrophe when an engine room explosion sends it careening off-course through a warp gate. Stranded on the far-flung, Earth-like planet Garaga, the crew faces a relentless battle for survival against terrifying dinosaur-like beasts and aggressive ape-soldiers. As the crew's true mission comes to light, they find themselves entangled in a web of political intrigue and hidden agendas. With the vice-admiral of the Space Federation's daughter among them, the crew must confront the mysterious psychic inhabitants of Garaga and unravel the ruthless plot orchestrated by a powerful general. It falls to Jay M. Jay to uncover the truth and save not only the crew but the entire galaxy from an unimaginable threat.",
