    "text": "Kanade Amakusa is a high school student cursed with a power called \"Absolute Choice\" that forces him to select between two outrageous options that suddenly appear in his mind. As a result of frequently having to make absurd decisions in public, Kanade has become an outcast at school. However, Kanade's life takes an unexpected turn when he makes a choice that causes a beautiful girl named Chocolat to literally fall from the sky. Chocolat reveals that she has been sent by God with a mission to help Kanade. If Kanade can successfully complete a series of extreme challenges set by God, his curse may finally be cured. With Chocolat's help, Kanade resolves to clear these divine trials, no matter how crazy they may be. His goals are to rid himself of the curse that has made his life miserable, regain his reputation at school, and experience a normal high school romance for the first time.",
