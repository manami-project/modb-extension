  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jo is the daughter of a wealthy family living in 4th century China during the Eastern Jin dynasty, a time when women faced many restrictions on education and independence. Desperate to study, Jo convinces her reluctant parents to let her attend school by disguising herself as a man. On the way there she meets Leon, a young scholar from a modest background. Over the next three years at school, Jo and Leon become close friends as they live and study together, unaware of Jo's true identity. Gradually, Jo falls deeply in love with Leon. When she finally reveals to Leon that she is a woman, he realizes he reciprocates her feelings. However, their difference in social status presents barriers to them being together. Upon hearing that Jo's family has arranged for her to marry a wealthy man, Leon becomes heartbroken and falls gravely ill. Their dream of being together seems impossible in the rigid social hierarchy of their time and place. Yet the depth of their love refuses to be denied, leading to a dramatic and tragic conclusion.",
