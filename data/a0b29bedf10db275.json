    "text": "Sinnosuke Sato's sound effects accompany a young boy's quest to find his missing father in a railway station where time operates in peculiar ways. Guided by a cryptic projectionist and a dedicated station master, the trio delves into the enigmatic events that unfold in this place where trains and timelines intersect. The boy's journey uncovers a tale of a projectionist who wields the power to control time through his films and a child who gazes into the past. With Tom Nagae producing and Tohru Okada as the music producer, this anime, directed and scripted by Tayuta Mikage, promises an enthralling adventure that blurs the boundaries of time.",
