    "text": "Toby, the beloved son of the brilliant scientist Dr. Tenma, meets an untimely end, pushing the grief-stricken father to create an android replica of the boy. The android, named Astro Boy, is endowed with advanced technology and a heart full of innocence. However, when Dr. Tenma realizes that Astro Boy cannot age like a human, he casts him aside. Astro Boy is then whisked away to a robot circus in America, where he is subjected to harsh treatment.\n\nFortunately, the benevolent Dr. Ochanomizu steps in, rescuing Astro Boy and nurturing his extraordinary abilities. Renamed Tetsuwan Atom, Astro Boy becomes a beacon of hope in a futuristic world where machines have become an integral part of society, often leading to political and social unrest. Despite his pacifist views and childlike naivety, Atom finds himself at the forefront of numerous battles against various factions, fighting for justice and peace.\n\nIn his journey, Atom grapples with the harsh realities of a world that views robots as inferior, striving to gain acceptance and find his place in society. With Dr. Ochanomizu's guidance, Atom learns to harness his powers, transforming into a crime-fighting hero who strives to protect both humans and robots alike, aiming to become the greatest hero the world has ever seen.",
