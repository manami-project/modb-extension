    "text": "Two years after the Tendoshuu's invasion, Gintoki Sakata, along with his former childhood friends Katsura and Takasugi, prepare for the final battle against their former master, the immortal Utsuro. The Tendoshuu, seeking to drain the last of the Altana resources from Earth, have returned and crashed their ship into the O-Edo Central Terminal, where a large amount of Altana is leaking. As the Tendoshuu army falls under Utsuro's influence, Gintoki and his allies rush to the terminal to stop them.\n\nGintama: THE FINAL is the third and final film adaptation of the Silver Soul arc, marking the series finale. With time running out and the Altana energy rapidly depleting, Gintoki and his friends must face their past and confront their former teacher in an emotional and action-packed showdown. Joined by many allies, including the Shinsengumi and the Yorozuya, the group fights to save not only Edo, but the entire world from the Tendoshuu's destructive plans. Will Gintoki and his friends be able to defeat Utsuro once and for all, and fulfill the wishes of their beloved teacher, Shouyou Yoshida? The final battle begins now.",
