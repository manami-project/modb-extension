    "text": "Ryou Fujihashi is going about her ordinary office job when she finds herself trapped in her burning apartment. The fire department arrives just in time to rescue her. To Ryou's surprise, one of the firefighters is her childhood friend Souma Mizuno, who she used to have a crush on. With Ryou now homeless after losing all her possessions, Souma generously opens his home to her. Living together rekindles old feelings between them, but Ryou knows she must be cautious of Souma's playboy ways. Yet his persistent romantic interest causes her to wonder if he is truly serious this time. As they spend more time together, Ryou must decide whether to let the flames of an old love reignite or build up defenses against Souma's charms.",
