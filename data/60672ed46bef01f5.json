    "text": "The office life of Fujihashi Ryo is mundane compared to the thrilling profession of her childhood friend, Mizuno Souma, a dashing firefighter. Attempting to set Souma up with a coworker proves futile, as she discovers his affection lies elsewhere - with her. A fateful fire in her apartment sparks a new chapter in their relationship when Souma comes to her rescue, offering his home as a temporary refuge. As they navigate living together, old feelings resurface, and Ryo finds herself drawn to Souma's charm. However, she must tread carefully to avoid falling for his womanizing ways and the allure of his attractive firefighter colleagues. Will the flames of their past love reignite, or will Ryo manage to keep her heart in check?",
