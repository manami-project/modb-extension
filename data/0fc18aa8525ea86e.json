    "text": "Juetian Cliff couldn't claim Nie Feng's life, instead, it granted him a second chance. Born with the rare True Yang body, Feng was destined for greatness, but his humble origins and tumultuous fate led him down a path of solitude, pitting him against the formidable eight major sects. Oppressed and betrayed, he leaped off the cliff in a desperate bid for survival. Reborn as a seventeen-year-old boy, Feng retains his unparalleled martial arts prowess and rises swiftly through the ranks, leaving his ordinary background behind. Determined to right the wrongs of his past life, Feng seeks vengeance on those who once stood against him, burying his enemies and making amends for his regrets.",
