  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around twins Misaki Fujioka and Mei Misaki in the sleepy town of Yomiyama City. The story takes place shortly before the start of a new school semester, as the carefree twins spend the last days of summer vacation together. We see glimpses into the twins' close relationship as they wander around town visiting places like the shopping center, shooting stall, and amusement park. However, there are ominous signs that their joyful days together may soon meet a tragic end. Mei has the mysterious ability to see death, and she senses impending calamity relating to her new class at school. There are also references to the class being cursed. Most disturbingly, Mei sees the color of death on her dear sister Misaki. With tragedy looming, the peaceful summer days take on an air of foreboding. The stage is set for a suspenseful and dramatic term at Yomiyama North Middle School Class 3-3.",
