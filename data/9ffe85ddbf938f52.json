    "text": "Company AMB, a pioneer in the electronics industry, introduces an innovative concept called \"Moe Therapy\" in the near future. This unique therapy employs bishoujo androids as an alternative to traditional animal therapy. To promote this groundbreaking idea, the company hires two Navi Girls, Kiyan Chie and Anna Moeki, who are tasked with public relations during this thrilling phase.\n\nIn the midst of their work, the duo finds themselves testing an extraordinary new service called \"Moe Can Change.\" This quirky service, developed for mobile phones, allows users to instantly change their outfits using just a smartphone. As Kiyan and Anna explore the possibilities of this intriguing technology, they also forge a bond with each other.\n\nThe anime adaptation, \"Moe Can Change!\", is based on a free-to-play game developed by Ambition for mobile devices. In the game, players join a beta test program for androids, taking on the role of caretakers and fashion stylists for these android girls. Frontier Works brings this engaging concept to life in the OVA adaptation, inviting viewers to dive into a world where technology, fashion, and friendship intertwine.",
