The jewel is hidden aboard the Royal Express luxury train, where the Queen is traveling from Tokyo to Osaka. Kaitou Kid's plan to steal the gem is complicated by the presence of Conan Edogawa, who suspects the thief's intentions and begins his own investigation. Meanwhile, Inspector Ginzou Nakamori prepares for a showdown with the elusive thief. Adding to the challenge, a criminal duo also has their eyes on the topaz and plans to eliminate the Queen.
