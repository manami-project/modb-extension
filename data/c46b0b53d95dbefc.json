    "text": "Sakura Kinomoto's life is turned upside down when she discovers the magical Clow Cards. Though now tasked with capturing the escaped cards, Sakura still finds time to have fun with her best friend Tomoyo and their classmates. Together they create a TV opening theme song and enjoy baking sweets. Sakura's rival Syaoran joins the friend group, along with his cousin Meiling. Their tall-tale-telling classmate Yamazaki often spins fanciful lies, but Sakura and friends learn his stories hide kernels of truth when told with eyes wide open. Despite the chaos of her duties as a fledgling Cardcaptor, Sakura cherishes the special moments shared with her loving circle of friends.",
