  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime 'Nasu: Summer in Andalusia' follows Pepe Benengeli, a Spanish cyclist competing in the prestigious Vuelta a Espa√±a cycling race, which is reminiscent of the Tour de France. As a support rider for his team, Pepe's role is to help his team's top rider secure the overall victory. However, as the race progresses, Pepe finds himself at a crossroads when the race route passes through his hometown in Andalusia on the same day as his elder brother's wedding to his ex-girlfriend, Carmen.\n\nDirected by Kosaka Kitaro, a renowned Studio Ghibli collaborator, the film showcases Pepe's struggles as he grapples with the reality of his stagnant cycling career and the painful reminder of his past love. With the threat of being dropped by his sponsor and the emotional turmoil of his brother's wedding, Pepe decides to take control of his destiny and aim for a personal victory in the race.\n\nSet against the backdrop of the sun-drenched Andalusian landscape, Pepe embarks on a grueling and pivotal journey that could potentially define his career and self-worth. The film beautifully captures the majestic beauty of Andalusia's arid terrain and the intensity of Pepe's determination to emerge victorious against all odds.",
