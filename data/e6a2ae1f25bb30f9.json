    "text": "His mother's blindness and a secret lineage shape the destiny of Arion, a young shepherd from Thrace, who is spirited away to the Underworld by Hades. Raised to become an unstoppable warrior, Arion's purpose is to exact vengeance on Zeus, the god responsible for his mother's curse. As he ascends from the depths of the Underworld, Arion forms unexpected alliances with a colossal ape-like creature named Geedo and a cunning thief called Seneca.\n\nArion's journey leads him to cross paths with powerful gods, including Athena, daughter of Zeus, and the manipulative Apollo. As the forces of Zeus and Poseidon clash, Arion must navigate the treacherous world of gods and men, fueled by his desire to lift his mother's curse and uncover the truth behind his own identity. With his newfound friends by his side, Arion faces formidable foes and uncovers hidden secrets, as he marches towards an epic confrontation with the mighty Zeus on Mount Olympus.",
