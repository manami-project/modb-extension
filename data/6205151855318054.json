  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyousuke Kano was once a passionate football player with dreams of going pro. However, constantly being compared to his older brother Seisuke - a football star playing for AC Milan - took its toll. Feeling he could never measure up, Kyousuke quit football altogether upon entering high school. Yet fate brings the sport back into his life when he's forced to coach the girls' football team at his new school. Though reluctant at first, Kyousuke soon rediscovers his love for the game. Joining the boys' team with his friends Rodrigo and Sakai, he sets his sights on the national tournament - and on becoming the best striker in Japan. With a rekindled passion for football, Kyousuke now strives to lead his team to victory on the national stage. Win or lose, he's determined to step out from his brother's shadow and forge his own path - both on and off the pitch.",
