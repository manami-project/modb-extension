  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the outskirts of town stands an abandoned mansion rumored to be haunted by ghosts. One day, Hiroshi and his friends Takuro, Takeshi, and Mika decide to visit the mansion as a test of courage. However, upon entering, they are attacked by a bizarre blue monster known as the Ao Oni (Blue Devil). Trapped inside the mansion, Hiroshi and his friends must now attempt to solve a series of riddles and puzzles in order to escape. All the while, the mischievous Ao Oni continues to attack and play tricks on them. Each time they fail to solve a puzzle, they are met with a \"hilarious\" demise, only to be revived to try again. Will Hiroshi and his classmates outwit the Ao Oni and make their way out of the mansion? Or are they doomed to an eternity of being the Blue Devil's playthings? Their courage and wits are put to the ultimate test in this comedic take on a haunted house story. With the familiar characters rendered in a cute, super-deformed art style, this adaptation promises laughs and jumps in equal measure as the Ao Oni's games continue even after death.",
