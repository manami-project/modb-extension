    "text": "As the whispers of local legends echo through the halls of their high school, Hiroshi and his friends—Takuro, Takeshi, and Mika—find themselves drawn to the eerie allure of an abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town. Rumored to be haunted by ghosts and monsters, the group decides to put their courage to the test and explore the mysterious dwelling. However, their bravery is soon met with the unexpected: a bizarre blue creature known as the Ao Oni.\n\nTrapped within the mansion's walls, the friends are forced to confront a series of riddles and puzzles in order to escape the clutches of their newfound tormentor. Will they succeed in outsmarting the Ao Oni and making their way back to safety, or will they succumb to a life of hilarious chaos, forever bound to the whims of their blue devil?\n\nPrepare for a comedic twist on the classic horror tale as these four friends embark on a daring adventure filled with laughter, wit, and super-deformed antics in Ao Oni ~The Animation~. As they navigate the treacherous halls of the haunted mansion, they'll discover that sometimes, the most entertaining stories are the ones that come to life after death.",
