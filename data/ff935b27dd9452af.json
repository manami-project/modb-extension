  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is based on the popular MMORPG, Phantasy Star Online 2, and covers the first three episodes of the game, along with original content. The story follows the members of ARKS, an organization dedicated to exploring new planets for the colony fleet Oracle. As they defend against the monstrous Darkers, controlled by the sinister Dark Falzes, they uncover secrets about their own organization and the planets they explore. In the first episode, the protagonist and fellow trainee Afin are attacked by Darkers during their qualification exam on planet Naberius. They discover a mysterious girl with lost memories and uncover the truth about the recent increase in Darker activity. In the second episode, the protagonist and Matoi investigate a dark conspiracy surrounding ARKS. In the third episode, the newly-reformed ARKS is tasked with investigating a sudden attack by the Kuronites on planet Harukotan, disturbing the peace with the Shironian. The truth behind the attack is more complex and terrifying than expected. The anime combines action, mystery, and sci-fi elements to create an engaging and thrilling experience.",
