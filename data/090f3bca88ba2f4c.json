    "text": "Yu ichiro Hyakuya, a young boy with a spirit unbroken by tragedy, is the focus of the anime special, \"Seraph of the End: Vampire Reign Special - The Beginning of the End.\" This special episode encapsulates the events of the anime's inaugural season.\n\nIn a world turned upside down, a lethal virus sweeps across the globe, claiming the lives of every human over the age of 13. Amidst this chaos, vampires rise from the shadows, seizing control and subjugating the remnants of humanity. Among the captives are Yuichiro and his fellow orphans, who are treated as mere livestock by their vampire overlords.\n\nDespite the grim circumstances, Yuichiro nurtures a grand ambition. He yearns to eradicate every last vampire, fueled by a lifetime of adversity. A failed escape attempt and the loss of his family only strengthen his resolve. However, fate has another cruel twist in store. Yuichiro discovers that Mikaela, a cherished figure, has been transformed into a vampire, further fueling his thirst for vengeance.",
