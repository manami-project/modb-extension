Yuuichirou and the other orphans from his home barely survive capture by the vampires, who treat them as livestock. Despite the tragedy and loss Yuuichirou has endured, including a failed escape plan and the deaths of his makeshift family, he refuses to give up. Instead, he vows revenge, harboring dreams of one day killing the vampires that took everything from him. However, Yuuichirou suffers yet another devastating blow upon learning his best friend Mikaela has become the very thing he seeks to destroy - a vampire. Though the odds seem hopeless, Yuuichirou's spirit remains unbroken as he continues pursuing his quest for vengeance.",
