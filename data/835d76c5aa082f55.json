  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kurou Kumogakure, a seemingly lazy and unmotivated 17-year-old, is one of the many ninjas who have secretly existed in Japan since the end of the Pacific War. Despite their official extinction, these skilled assassins now serve the government, with over 20,000 operating covertly in various domestic and international affairs.\n\nKurou, who has been living an unremarkable life as a NEET since his clan's demise, is unexpectedly assigned to infiltrate a local high school. His mission: to obtain crucial information that is essential for the nation's defense. As he navigates the challenges of everyday school life, he must keep his true identity hidden and face the unexpected complexities of his assignment.\n\nMeanwhile, the Allied Command in Japan has developed an agency to manage terrorism and violence within the Pacific region. Staffed with ninjas like Kurou, the agency has grown to manage a vast network of covert operatives. As Tokyo faces a potential surge in foreign assassins, Kurou's unassuming demeanor might just be the last line of defense against the impending threat.",
