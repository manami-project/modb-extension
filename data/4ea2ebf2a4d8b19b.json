  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is 1969 in Tokyo, Japan. The country is recovering from the devastation of World War II, yet faces a new threat - mysterious invaders who threaten to destroy Japan with guerrilla warfare. To combat this, a secret organization called AEGIS has discovered special teenagers with the ability to open dimensional portals called “Gates”. These empower the teens with elemental abilities needed to fight the invaders. They are known as “Gatekeepers”. One such teenager is Shun Ukiya, an average high school student. On his way home, Shun witnesses invaders approaching and desperately unlocks his own Gate ability to protect his family. This catches the attention of childhood friend Ruriko Ikusawa, a member of AEGIS tasked with recruiting gifted teens like Shun. As one of the only forces capable of saving humanity, Shun joins AEGIS and the Gatekeepers in covertly fighting against the vicious alien invaders infesting Tokyo and threatening the world. With new allies and abilities, he works to unlock the full potential of his Gate while hiding the secret from the public and avoiding the mistakes of his estranged late father.",
