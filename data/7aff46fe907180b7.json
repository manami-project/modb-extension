  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the journey of Sakon Tachibana, a shy and self-conscious Bunraku puppeteer, and his unique puppet, Ukon. Sakon is the sole grandson of a renowned puppet master and carries on the family tradition with a twist: he is a talented ventriloquist. Together with Ukon, a charming yet audacious puppet crafted in the Meiji era by the esteemed Unosuke Koizumi III, they traverse Japan, solving complex mysteries and gruesome murders.\n\nSakon's timid demeanor transforms when he is with Ukon, allowing him to hone in on his crime-solving abilities. Ukon, in contrast to the typical Bunraku puppet, is outgoing, boisterous, and self-centered. Despite their differences, the duo shares a strong bond and works together to unravel intricate cases, often forcing confessions from the culprits.\n\nAs they delve deeper into the world of crime-solving, Sakon and Ukon are aided by Kaoruko, Sakon's attractive and dedicated police detective aunt. Kaoruko not only supports them but also keeps a watchful eye on her nephew. With their combined skills and unique talents, this unlikely trio tackles horrific crimes, revenge plots, and malicious acts, all while navigating the complexities of human nature and the art of puppetry.",
