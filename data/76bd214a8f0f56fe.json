  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Her name is Ichigo, a young fourth-grader caught in the middle of her parents' strained relationship. Living with her kind-hearted mother and her less-than-affectionate stepfather, she yearns for a time when love and harmony filled their home. One day, an enchanting encounter with a magical bus driver grants her a wish: to meet her real father.\n\nTransported back in time to her father's apartment, Ichigo finds herself in the role of her father's younger sister. With the opportunity to change her family's destiny, she embarks on a mission to unite her biological parents. But it's not as simple as she thought. Kyousuke, her real father, is a shy and bumbling man, while Yuuji, his rival, is confident and outgoing.\n\nAs Ichigo navigates the complexities of love and relationships in the past, she strives to ensure that her real father wins her mother's heart. The fate of her family rests in her hands, and only time will tell if her actions will lead to a future filled with love and happiness.",
