  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During the holidays, Yuuta decides to leave St. Alfonso Academy, a remote boarding school on an island, to visit Japan. There, he unexpectedly runs into his classmate Haruya Kobayashi. In another coincidence, his friends Henri-Hugues, Alfred and others from the academy have also come to Japan on holiday. As the classmates reunite outside of school, they speculate whether it's purely by chance that they are all spending their vacations in the same place. Later, while in the city, Keita and the other Marginal Prince encounter Keita's sister. Their encounter offers a glimpse into Keita's family life outside of the academy. Clearly, there is more connecting these students than their time together at St. Alfonso. As their lives intersect over the holidays, there promises to be surprises and revelations about the bonds between the Marginal Prince and their circles.",
