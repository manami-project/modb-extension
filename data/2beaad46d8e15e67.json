  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Prince Yuuta, a student at the prestigious St. Alfonso Academy, seizes the opportunity to escape the confines of his remote island boarding school during the holidays, eager to explore the bustling streets of Japan. In an unexpected twist of fate, he crosses paths with his former classmate, Haruya Kobayashi. But the surprises don't end there, as Yuuta discovers that his fellow academy companions, including the enigmatic Henri-Hugues and charismatic Alfred, have also chosen Japan as their holiday destination. Could this be mere coincidence, or is there more to their simultaneous presence than meets the eye?\n\nMeanwhile, Keita and the rest of the Marginal Prince find themselves far from the familiar halls of St. Alphonso Academy, venturing into the cityscape where they are introduced to an important figure in Keita's life - his sister. This extra episode, released alongside the 7th DVD volume, unveils a deeper layer to the Marginal Prince's world, as they navigate the complexities of family ties and friendship.",
