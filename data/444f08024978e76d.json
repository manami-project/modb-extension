    "text": "Deathâ€™s-Head looms large in Otomo City, a metropolis where justice is a distant memory and conspiracy thrives. The Skull Man, a living embodiment of death, stalks the city's underbelly, leaving a trail of carnage in his wake, even among the grotesque mutants that inhabit the city's darkest corners.\n\nFreelance journalist Minagami Hayato returns to his hometown, Otomo City, to investigate a series of bizarre murders, all linked to a man donning a skull mask. As he delves deeper into the city's grim realities, he uncovers a web of connections between the victims, a local pharmaceutical company, and a new religious sect.\n\nHayato teams up with a young photographer, Kiriko Mamiya, to unmask the true identity of the Skull Man. Their pursuit leads them through a decaying city riddled with corruption, where the sins of the ruling elite run as deep as the city's rivers.\n\nIn this chilling necropolis where nothing is as it appears, vengeance takes the form of a living Death's-Head. As Hayato and Kiriko navigate the city's treacherous underworld, they unearth a shocking secret so profound that an entire city has been transformed into a tomb to contain it. Will they survive the nightmarish truth, or become the next victims of the Skull Man?",
