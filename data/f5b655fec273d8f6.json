    "text": "Monochrome's reign is the dream of Miss Monochrome, a virtual singer and original character conceptualized by the talented seiyuu Horie Yui. Making her debut at Horie's 2012 concert, 'Horie Yui wo Meguru Bouken III ~Secret Mission Tour~', this 3D character has since graced an array of merchandise and the social network game 'Girlfriend (Beta)'. With a deep-seated love for monochrome hues and a strong aversion to color, Miss Monochrome's ultimate goal is to transform the world into her beloved black and white palette.\n\nAs we delve into the third season, Miss Monochrome's journey to becoming Japan's most sought-after idol intensifies. With the support of the idol group Caramel, she tirelessly hones her skills and promotes her upcoming live tour. As the highly anticipated tour commences, the question lingers - how will her devoted fans respond to her monochrome vision?",
