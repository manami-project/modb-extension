    "text": "Jeanneâ€™s legacy lives on in the modern world as Maron Kusakabe, an ordinary high school student by day and a divine thief by night. Reincarnated from the heroic Joan of Arc, Maron is tasked with a mission to protect humanity from the clutches of demons hiding in artistic masterpieces. Guided by the angelic Fin Fish, she embarks on a quest to seal these malevolent forces, preventing them from corrupting innocent souls.\n\nMaron's best friend, Miyako, remains oblivious to her secret identity, despite being the daughter of a detective hell-bent on capturing the elusive thief. The arrival of a new classmate and neighbor, Chiaki, further complicates Maron's life. Not only does he compete for her affections, but he also emerges as a rival in her nighttime endeavors, assuming the identity of the thief Sinbad.\n\nAs Maron navigates through the challenges of adolescence, she must also confront the supernatural forces that threaten the world. With her friends and the fate of humanity at stake, can Maron continue to safeguard the innocence of those around her while evading capture? Only time will tell if this divine thief can maintain the delicate balance between her everyday life and her extraordinary mission.",
