  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While commemorating Lupin's 50th Anniversary, this special episode unfolds with an invitation from the enigmatic Mr. X, luring Lupin into a treacherous race. Despite his allies' skepticism, Lupin's gaze is fixed on the elusive Golden Statue, nestled near the race's path. As the gang devises a strategy to seize the statue, Mr. X orchestrates a sinister scheme, catapulting Lupin back in time to manipulate pivotal moments that shape his bond with his crew. Meanwhile, Fujiko diverges from Lupin's path, intent on stealing the golden statue herself, only to be ensnared by Mr. X, who harbors a plot to annihilate both Lupin and Fujiko. Paying tribute to the inaugural episode of the original Lupin Sansei TV series, this OVA forms part of the Lupin Sansei 50th Anniversary Project, bundled with Volume 1 of Lupin Sansei: Part 5's BD/DVD.",
