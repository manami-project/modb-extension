    "text": "During summer vacation, Takato travels to Okinawa to visit his cousin Kai. There he meets a fellow Tamer named Minami, who has a partner Digimon. Back in Tokyo, a popular virtual pet computer program is somehow causing Digimon to become aggressive and attack humans. Takato enjoys his time in Okinawa with Kai, though keeping Guilmon a secret proves challenging. An incident reveals the existence of Digimon to Kai. Meanwhile in Tokyo, a brutal Digimon defeats Ruki's partner Renamon before wreaking havoc in the city. Upon returning to Tokyo, Takato learns that the attacks seem targeted specifically at Minami. He teams up with Ruki and Jenrya to investigate the virtual pet company behind the infections. They discover an evil digital entity has crossed into their world with sinister plans set in motion through the virtual pets. Takato and his friends must now stand together alongside their partner Digimon to face this threat.",
