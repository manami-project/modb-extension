  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cassell College, an enigmatic institution nestled in the heart of Chicago, extends an unexpected invitation to Lu Mingfei, an ordinary high school student with a penchant for Starcraft. Initially skeptical of the offer, Lu Mingfei's curiosity eventually propels him into a realm where the existence of dragons is not a mere myth but a tangible reality. As he navigates through the labyrinth of college life, Lu Mingfei's unremarkable existence undergoes a seismic shift, catapulting him into an extraordinary journey of dragon slaying. Unbeknownst to him, his decision to accept the admission letter marks the inception of his quest to ascend the throne, forging bonds of friendship and love, and cultivating personal growth along the way. This is a tale of a young man's metamorphosis in a world where the echoes of history reverberate with the roars of dragons and the valiant efforts of generations past.",
