  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rin and Luvia embark on a clandestine mission at a hot springs inn, coinciding with Sella's family getaway won through a short trip giveaway. The Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya crew joins them, but Kuro encounters an unexpected issue: the hot springs seem to deplete her mana at an alarming rate. What hidden secret could be causing this peculiar drain? This magical girl anime is based on Hiroyama Hiroshi's manga, which is a spin-off of Type-Moon's Fate/stay night erotic visual novel. Originally bundled with the limited edition of the sixth Fate/Kaleid Liner Prisma Illya 3rei!! manga volume, this fanservice OVA offers a unique and entertaining experience.",
