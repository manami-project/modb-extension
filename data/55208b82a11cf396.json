    "text": "Kizuna Todoroki is a 13-year-old girl who practices the Wadachi Ju-ken fighting style. She enters and wins the 10th Annual World Martial Arts Championship, defeating the reigning champion Everest Choyama. However, it is revealed that Kizuna is actually two days away from turning 13, making her ineligible to compete. After learning of this, Everest challenges any fighter to defeat Kizuna before her birthday in order to claim the championship title. Suddenly, Kizuna finds herself fending off countless challengers arriving at her family's dojo. During this chaos, a journalist named Hanaka visits the Todoroki household to interview Kizuna about her fighting skills and family history with the Wadachi Ju-ken martial art. As Kizuna continues battling opponent after opponent, Hanaka learns more about the young prodigy and the debt her grandfather accrued that she paid off with her tournament prize money. Kizuna must now fight to defend her title against an onslaught of rival fighters while also sharing the story of her family's dojo with the visiting reporter.",
