    "text": "Remi is an eight-year-old orphan boy living happily with his mother in the French countryside. Their lives change dramatically when Remi's estranged father, Jerome, returns home desperate for money. He shockingly reveals Remi is adopted and sells the boy to Vitalis, a traveling street entertainer. Now part of Vitalis's troupe of performing animals, Remi journeys across France in search of his real parents. Along the way, he faces the harsh realities of life as he experiences tragic loss, fleeting friendships, makeshift families torn apart, abuse, abandonment, and mistreatment. Despite the hardships, Remi persists in pursuing happiness and searching for where he truly belongs in an unforgiving world. This deeply emotional story explores the timeless themes of friendship, family, identity, and the human capacity to endure. As Remi encounters cruelty but also kindness on the road, he comes to learn the bittersweet lessons that shape one's passage into adulthood.",
