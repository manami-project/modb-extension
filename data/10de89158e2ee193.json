    "text": "Rokuro \"Rock\" Okajima is a Japanese salaryman working for a large corporation in Tokyo. During a routine business trip to deliver important documents in Southeast Asia, his ship is attacked by the Lagoon Company, a ruthless band of pirate mercenaries operating out of the lawless town of Roanapur. Although initially taken hostage for ransom money, Rock is abandoned by his cold-hearted employers who refuse to pay. Impressed by his resilience and adaptability, the Lagoon Company decides to recruit Rock. Now a member of the underground criminal organization, Rock struggles to retain his morality and humanity amidst the corruption, violence, and seedy dealings of his new life. His brash colleague Revy constantly tests his nerves as the Lagoon Company carries out illegal operations and gun-for-hire missions for various crime syndicates. With more than just profit on the line, Rock walks a delicate tightrope in balancing his personal values while getting the gritty work done. Witness his transformation from average businessman to hardened mercenary as he fights to survive the tribulations of Roanapur and keep his sanity intact.",
