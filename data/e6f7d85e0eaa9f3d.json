    "text": "Animation graduate Kaori Iwase from Tokyo University of the Arts presents a poignant tale of a stranded catfish duo in her 2014 project. The story revolves around a large catfish, trapped on a riverbank, and its smaller companion, living in a boat filled with nostalgic mementos from their ocean home. With original music by Kaoru Kubota and sound effects by Satsuki Sato, this touching narrative explores their quiet life together, while they yearn for the sea they cannot return to. Produced by Mitsuko Okamoto, this heartwarming animation is bound to leave a lasting impression.",
