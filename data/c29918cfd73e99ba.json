    "text": "At the heart of a world brimming with covert wars and underhanded politics, an unrivaled spy known as Twilight is entrusted with a mission unlike any other: to form a family. Working under the guise of Loid Forger, a respected psychiatrist, Twilight's objective is to infiltrate an elite school attended by the son of a high-ranking Ostanian politician, Donovan Desmond, who poses a threat to the fragile peace between Ostania and Westalis.\n\nIn order to blend seamlessly into the world of social gatherings and school events, Twilight must assemble a family in record time. His search leads him to Yor, an unsuspecting office worker with a hidden life as a deadly assassin known as the Thorn Princess, and Anya, a seemingly ordinary orphan with the extraordinary ability to read minds.\n\nWith the fate of world peace hanging in the balance, this unlikely trio must navigate the challenges of their new life together, each concealing their true identities while learning to trust one another. As they embark on this unpredictable journey, they discover that the bonds of family might just be the most powerful weapon they have.",
