    "text": "Because of his unique physical characteristics, Inu-Oh is forced to conceal his body and face with masks and garments. One day, he encounters Tomona, a blind biwa player, whose music ignites Inu-Oh's passion for dancing. Together, they perform and captivate audiences, gradually gaining fame and notoriety. As Inu-Oh evolves with each performance, Tomona questions the cause of his blindness. Based on Hideo Furukawa's novel, this musical fantasy film tells the story of the legendary 14th-century Sarugaku Noh performer Inu-Oh and his bond with Tomona, as they challenge societal norms and defy fate through their creative talents. With spectacular music and dance sequences, this rock operetta explores the mystery behind Tomona's blindness and Inu-Oh's unique appearance while showcasing their unbreakable friendship.",
