    "text": "Modern-day biker gangs engage in a power struggle for control over a local petrol station, forming and dissolving alliances in a scene reminiscent of Japan's 16th-century civil war. Based on Jiro Ueno's manga, this anime follows the story of the notorious bosozoku gang, Specter, once led by the young and powerful Shimada Eiji. However, when Shimada is sent to reform school, the leadership is passed on to Kagami, marking the beginning of a tumultuous Warring States era for the biker gangs of Kanto. As a rival gang emerges in Kanagawa, the stage is set for a thrilling showdown between modern-day warriors on wheels.",
