    "text": "In the year 2201, mankind has made great technological advancements like high-speed anti-gravity racing machines used in the popular F-Zero races across the universe. However, this progress has also led to a growing divide between rich and poor. Amidst the frenzy over these dangerous races, the criminal organization Dark Million led by Black Shadow and Deathborn seeks to secure prize money for nefarious plans. To counter them, Jody Summer and Dr. Stewart recruit the revived Rick Wheeler, once a detective in 2051 before being put in cold sleep after an accident while chasing the criminal Zoda. Together with other heroic racers, Rick fights in F-Zero races to keep the prize money from Dark Million and uphold justice in the galaxy.",
