    "text": "Ichijou Hikaru, a skilled fighter pilot, finds himself aboard the spacecraft Macross, light-years away from a war-torn Earth. Engaged in a relentless conflict with the colossal alien races, the Zentradi and Meltrandi, Hikaru unexpectedly becomes the operator of a transformed mecha during a heated battle. Amidst the chaos, he crosses paths with the charismatic city idol, Minmay Lynn, sparking an intimate connection that faces disapproval due to her status and fame.\n\nAs the Macross navigates its way back to Earth, Hikaru and his comrades continue their desperate fight against the enigmatic adversaries. Meanwhile, Hikaru and Minmay struggle to maintain their bond amidst the turmoil. Unbeknownst to them, Minmay's heartfelt music holds the potential key to ending the bloodshed and restoring peace.\n\nIn this three-way interstellar war, the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. As the remnants of civilization face annihilation, only an ancient song and Minmay's voice can determine the outcome. Hikaru, torn between his love for Minmay and his duty to protect mankind, must embark on a perilous journey to find her and make a decision that could change the course of the galaxy.",
