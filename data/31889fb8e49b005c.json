  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japan's Monster Academy is not your average school, and Shushu is not your average student. Raised to believe she was a boy, Shushu's world is rocked when her father reveals the truth: she is, in fact, a girl. Despite this, Shushu is determined to become a wereman and enrolls in Monster Academy to achieve her dream. Little does she know, her secret won't stay hidden for long.\n\nAs she navigates the challenges of her new school, Shushu crosses paths with Juzu, the enigmatic son of the school's founder. Feared by his peers and known for his taciturn demeanor, Juzu is not what he seems. When Shushu's secret is exposed, she discovers that Juzu is kind-hearted, a bit slow, and in search of a friend.\n\nWith the spotlight on Shushu and Juzu, the quiet life Shushu desired slips away. Alongside a colorful cast of characters, including their dorm head Timido, class representative Kiisu Fraigaa, and Kiisu's teddy bear sidekick Bear-tan, Shushu and Juzu must navigate the trials and tribulations of Monster Academy together. Join them on their journey in this exciting anime, with new episodes streaming from December 4, 2014, to celebrate the release of the manga's first compiled book volume.",
