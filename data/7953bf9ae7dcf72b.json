    "text": "Concerned by the loss of his unique musical spark after his grandfather's passing, aspiring shamisen player Setsu Sawamura leaves his quaint village for the bustling metropolis of Tokyo. Struggling to adapt to the deafening city life, Setsu encounters Yuna, a hostess with acting ambitions, and is later coerced by his estranged mother, Umeko, to enroll at Umezono Academy.\n\nAt the academy, Setsu meets Shuri Maeda, a fellow shamisen enthusiast who dreams of performing a song her grandmother once heard from Setsu's legendary grandfather. As Setsu becomes increasingly involved with Shuri's shamisen appreciation club, he embarks on a journey to rediscover his passion for the instrument and develop his own unique sound.\n\nWhile navigating the challenges of high school and the cacophony of Tokyo, Setsu's life intertwines with those of his newfound friends, each with their own dreams and aspirations. As they support one another, Setsu finds himself inching closer to filling the void left by his grandfather's passing and embracing the unique sound that lies within him.",
