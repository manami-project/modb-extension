    "text": "The anime tells the story of Prince Rama, the eldest son of King Dasharatha of Ayodhya. Rama is exiled to the forest for 14 years due to palace intrigue. Accompanied by his wife Sita and brother Lakshman, Rama faces many challenges during his exile. The demon king Ravana then kidnaps Sita, sparking a conflict between Rama and Ravana's armies. Rama builds an army of monkeys and forest creatures to battle Ravana's forces. During a fierce fight, Lakshman is seriously injured, but is saved when Hanuman brings healing herbs from the Himalayas. Rama ultimately rescues Sita and defeats Ravana using powerful heavenly weapons. They return triumphantly to Ayodhya, having overcome adversity through courage and righteousness. This epic story explores themes of love, trust, friendship and good versus evil. The anime features music and production elements from Indian cinema and classic literature. At over two hours long, it promises to be a thrilling theatrical spectacle.",
