However, a plot orchestrated by one of his father's wives leads to Rama's exile into the forest for 14 years. Accompanied by his devoted wife, Sita, and his loyal brother, Lakshman, Rama faces the challenges of life in the wilderness. Meanwhile, the ruthless demon king Ravana, enamored by Sita's beauty, cunningly abducts her and takes her to his kingdom in Lanka. Heartbroken, Rama embarks on a perilous journey to rescue his beloved wife, aided by an army of monkeys and other forest friends. In the ensuing battle, Rama's forces confront Ravana's powerful army, with the fate of Sita and the future of Ayodhya hanging in the balance.
