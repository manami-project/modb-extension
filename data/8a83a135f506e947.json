    "text": "Arisa Minase is a high school girl who lives a happy life with her family and friends. On the night before her birthday, after a conversation with her beloved brother, she mysteriously finds herself transported to a strange realm called Wonderland. In Wonderland, Arisa is greeted by unusual characters who insist on calling her Alice and seem to know her from a past visit. Confused, she meets the kind Black Rabbit who explains that she is trapped in an endless time loop where every day repeats. As she adjusts, Arisa discovers all the Wonderland inhabitants resemble people from her real life, yet strangely, none recognize her. There seems to be no escape from the repetitive days. Arisa realizes that in order to break the cycle and return home, she must uncover the secrets of Wonderland and find the true Alice known to its residents. Her adventures will lead her to peculiar personalities like the Cheshire Cat and dormouse Round, while trying to solve the mystery behind the time loop. Though Wonderland appears whimsical, Arisa senses there are darker truths beneath the surface. Will she choose to stay or find a way back to the life and loved ones she knew? Her journey has just begun.",
