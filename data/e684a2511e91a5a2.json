  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Things are far from ordinary for Mahiro, who finds himself in the midst of an eccentric protection squad composed of Nyaruko, Kuko, and Hasuta. As Nyaruko and Tamao join forces to captivate Mahiro, Kuko reassesses her own love life. The group faces challenges ranging from a menacing monkey and a surprising guest from Kuko's past to juggling love, responsibilities, and the inevitable task of saving the world.\n\nAmidst these escapades, Nyaruko persistently tries to win Mahiro's heart while involving him in adventures connected to the Cthulhu mythos. Meanwhile, Hasuta remains smitten with Mahiro, and Kuko desires to share Nyaruko and Mahiro's first romantic experiences. Yoriko, the ever-cheerful caretaker, manages their chaotic household. Mahiro, however, craves normalcy and is reluctant to become romantically entangled with a Nyarlathotepan, Cthughan, or a Hasturan. Will he be able to resist the romantic pursuits of his protectors? Only time will tell.",
