    "text": "The anime follows the adventures of five female space pirates who pilot an advanced starship called the Sol Bianca. Seeking riches and revenge, they travel across the galaxy plundering valuable items and getting into dangerous situations. Their quest takes an interesting turn when a stowaway named Rim comes aboard, offering information on the location of the ultimate treasure - the legendary Gnosis artifact from Old Earth. However, the Gnosis is in the hands of the ruthless Emperor Batros who rules the planet Tres with an iron fist after militarily occupying the neighboring world of Uno. Undeterred, the headstrong pirates hatch a daring plan to steal the priceless Gnosis using their ace-in-the-hole - an orbital sniper gun mounted on the Sol Bianca. Buckling up for the dangerous space heist of their lives, the crew of the advanced starship are about to risk it all for the greatest prize of all. Will they succeed in their perilous mission or will Emperor Batros and his forces thwart the notorious pirates? Their fate rides on luck, skill and their technologically unrivaled spaceship - the Sol Bianca!",
