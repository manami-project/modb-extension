    "text": "With a heart as vast as his muscular physique, Genzou Shibata, a professional wrestler and ardent animal lover, finds himself abruptly transported to a mystical realm. Tasked by a princess to eradicate the magical beasts plaguing her kingdom, Genzou's fury ignites. Instead of complying, he executes a powerful German suplex on the princess. Unable to return to his world, Genzou embarks on a tranquil life in this new realm, establishing a pet shop for magical creatures. Alongside his unique employees, including a wolf-girl and a semi-dragon girl, Genzou dedicates himself to fostering a culture of pet care and appreciation for these enchanting beasts.",
