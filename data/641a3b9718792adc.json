    "text": "Accounting departments, college entrance exams, and alien invasions collide in this thrilling anime! Dr. Kishida, a brilliant yet eccentric scientist, constructs the ultimate feminine fighting robot, ARIEL, to defend Earth from extraterrestrial invaders and their colossal monsters. However, his granddaughters, Aya, Mia, and Kazumi, are reluctant to take up the mantle of teenage superheroes, as they have their own lives to lead. Aya, focused on her studies, and Mia, dedicated to sports, have little interest in piloting ARIEL, while Kazumi is the only one who embraces the idea.\n\nAs the war reaches a stalemate, the invaders' accounting department raises concerns about escalating costs, and their enigmatic leader, Albert Houser, arrives to oversee operations. With Earth's fate hanging in the balance, Aya and her comrades must rise to the occasion and pilot ARIEL to thwart Houser's sinister plans. Meanwhile, a mysterious alien named Saber Starblast emerges, who may hold the key to defeating the invaders once and for all. Can Aya and her friends find the strength to save the world, or will they succumb to the pressures of their everyday lives and the impending alien threat? Join them on this extraordinary journey to protect Earth and discover the true power of ARIEL!",
