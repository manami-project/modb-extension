  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Izumi Masamune is a high school student and aspiring light novel author who writes stories but lacks artistic talent to illustrate them. His novels are illustrated by an anonymous artist using the pen name \"Eromanga-sensei\" who draws sexually suggestive artwork. Masamune lives with his younger step-sister Sagiri Izumi, a hikikomori who hasn't left her room for a year since their parents died. He cares for Sagiri while juggling school and his writing career, though she mostly stays in her room and orders him around. Through a surprising turn of events, Masamune discovers that his mysterious illustrator Eromanga-sensei is none other than his shut-in sister Sagiri. This revelation shocks their sibling relationship and also introduces romantic complications when a popular female light novel author becomes their rival. As Masamune and Sagiri now have to work together as author and illustrator while new challenges emerge, their sibling bond evolves and deepens. Sagiri also starts to open up and leave her shut-in lifestyle behind. The story follows the development of their relationship amidst the colorful light novel industry.",
