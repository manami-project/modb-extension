    "text": "From the mundane life of a typical high school student, Tomoharu Natsume's world takes a dramatic turn when he becomes the unwitting custodian of a mysterious and powerful artifact known as an Asura Machina. The supernatural entity, concealed within a locked briefcase, draws its strength from a human sacrifice - a sacrifice that turns out to be none other than Misao, the ghost of Tomoharu's childhood friend who has been faithfully following him around.\n\nAs the bearer of such a coveted power, Tomoharu finds himself in the crosshairs of various factions, including the Divine Guards, who seek to harness the Asura Machina for their own nefarious purposes. When a demon named Kanade becomes Tomoharu's ally and is subsequently captured by the Divine Guards, he joins the enigmatic Dark Society to rescue her and unravel the secrets surrounding the Asura Machina, Misao's connection to it, and why it possesses the power to alter the very fabric of their world.\n\nIn this thrilling and suspenseful tale, Tomoharu must navigate a complex web of supernatural intrigue, forge unlikely alliances, and confront formidable adversaries in a desperate bid to save his friends and restore balance to a world teetering on the brink of chaos.",
