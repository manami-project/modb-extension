In the early 21st century, a vampire named Duo faces a similar fate for revealing the secret to restoring 'purana,' the life-sustaining essence lost to a mysterious virus, to humanity. Duo's betrayal of his race has widened the rift between humans and vampires, plunging the world into chaos. Now, Duo is hunted by his former friend, Zieg, a powerful vampire torn between duty and his personal history with the traitor. Will Zieg execute Duo for his treachery or will their friendship sway his decision? The fate of humanity hangs in the balance in this gripping tale of loyalty, sacrifice, and redemption.",
