    "text": "It's a peaceful existence on the secluded island of Delmurin, home to an array of friendly monsters who were once under the control of the vanquished demon lord Hadlar. Among them is Dai, an aspiring young hero and the sole human inhabitant, raised by the benevolent monster Brass. Dai's ordinary life takes a dramatic turn when Hadlar is resurrected, now serving an even more formidable demon lord.\n\nIn the face of this new threat, the legendary hero Avan arrives to train Dai and his fellow student Pop. But when Hadlar attacks, Avan sacrifices himself to protect his students, unleashing a mysterious mark on Dai's forehead that grants him extraordinary powers, enabling him to repel Hadlar.\n\nDai and Pop embark on a perilous journey to avenge their fallen mentor and restore peace to their world. Their adventure takes a dire turn when a group of impostors, masquerading as heroes, invade Delmurin, wreaking havoc and kidnapping Dai's cherished friend, Gome-chan. It's now up to Dai to harness his newfound abilities and save his friend, setting the stage for a thrilling tale of courage, friendship, and the pursuit of justice.",
