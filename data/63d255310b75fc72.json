  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They call him the Black Cat, Train Heartnet, a ruthless assassin working for the clandestine organization Chronos, which secretly governs the world. As one of the top thirteen agents known as Chronos Numbers, Train executes missions with cold precision, until a fateful encounter with a bounty hunter named Saya. Her vibrant spirit and unique perspective on life prompt Train to question his own path, leading him to abandon his role as the Black Cat and pursue a new life as a Sweeper, a bounty hunter for good.\n\nTeaming up with his newfound partner Sven Vollfield and a living weapon named Eve, Train must navigate the dangerous world of bounty hunting while evading the grasp of his former employers. Chronos, determined to bring their once-deadly agent back into the fold, dispatches the other Erasers and the unhinged Creed Diskenth to track him down. As Train forges his new path, he must confront his past, protect his friends, and stay one step ahead of the powerful forces that seek to control him. In this thrilling adventure, Train discovers that the line between friend and foe is often blurred, and that the true meaning of justice may not be as black and white as it seems.",
