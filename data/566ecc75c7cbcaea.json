    "text": "Taking place in a post-apocalyptic world devastated by a nuclear war, humanity finds itself under the oppressive thumb of the World Empire. Stripped of their freedom and forbidden to possess any weapons, people live in despair. However, a glimmer of hope emerges in the form of a clandestine resistance team who defy the rules by wielding antique guns, now considered works of art. These antique guns manifest spirit incarnations known as 'Musketeers' who join the fight against the Empire's contemporary gun-wielding forces. By activating their powerful 'Absolute Noble' mode, the Musketeers strive to bring hope and freedom back to the world. Join this band of brave warriors as they navigate through laughter, pain, and unwavering loyalty in their quest to protect what truly matters.",
