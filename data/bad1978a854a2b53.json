The General Student Council serves as the overarching governing body, but their effectiveness has been severely compromised due to the inexplicable vanishing of the council president. As a result, a myriad of problems has started to plague the city. To prevent further chaos, the council seeks the aid of Schale, also known as the Federal Investigation Club. Schale, being the newest club and the last one approved prior to the president's disappearance, takes on the challenge under the mentorship of a seasoned Sensei. As they navigate through the complexities of Kivotos, they strive to resolve the escalating issues. In this thrilling anime, students are mandated to carry personal weapons and smartphones, offering a captivating blend of military action, camaraderie, and romance within the Academy City.
