    "text": "Bakugan Interspace has become a popular virtual reality battle arena where kids test their skills against top brawlers like Dan, Shun, and Marucho. However, an explosion of energy sends shockwaves across the galaxy, attracting the attention of two warring alien factions - the Gundalians and Neathians. These groups infiltrate Bakugan Interspace seeking to recruit powerful Earth brawlers to their causes. While the Gundalians of the evil Twelve Orders aim to destroy the peaceful Neathian homeland, the Neathians fight to defend their dimension. Soon the Battle Brawlers, including new allies Jake and Fabia, become entangled in this interdimensional war. With the stakes higher than ever, they must fight to keep Bakugan Interspace free of politics while also deciding whether to participate in the conflict that threatens Earth and the Bakugan race.",
