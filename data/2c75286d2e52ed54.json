    "text": "Kuwata's manga adaptation of Hirai's gripping tale, 8 Man, takes on new life as a thrilling anime series. A seasoned private detective, caught in the crosshairs of a seemingly ordinary case involving purloined technology, faces a brutal assault that leaves him clinging to life. In a desperate bid for survival, he relinquishes his humanity, transforming into 8Man, a formidable cyborg crime-fighter with a living human brain at its core. As the ultimate high-tech vigilante, 8Man rises from the ashes to enforce justice and quell the rising tide of violence.\n\nBut even death cannot conquer this extraordinary crimefighter. When the nefarious Saucer Lips eliminates police officer Peter Brady, he inadvertently creates his most formidable adversary, Tobor, the 8th Man. The relentless cycle of crime and retribution continues as 8Man seeks to bring lawlessness to an end, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. This classic animated thriller has also been adapted into a live-action movie, proving that 8Man's enduring appeal transcends mediums.",
