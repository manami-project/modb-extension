  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows a group of art students, Yuno, Sae, Hiro, Miyako, Nori and Nazuna, who live together at the Hidamari Apartments while attending a prestigious art school. During their summer break, the girls look to enjoy their time off from school. On a hot sunny day, they decide to visit an indoor swimming pool to cool down. Later, they have a fun sleepover pajama party at Hiro's apartment. On another nice day, they use a small plastic pool to wash the curtains outside their home. They also get treated to an all-you-can-eat barbecue dinner courtesy of their landlady. On a separate three-day weekend in July, the girls explore options on how to spend their time off. With pleasant sunny weather the next day, they decide to visit an open-air museum that has various statues and artwork on display. While life as art students involves a lot of hard work, the girls occasionally get some time to relax and bond with each other. Whether going out to explore or staying in for home activities, they find creative ways to make their time off engaging and fun.",
