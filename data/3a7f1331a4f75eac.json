Together, they form the 'Party' and navigate a treacherous world filled with underground fight clubs and axe-wielding demons. As Baron and his allies search for a cure, they must also endure the unpredictable antics of Ixia's magical exploits. Will they unlock the secret to lifting the curse and ensure their survival in this perilous realm?
