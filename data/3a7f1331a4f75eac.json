  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Thirteen years ago, the demon Kazan unleashed a cursed light across the land of Arad, transforming many of its denizens into demonic beings. One such victim was Baron, whose left arm became possessed. Seeking a cure, Baron now travels Arad accompanied by Roxy, the spirit residing in his sword, who harbors regret over her role in Kazan's curse. On their journey, Baron and Roxy cross paths with several unique individuals who share the goal of undoing Kazan's curse. These include Capensis, a self-proclaimed \"Gunner of Love\" with mysterious origins; Ryunmei, a freakishly strong fist-fighter; and Ixia, a troublesome young mage whose chaotic magic often causes more harm than good. Together, they form a ragtag group simply referred to as \"The Party.\" This motley crew traverses Arad's many threats and mysteries, from underground fight clubs to axe-wielding demons. Though finding a cure for Baron's arm remains the central mission, the members of The Party band together through camaraderie and a collective desire to lift Kazan's curse from the land. By supporting each other, they just may survive the demonic dangers and Ixia's magical mishaps long enough to achieve their goal.",
