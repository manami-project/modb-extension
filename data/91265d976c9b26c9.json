    "text": "Harlock, the legendary space pirate, returns to the cosmos alongside young Tadashi Daiba after a five-year hiatus, following an archaeological mishap that unleashes Noo, a malevolent alien force, into the universe. As Noo schemes to annihilate all life, the Earth government falls under the control of the invading Illumidas, leaving Harlock and his crew as the last line of defense against both threats.\n\nWhen Tadashi's father, Professor Daiba, is killed by the mysterious Nu, the young man's life intertwines with Harlock's, as they embark on a perilous journey aboard the starship Arcadia. With the crew reunited, they sail the stars to confront Noo and the Illumidas, seeking vengeance and striving to save the galaxy from the brink of destruction.\n\nAs Tadashi transforms from a rebellious punk to a determined warrior, he finds his purpose aboard the Arcadia, fighting alongside Harlock and the crew in a desperate attempt to reclaim Earth and restore peace to the universe.",
