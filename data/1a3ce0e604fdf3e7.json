    "text": "Piloted by five elite young soldiers, five formidable mobile suits known as Gundams descend from the space colonies to Earth in the year After Colony 195. As the United Earth Sphere Alliance and its covert organization OZ maintain a ruthless grip on both Earth and the colonies, these virtually indestructible Gundams mark the colonies' last hope for freedom. One of the pilots, assuming the identity of the assassinated colony leader Heero Yuy, crosses paths with Relena Peacecraft, the daughter of a peace-seeking politician. As the Gundams embark on their mission of vengeance, the lives of Heero and Relena become intertwined, forever altering the course of destiny for Earth and the colonies.",
