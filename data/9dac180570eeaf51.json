  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Temple Saienji's exorcist nuns are on a mission with an unexpected twist in the anime Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! Under the pretense of starring in a film, the group of young nuns aims to expel a spirit that has been haunting the movie studio. However, before they can do so, they must wait for the spirit to appear. To pass the time, the nuns take turns interviewing each other during filming breaks, sharing personal experiences and insights about their relationships with one another. But will they be able to accomplish their task amidst these revealing conversations?\n\nIn a behind-the-scenes special, the main characters of Amaenaide yo!! Katsu!! open up about their past experiences with the show and their working relationships with their fellow cast members. This unique perspective offers viewers a chance to get to know the characters on a deeper level.\n\nJoining the original six girls is Kazuki Kazusano, who teams up with Ikkō. With Kazuki's arrival, Ikkō finds himself in increasingly awkward situations with these priestesses-in-training, adding a new layer of comedic tension to the story.",
