  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earth's waning faith in dreams and magic has cast a dark shadow over the enchanting realm of the Kingdom of Magic, where Mint, a benevolent and compassionate 12-year-old princess, resides. In this whimsical world, witches soar on brooms and vacuum cleaners, and the emotional state of humanity is mirrored in a vibrant rainbow garden of flowers.\n\nAs Mint's 12th birthday approaches, her father, the King, bestows upon her a crucial mission: to venture into the world of mortals and restore their hopes and dreams. The once-colorful rainbow garden now stands desolate, its flowers uniformly blue, reflecting the sadness that has gripped humanity. To prove herself a worthy successor to the throne and save her realm from decay, Mint embarks on her journey.\n\nWith the support of her magical Aunt Herb, who runs a charming gift shop on Earth called the \"Happiness Shop,\" Mint must distribute seeds of happiness among the people. Alongside her newfound human friends Nut and Plum, and her loyal winged companion Waffle, Mint strives to help others rediscover their dreams through enchanted items from her shop.\n\nAs Mint attends a regular school and adapts to life on Earth, she must find the strength within herself to reignite the hopes and dreams of humanity, and in doing so, safeguard her own magical world.",
