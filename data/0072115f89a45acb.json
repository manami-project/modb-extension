    "text": "Two years into her peaceful life in Sakurashin, Rin Azuma, a Jiang-Shi yokai and employee at a local ramen shop, finds her tranquility disrupted by the sudden arrival of her former friend, Zakuro Kurumaki. Zakuro's mission is to capture Rin and persuade her to join forces with the yokai hunters to wreak havoc on the city, a plan orchestrated by the series' main antagonist, Enjin Hiizumi. As the threat looms, Akina Hiizumi and the rest of the Hiizumi Life Counseling Office spring into action to safeguard Rin, neutralize the yokai controlling Zakuro, and shield the city they call home. This Original Video Animation (OVA) is based on the captivating 'Sea of Stars' (Hoshi no Umi) arc from the manga, covering chapters 26 to 34 (volumes 5 to 7).",
