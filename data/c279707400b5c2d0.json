    "text": "In a parallel world called Beyondard, humans and Net Navis coexist alongside two warring cyber beasts, Gregar and Falzar. Their loyal followers, the Zoanoroids, battle on their behalf. A child-like Net Navi named Trill has mysteriously crossed over from this primitive land and appeared in modern-day Japan. He holds the key to ending Gregar and Falzar's ages-old conflict. When young Net Savior Netto Hikari and his Net Navi Rockman discover the displaced Trill, they vow to shield him from the pursuing Zoanoroids. Despite facing this new enemy, the duo remains determined to guard their new friend while unraveling his true nature and connection to the dueling titanic beasts. To protect Trill, they may even have to traverse to the savage world of Beyondard itself.",
