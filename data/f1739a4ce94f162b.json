  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earth, hundreds of years after the 20th century, lies in ruins, ravaged by nuclear and biological warfare, leading to the sixth mass extinction event, \"The Big Six.\" The once thriving ecosystems have collapsed, leaving most of the planet contaminated and the majority of flora and fauna extinct. In response, humanity constructed cities in the sky, rescuing endangered species and fostering their evolution through artificial genetic crossbreeding. Over time, these animals developed language, bipedality, and established a prosperous civilization, disregarding the devastated world below.\n\nOne day, a mysterious seed drifts into one of these sky cities, capturing the curiosity of three young inhabitants: Kui, Hiruma, and Root. Unable to quell their fascination, they embark on a daring adventure to explore the desolate world below, unaware that their journey will be a one-way trip.\n\nAs Hilma, Kui, and Root traverse the unknown terrain, they encounter new plants and animals, forging friendships along the way. When a cherished caterpillar companion is snatched by a formidable bird, the trio bravely rises to the challenge, vowing to rescue their friend and uncover the seed's origin.",
