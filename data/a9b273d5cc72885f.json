    "text": "Kagamihara Nadeshiko, a high school girl who recently moved from Shizuoka to Yamanashi, embarks on a solo cycling journey to catch a glimpse of the iconic Mount Fuji, as seen on the 1000 yen bill. Despite her determination, the worsening weather forces her to turn back before reaching her destination. Disheartened and lost, she faints midway. Upon waking up, Nadeshiko finds herself in an unfamiliar place under the night sky, unsure of how to return home.\n\nFortunately, she stumbles upon Rin Shima, a fellow high school student who enjoys solo camping trips near the base of Mount Fuji. Rin's peaceful camping experience takes an unexpected turn as she welcomes the lost Nadeshiko into her campsite. The two strangers find solace in each other's company, warming themselves by the campfire while sharing a simple meal of cup ramen.\n\nAs their chance encounter unfolds, Rin and Nadeshiko discover their shared love for the great outdoors and the picturesque views of Mount Fuji. This serendipitous meeting marks the beginning of a heartwarming friendship and the promise of many more camping adventures together.",
