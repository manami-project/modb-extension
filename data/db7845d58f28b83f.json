    "text": "Things take a drastic turn for high school student Tohru Honda when a family tragedy leaves her without a home, forcing her to live in a tent. Little does she know, her makeshift shelter is situated on the private property of the enigmatic Sohma family. Upon discovering her living situation, the Sohmas invite Tohru to stay with them, where she uncovers their astonishing secret: members of the family transform into the animals of the Chinese Zodiac when embraced by someone of the opposite sex. As Tohru navigates her new life with the Sohmas, she finds herself entangled in a world of romance, laughter, and ancient curses. Based on the manga series serialized from 1998 to 2006, this anime follows Tohru's journey as she learns the true meaning of family and love while living with the zodiac-bound Sohmas.",
