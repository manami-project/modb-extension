    "text": "Flying through the universe, the power of hard rock music is the galaxy's last hope against an evil alien invasion. Back on Earth, Oji Tanaka, once known as Gabriel, the legendary lead guitarist of the heavy metal band Black Heaven, now finds himself trapped in a mundane life as a salaryman in Tokyo. With a nagging wife, a young son, and a monotonous job, the only solace he finds is in the memories of his youthful days of passion and excitement. But when a mysterious and beautiful woman named Layla asks him to pick up his Gibson Flying V once more, Oji is thrust into an intergalactic war where his music holds the power to save the universe. Will Oji choose to reignite the magic of his past and become the hero the galaxy needs, or will he continue to live a life of mediocrity, bound by the responsibilities of his family and society? The fate of the universe rests on the power of his guitar.",
