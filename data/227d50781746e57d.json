    "text": "Arima Teppei's life is turned upside down when he loses his parents in a tragic car accident. He is taken in by his wealthy and powerful grandfather, Isshin Arima, who reveals that Teppei is now the heir to the Arima business empire. Isshin demands that Teppei succeed him as head of the Arima Group corporation. To prepare for his new role, Teppei enrolls in Shuuhou Academy, an elite high school for the children of the rich and influential. Here he rubs shoulders with other young aristocrats, including his aloof and sharp-tongued fianc√©e Sylvia van Hossen, who he is arranged to marry. On his first day at Shuuhou, Teppei is shocked to encounter Princess Charlotte, a girl he recently rescued from thugs. Still struggling to adjust to his new celebrity status, lavish lifestyle and array of servants, Teppei faces further trials navigating the cutthroat social politics of his new privileged peers. Yet with his kind heart and noble spirit, Teppei strives to stay true to himself while preparing to take over his grandfather's far-reaching business empire.",
