  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2022, the world is plunged into darkness when an EMP blast causes a catastrophic global blackout. Chaos and destruction ensue, with implications spanning the entire planet. Visionary director Shinichiro Watanabe, known for anime classics 'Cowboy Bebop' and 'Samurai Champloo', helms this new animated short film that serves as a prequel to the highly anticipated feature 'Blade Runner 2049'. Titled 'Blade Runner: Black Out 2022', this thrilling prologue aims to bridge the gap between the original sci-fi masterpiece and its forthcoming sequel while offering fans a tantalizing taste of things to come in the Blade Runner universe. As society crumbles from the devastating effects of the blackout, the stage is set for the neo-noir future depicted in 'Blade Runner 2049'. With Watanabe's signature style, 'Black Out 2022' promises to be a stylish, suspenseful, and thought-provoking anime experience.",
