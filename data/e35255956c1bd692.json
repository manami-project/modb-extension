  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This music video directed by Yoshihito Katou features the song \"Koe Dake ga\" performed by the band Hatena. It serves as a continuation of the storyline from Hatena's previous \"Yume ja Nai\" music video. The \"Koe Dake ga\" song was also utilized as the ending theme song in the anime series Dr. Stone: Stone Wars. Given the multiple connections to Dr. Stone outlined across the provided synopses, viewers familiar with that anime may recognize callbacks and find additional meaning in the visuals and narrative of this music video. With directing by Katou and music by Hatena, this video promises to deliver an engaging audiovisual experience for fans of the artists or the Dr. Stone series. The overarching storyline, established in the previous video and continued here, further provides an intriguing hook for potential viewers.",
