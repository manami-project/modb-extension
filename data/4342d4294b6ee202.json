    "text": "After the death of the ruler of Felicidad, a despotic overlord named Glaza seizes power and imposes an oppressive regime over the inhabitants of the world. The story follows a group of \"Farmagia\" friends, led by Ten, who have the ability to train and control monsters. As Farmagia, the group explores treacherous lands in the Underworld, battling and collecting resources. They take these resources back to their monster farm, where they nurture and grow an army of monsters. Through upgrading their Farmagia skills and developing new monster traits, they aim to build up their strength to battle Glaza and the oppressive Oraci√≥n Seis generals, taking back control and restoring peace. This anime project is based on a game of the same name and promises exciting monster battles and adventures in a rich fantasy world plunged into political turmoil.",
