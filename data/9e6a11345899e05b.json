    "text": "Minna no Uta, a program on NHK, showcases the heartwarming music video for Tomo: Tabidachi no Toki, a melodious creation by Yuzu. This song serves as a beacon of inspiration and encouragement for middle school students who face the daunting task of stepping into their future, leaving behind their cherished elementary school memories, friends, and ideals. The song's emotional depth and resonance earned it a special place as the assignment song for the junior high school club at the 80th NHK National Music Contest.",
