  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Atsuko Kagami, affectionately known as Akko-chan, is a lively elementary school student with a peculiar fondness for mirrors. Living with her mother while her father captains a luxury cruise ship, Akko-chan's world turns upside down when her cherished mirror, a gift from her parents, shatters into pieces. Unable to discard the broken fragments, she buries it in her backyard, a testament to her respect for the mirror.\n\nOne fateful night, the spirit of the mirror (or the Queen of the Mirror Kingdom, depending on the version) appears before Akko-chan, touched by her reverence. In gratitude, the spirit bestows upon her a magical mirror and a mystical incantation, empowering Akko-chan with the ability to transform into anything she desires.\n\nWith her newfound powers, Akko-chan takes on the challenges and concerns of her town, growing and learning with each transformation. However, she must uphold a solemn vow to the spirit: never to reveal her secret powers or display them openly. Will Akko-chan be able to keep her promise while continuing to help those around her? Only time will tell.",
