His life takes a thrilling turn when he crosses paths with Rane, an ethereal fairy hailing from another realm, in search of the elusive Four Hearts treasure. Gou's relentless pursuit of the mythical Salamander Treasure becomes a whirlwind of chaos and excitement, much to the dismay of his childhood friend, Mari, who finds herself entangled in the adventure when she befriends Leen, another fairy with a hidden agenda.\n\nGou's treasure hunting escapades unintentionally interfere with a clandestine project spearheaded by Mari's father, leading to a series of unexpected revelations.
