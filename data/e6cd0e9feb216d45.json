    "text": "Hiro, Kouji, Kazuki, Shin Ichijou, and seven other aspiring students enroll in the prestigious Edel Rose training school, all sharing a common dream: to become the next Prism Stars and perform in future Prism Shows. However, their journey is fraught with challenges as the malevolent Jin Norizuki from the rival school Schwarz Rose threatens the very existence of Edel Rose. In a desperate attempt to save their school, the popular unit Over The Rainbow goes on an indefinite hiatus, leading its members down separate paths.\n\nKouji embarks on a mission to Hollywood to produce film music and pay off a massive debt, while Kazuki sets out on a journey of self-discovery to reconnect with his street-style roots. Meanwhile, Hiro undergoes rigorous special training to hone his skills as a Prism Star. As each member faces their own trials and tribulations in different locations, they are forced to confront their identities as Prism Stars.\n\nWith the Prism King Cup, an event held once every four years, on the horizon, the stakes are higher than ever. As Schwarz Rose looms in the background, the question remains: who will emerge victorious and claim the title of Prism King, the one who can make girls' hearts flutter the most?",
