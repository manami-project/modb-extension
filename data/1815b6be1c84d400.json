    "text": "Modern civilization crumbles when a mysterious light petrifies humanity, leaving behind a world of stone statues. After thousands of years, brilliant scientist Senku awakens to find himself in a petrified world, determined to restore humanity and its achievements. However, Tsukasa, a formidable adversary, opposes Senku's vision, believing only the strongest should be revived. As spring arrives, Senku and his Ishigami Village allies prepare to confront the Tsukasa Empire, armed with their latest invention - a reinvented cell phone. With the ambition to recruit Tsukasa's followers and expand the Kingdom of Science, Senku engages in a race against time, as both sides strive to gather support and resources. As the Stone Wars ignite, Senku must rely on his intellect, science, and the strength of his friendships to achieve his goal of reviving humanity and defeating the Tsukasa Empire. The battle for the future of humanity has begun, and only one vision can prevail.",
