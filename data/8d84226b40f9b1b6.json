    "text": "He is the lone human in a city of ruins, a place far removed from the living, and his name is Will. Raised by an unlikely trio of undead guardians—Blood, the valiant skeleton; Mary, the elegant mummy; and Gus, the cantankerous ghost—Will is taught the ways of combat, magic, and faith. Above all, he learns the true essence of love from his undead caretakers. As he matures and begins to question his own identity and the enigmatic world around him, Will is set on a journey to unravel the secrets of this desolate land and the undead who inhabit it. Along the way, he will discover the virtues and vices of divine powers, and ultimately strive to fulfill his destiny as a Paladin, bound by an unbreakable oath.",
