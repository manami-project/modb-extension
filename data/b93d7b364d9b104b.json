  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sasuke is an ordinary college student who has a passion for studying the Sengoku period of Japanese history. However, his life takes an extraordinary turn when he accidentally travels back in time to the actual Sengoku era. Sasuke quickly realizes that this version of history is completely different from what he learned in textbooks - the legendary warlords like Oda Nobunaga and Toyotomi Hideyoshi that he meets face-to-face are transformed into handsome young men! Initially mistaken for a spy, Sasuke earns Nobunaga's trust and becomes his vassal. Thrilled to interact with these iconic historical figures, he introduces modern concepts like tennis and chain letters to the warlords' amusement. Through this thrilling adventure back in time, Sasuke finds camaraderie and a sense of belonging in the Sengoku world that captivates him in ways his modern college life never could. With drama and comedy intertwined, Sasuke's journey makes for an exciting twist on the Sengoku period.",
