    "text": "Unexpected alliances and bitter rivalries unfold in the year 2045 aboard the Aries space station, a hub for both civilians and students of the Central Military Academy. When the station comes under attack by the ruthless terrorist group, Hallarax, a group of third-year students, including Aizawa Ryouta, his love interest Nagase Sayaka, his unacknowledged rival Nitta Kazuhiko, and his older brother, the proclaimed genius Aizawa Shuuhei, must band together to protect the station and the Earth below. As they fight for survival, a mysterious third enemy emerges, forcing the group to confront treachery and greed. With no hope of rescue, they must rely on their training and each other to uncover the truth and find a way back home. In the heat of battle, the masks people wear are torn down, revealing their true nature and the unexpected bonds of camaraderie that form in the face of adversity.",
