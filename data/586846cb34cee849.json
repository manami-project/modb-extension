  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yoshino's promise to Masamune sets the stage for the next phase of his plan: to make Aki fall in love with him in the romantic city of Paris and then reject her just as she did years ago. But their class trip to France takes an unexpected turn when they encounter Muriel, a French otaku with a passion for manga. Muriel enlists Masamune as a model for her manga, and Aki is dragged along for the ride. But the task is not as simple as it seems, as Muriel's ideas about romantic comedy are far from conventional. To make matters worse, the sinister Kanetsugu is lurking in the shadows, posing as Aki's childhood friend in an attempt to swindle her. With the mafia on their tail and a fake date to navigate, Masamune's plan for revenge is proving to be more complicated than he ever imagined. Will he be able to carry out his plan, or will the twists and turns of their Parisian adventure change everything?",
