    "text": "They'll sing, they'll dance, they'll legislate! Welcome to a parallel universe where idols are not just entertainers, but also political leaders. In a Japan grappling with income disparity, environmental pollution, childcare issues, and rampant corruption, idols from seven distinct political parties have stepped into the political arena to rejuvenate the nation. Representing parties such as the Heroine Party, Sunlight Party, Starlight Party, Bishoujo Party, Wakaba Party, Subculture New Party, and SOS Party, these idol Diet members are tasked with reviving the smiles of the Japanese people and restoring the nation's lustre.\n\nAfter more than two decades of prosperity under the leadership of the idol-turned-politician Mikazuki Kagura, Japan's idol government faces an unexpected challenge. With Kagura's sudden retirement, the 47 idol Diet members must now compete to fill her shoes and become the next Prime Minister. Can they continue to harmonize their political and entertainment duties while vying for the highest office in the land? Tune in to find out!",
