    "text": "After their defeat against Suzuridani Academy, Tomoka and her teammates on the Keishin Academy elementary school girls' basketball team were more determined than ever to improve their skills. Under the guidance of their coach, Subaru Hasegawa, the girls doubled down on practice time, pushing themselves out of their comfort zones. Just when the team was gaining confidence, new fifth grade players emerged as formidable opponents. Towering over Tomoka and her friends in height, these skilled adversaries posed a considerable challenge. To overcome the odds, Tomoka and her teammates must band together, supporting each other on and off the court.
