  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the bustling life of Yohko Yamamoto, the thrill of the arcade and the cosmos collide! A natural athlete and social butterfly, Yohko finds herself just as skilled at piloting spaceships as she is at gaming. After an unexpected accident aboard the starship TA-29 leaves her with amnesia, Yohko is transported back to the seemingly ordinary world of high school in 1999. But as fragments of her past begin to resurface, she discovers that her life is anything but typical.\n\nWith one foot in the year 2000 and the other in 3000, Yohko and her friends embark on thrilling adventures through time, navigating the perils of space and the bonds of friendship. As humanity wages a starship war between the Terra and Ness factions, Yohko's exceptional piloting skills and unwavering spirit make her an invaluable asset to the TERRA team.\n\nReunited with the TA-29 and her crew, Yohko's memories come flooding back, and she embraces her true identity as the Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko. With her newfound friends by her side, she faces the challenges of interstellar warfare and the uncanny resemblance it bears to an arcade game, igniting her passion for adventure and her determination to win.",
