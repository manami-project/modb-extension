    "text": "How would you feel if the world suddenly stopped acknowledging your existence? This is the peculiar reality faced by Mai Sakurajima, a once-famous child actress and current high school senior, who finds herself invisible to everyone around her. Well, almost everyone. Enter Sakuta Azusagawa, a perceptive second-year student who not only sees Mai but encounters her in an unusual bunny girl outfit at the local library. As Sakuta navigates the enigma surrounding Mai's invisibility, he delves deeper into the mysterious phenomenon known as 'Puberty Syndrome.' This supernatural affliction, thought to be a mere internet rumor, appears to be affecting several adolescent girls in Sakuta's school. As he unravels the secrets of this elusive condition, Sakuta forms an unlikely bond with Mai and other girls affected by Puberty Syndrome, embarking on a journey of self-discovery and empathy in a picturesque coastal town.",
