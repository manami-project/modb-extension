  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hige-san, a working adult, awakens to find his consciousness transferred into the body of a baby at his own office desk. Confused, he looks up to see his colleague Wakabayashi enter, inexplicably dressed in a school uniform. Trapped in this bizarre predicament, Hige struggles to make sense of the situation. His adult mind remains, yet his physical form and instincts are those of an infant. When Wakabayashi picks him up, his infantile impulses take over against his will. It appears Hige has woken up in an alternate reality where both he and Wakabayashi are transformed in unexpected ways. With no explanation offered, the viewer is left to unravel the mystery of how and why this has occurred. Full of hilarious antics and absurdity, this unaired bonus episode promises to deliver more of the offbeat office comedy that fans have come to love. Will Hige find a way back to normal? Or will he have to somehow adapt to this topsy-turvy new world?",
