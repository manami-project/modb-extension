    "text": "Seigaku's elite tennis team, representing Japan, embarks on a thrilling journey to England to compete in a prestigious junior tournament at Wimbledon. However, their trip takes an unexpected turn when they, along with their fierce rivals from Hyoutei Academy, Shitenhouji Middle School, and Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School, are ambushed by a notorious group of street tennis players known as Clack. Recognizable by their distinctive silver rings, Clack's members have been ostracized from official tournaments due to their aggressive playstyles and unsportsmanlike conduct.\n\nAs the injured players recuperate in the hospital, the middle school students gather to strategize against Clack, only to be interrupted by the enigmatic Ling Xiu. Xiu, a former Clack member, warns the students about the futility of challenging Clack's ruthless tennis style. Undeterred, Seigaku's prodigy, Ryouma Echizen, teams up with Xiu to confront Clack's leader, Keith, with the intention of single-handedly putting an end to their reign of terror. As Ryouma uncovers Xiu's hidden motive, he becomes even more resolute in his quest to defeat Keith and save him from self-destruction. This 10th-anniversary movie of the Prince of Tennis anime promises a thrilling and emotional rollercoaster ride for fans of the series.",
