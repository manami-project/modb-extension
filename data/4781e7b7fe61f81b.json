  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kamille Bidan, a young rebel with a deep-seated hatred for the ruthless military organization known as the Titans, joins forces with the Anti-Earth Union Group (AEUG) in the fight for the sovereignty of the colonies. Set in Universal Century 0087, seven years after the end of the One Year War, the Earth Federation's elite special operation unit, the Titans, has been formed to hunt down remnants of the Zeon Empire. However, their actions soon escalate, leading to the formation of the AEUG to stop them. Kamille, armed with a stolen \"Gundam Mk-II\" of the latest production, sets out on a mission to attack the Titans' Earth headquarters at Jaburo. This digitally remastered film, part of Gundam's 25th Anniversary celebration, brings a fresh perspective to the Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam series with new footage added to the original content. Will Kamille and the AEUG succeed, or are they walking into a trap set by the Titans?",
