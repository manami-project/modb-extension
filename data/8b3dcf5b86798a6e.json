  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aida Nonoka, a talented young judo practitioner, finds herself at a crossroads when she is saved from a drunken assailant by a mysterious judoist bearing a distinct scar on his back. Inspired by her savior, Nonoka transfers to a new high school, vowing to become as skilled as the stranger who rescued her and hoping to one day recognize him by his unique scar. As she navigates her new environment, she encounters two older boys who could potentially be the person she owes her life to and, perhaps, her heart.\n\nAdding to the complexity of her life, Nonoka's childhood friend, Ichijou Hajime, returns from abroad with the intention of fulfilling a promise made to her late father: to marry Nonoka. As Hajime pressures her to honor this commitment, Nonoka finds herself torn between her feelings for two classmates - a charismatic pianist and a fellow judo student - and the obligations of her past. With her judo skills and heart on the line, Nonoka must navigate the challenges of adolescence, love, and the unpredictable nature of life's promises.",
