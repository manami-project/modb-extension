    "text": "Some where between 2017 and 2031, a mysterious insectoid species known as The Blue emerged, rapidly overtaking Earth and its inhabitants. In response, humanity fled to the stars, seeking refuge in a space colony dubbed Second Earth. Yuji Kaido, a victim of an incurable disease called B-cell growth, was cryogenically frozen in hopes of a future cure. Awakening after decades in suspended animation, Yuji is greeted by a harsh reality: The Blue now reign supreme on Earth.\n\nAs Yuji navigates this nightmarish landscape, he encounters a group of soldiers led by the enigmatic Marlene. Their mission: to protect the precious few Sleepers like Yuji and ensure their safe passage to Second Earth. Joined by these warriors, Yuji fights for the survival of the human race against the seemingly insurmountable Blue threat. In this alternate retelling of the original 26-part series, Yuji and Marlene face unimaginable challenges and moral dilemmas, as they traverse the desolate ruins of Earth in search of a glimmer of hope for humanity's future.",
