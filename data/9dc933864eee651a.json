  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seven years ago, Anemone lost her father in a devastating battle in Tokyo, leaving her emotionally scarred. She finds solace in her stuffed toy Gulliver and an AI companion, but struggles with loneliness. Now a teenager, Anemone plays a pivotal role in a secret experimental unit called Acid, which aims to defeat Eureka Seven - an enemy that has already killed billions. As humanity's last hope, Anemone launches into the heart of Eureka Seven. Inside this hostile alien world, Anemone confronts difficult questions about the war, her past, and her own identity. Strange events challenge her understanding of the enemy and the mission. With the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, she faces an excruciating choice: save the world she knows or the person she loves. This new film explores the origins of the Eureka Seven phenomenon that occurred a decade prior. While revisiting the basic storyline with updated animation and voice acting, it will depict previously unseen events and relationships, culminating in an original, alternate ending.",
