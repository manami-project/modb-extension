  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Anemoneâ€™s world shattered seven years ago when her father vanished in a catastrophic battle in Tokyo, leaving her with a cherished stuffed toy and an AI companion as her only solace. Fast forward to the present, Anemone finds herself at the heart of an experimental unit, 'Acid,' with a daunting mission: to confront 'Eureka Seven,' a formidable enemy responsible for the loss of 2.6 billion lives.\n\nIn this desperate struggle for survival, humanity pins its hopes on Anemone as she plunges into the core of Eureka Seven. As she navigates this alien world, she uncovers unsettling truths about her life and the enemy she's been sent to fight. Caught in the throes of a reality-altering conflict, Anemone faces a profound dilemma: should she choose the world or the one she holds dear?\n\nMeanwhile, the narrative weaves back to the First Summer of Love, an event that unfolded a decade before the original Eureka Seven series. The films aim to shed light on 'the beginning of it all,' offering a fresh perspective on the established storyline. The journey promises a blend of reimagined scenes, newly recorded dialogues, and original content, culminating in an unexpected climax.",
