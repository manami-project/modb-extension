  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime tells the story of Jingoro Hidari, a legendary Japanese sculptor who lived during the Edo period. Though his existence is debated, sculptures credited to him can be found across Japan. As a young man, Jingoro was betrayed by his senior apprentices who caused him to lose his right arm and his foster parent. Seeking revenge, Jingoro replaces his lost limb with a mechanical prosthetic and is always accompanied by his feline sidekick \"Sleeping Cat.\" His ability to adeptly use carpentry tools with only his left hand earned him the nickname \"Hidari\" which means \"left\" in Japanese. The anime opens with a fateful dawn confrontation between a silent, ominous figure and members of a samurai clan. A battle ensues between the swordsmen and the stranger who wields tools from a large box. The man demonstrates intimate knowledge of the clan's leader, hinting at a shared history. Subsequently, Jingoro finally encounters Inumaru, one of the apprentices implicated in his foster parent's death and the loss of his arm. The stage is set for a fight to the death between the two as Jingoro seeks retribution. Originally released as a pilot to garner interest in a Kickstarter campaign for a stop-motion film, the anime features puppets carved from wood in homage to Jingoro's legendary sculpting skills.",
