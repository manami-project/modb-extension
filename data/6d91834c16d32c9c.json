As the crown becomes permanently affixed to her head, she finds herself the unwilling target of various factions vying for its possession. From bumbling foreign thieves and a gibberish-speaking little girl to a cat-obsessed cult and an infatuated assassin, Himeko must navigate this newfound world of royal intrigue.
