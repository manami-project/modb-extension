    "text": "Nakahara Sunako, a reclusive high school girl with a penchant for horror movies and a disdain for beauty, finds herself in an unexpected living arrangement. After her aunt sends her to reside in a luxurious mansion with four strikingly handsome young men - Kyohei, Ranmaru, Takenaga, and Yukinojou - Sunako's quiet life takes a dramatic turn. The four men, known for their charm and popularity, are tasked with a seemingly impossible mission: transform Sunako into a refined lady. In exchange for their success, their rent will be waived, but failure will result in a tripled fee. As Sunako navigates her new life amidst these \"creatures of light,\" she struggles to maintain her dark persona while dealing with her new housemates' relentless attempts to change her. Will Sunako manage to resist their efforts, or will she discover an unexpected side of herself in the process?",
