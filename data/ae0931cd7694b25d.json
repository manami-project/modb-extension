  "synopsis": {
    "text": "He ed the ancient Chinese wisdom that forms the crux of this silent film: 'One monk will shoulder two buckets of water, two monks will share the load, but add a third and no one will want to fetch water.' The film takes us on a journey to a quaint temple perched atop a hill, where a young monk resides, diligently performing his daily chore of hauling two buckets of water up the steep incline.\n\nOne day, the tranquility of the temple is disrupted by the arrival of a skinny monk. In an attempt to share the laborious task, the young monk discovers that the carry pole is only designed to accommodate one bucket. In a bid to overcome this challenge, they decide to carry a single bucket between them. However, as they navigate the undulating terrain, the bucket proves to be an unwieldy burden.\n\nExperience the unfolding narrative through a unique lens, as the film eschews dialogue, relying instead on the power of visual storytelling to convey the trials and tribulations of the young monk and his newfound companion. Delve into the heartwarming tale that explores the intricacies of teamwork, friendship, and the delicate balance that exists within a community.",
