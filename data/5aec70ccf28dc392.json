    "text": "Re-living the past is not an option for Jinta Yadomi, a former leader of a lively childhood gang, now a recluse spending his days playing video games. But when the ghost of his beloved friend, Meiko \"Menma\" Honma, appears before him with a forgotten wish, he is forced to gather his estranged friends in order to lay Menma's spirit to rest. After a tragic accident tore them apart, each friend is now living their own life, but the guilt and pain of their past still lingers. As Jinta struggles to grant Menma's wish, old feelings and buried emotions resurface, forcing the friends to confront their strife and help not only Menma move on, but themselves as well. Can this group of friends find the strength to grant Menma's final wish and find peace with their past?",
