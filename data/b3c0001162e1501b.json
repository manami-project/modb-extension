    "text": "As high school student Shizuru and her younger sister Mizuki navigate their spiritual abilities, they learn to appreciate the delicate balance between the supernatural and the natural world. Born into a family with spiritual gifts, Shizuru can see spirits and youkai, while Mizuki is prone to being possessed by them. Unable to cope with their daughters' unique abilities, their parents entrust them to their grandparents, who live in the serene countryside.\n\nUnder their grandfather's tutelage, a powerful exorcist, the sisters learn to coexist with the ghosts and goblins that inhabit their world. As they adapt to rural life, Shizuru and Mizuki have numerous encounters that teach them to respect and treasure the beauty and marvels of life in all its forms. Through their experiences, they come to understand the importance of using their abilities wisely and living in harmony with the world around them.",
