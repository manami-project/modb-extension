    "text": "India-bound for the sacred Buddhist scriptures, Buddhist monk Genjou Sanzou and his unconventional disciple, the mischievous Monkey Deity Son Goku, embark on an adventure of a lifetime. After five centuries of confinement in a mountain following his chaos-ridden escapades in Heaven, Son Goku joins Sanzou on this divine mission, as ordained by the Emperor. Alongside their journey, they cross paths with an eclectic mix of characters, including the alcohol-loving, flirtatious Cho Hakkai and the celestial General Sagojyou. With the Dragon Crown Prince Ryuuba serving as their trusty steed, this unlikely quartet faces off against monstrous adversaries and indulges in whimsical contests, promising an exhilarating blend of action and humor.",
