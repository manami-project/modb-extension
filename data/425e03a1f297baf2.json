  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Genjou Sanzou, a Buddhist monk, is sent by the Emperor on a quest to India to retrieve the sacred Buddhist scriptures. Along the way, he encounters an eclectic group of traveling companions. First, Sanzou meets Son Goku, a mischievous Monkey Deity who was sealed away for 500 years for causing chaos in Heaven. Despite their vastly different personalities, the monk and monkey form an unlikely duo. Later on, they team up with Cho Hakkai, a charming but dangerous fighter with a penchant for alcohol, and Sha Gojyo, a general from the heavenly army. The four embark on various adventures across the land. They fight off menacing monsters, compete in handsome contests, and ultimately bond as a found family on their perilous journey to find the scriptures. Alongside them is their trusty dragon-horse companion, ready to carry them onwards through every trial and tribulation they face.",
