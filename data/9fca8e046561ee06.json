  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Young Keita Amano, an ordinary primary school student, stumbles upon an unusual capsule toy machine deep in the forest. Obeying the machine's request, he inserts money and receives a mysterious capsule. Upon opening it, he releases a ghostly creature named Whisper, who has been sealed inside for 190 years. In gratitude for his release, Whisper becomes Keita's supernatural butler and bestows him with a special watch, the Youkai Watch. This watch enables Keita to see and interact with various Youkai, supernatural creatures with unique abilities, who are typically invisible to humans.\n\nAccompanied by Whisper and a cat spirit named Jibanyan, Keita embarks on a series of extraordinary adventures. He encounters various Youkai, some causing mischief and chaos, and resolves the issues they create. By befriending these Youkai, Keita gains the ability to summon them and utilize their powers through his Youkai Watch.\n\nAs Keita navigates through his daily life, now filled with supernatural encounters, he learns valuable life lessons. The Youkai Watch not only exposes him to the unseen world of Youkai but also helps him grow and mature. This animated adaptation of Level-5's Nintendo 3DS video game promises a thrilling ride filled with excitement, friendship, and personal growth.",
