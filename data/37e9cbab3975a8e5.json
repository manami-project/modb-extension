With the dream of becoming the Shaman King, You, along with his spirit ally Amidamaru, a samurai from the past, embarks on a thrilling journey. The Shaman King is crowned once every 500 years in the Shaman Fight, a tournament where shamans from all over the world compete for the title. Winning this tournament will grant You the power to reshape the world as he desires by contacting the Great Spirit. But the road to victory is not easy, as he must face powerful adversaries, including the formidable Hao, who seeks to create a world exclusively for shamans. Along with his fianc√©e Anna Kyouyama and other friends, You must overcome obstacles and grow stronger to achieve his goal and protect humanity. Originally serialized in Shueisha's Shuukan Shounen Jump from 1998 to 2004, this action-packed series spans 32 volumes and follows You's incredible journey to become the Shaman King.",
