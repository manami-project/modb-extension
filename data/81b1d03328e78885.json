    "text": "Koichi is an ordinary high school student whose life is turned upside down when he learns he is the successor to a mysterious psychic legacy tied to an ancient tower called Babel. He discovers he has been endowed with extraordinary psychic abilities in order to defend the Earth against the forces of the evil psychic cult leader Yomi. Koichi teams up with three powerful psychic allies - the panther Rohdem, giant bird Robross, and robot Poseidon. Together, they battle Yomi's followers across the globe, from the deserts of Asia to the streets of Manhattan, finally confronting the sinister psychic mastermind in his secret base in the Swiss Alps. As Koichi struggles to control his burgeoning psychic powers, the fate of humanity rests on his shoulders. He and his guardians clash with Yomi and his renegade psychics in explosive psychic showdowns, using abilities like telekinesis, energy projection, and more. To save the planet, Koichi must embrace his role as successor to the Tower of Babel before Yomi's forces can seize control of the mythical Babel's Legacy.",
