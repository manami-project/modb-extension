  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A young monk and his elderly master are on a pilgrimage to the shrines of Kumano. Along the way, they stop at the house of a young widow who runs a lodge. That night, overcome by desire, the widow sneaks into the room of the young monk and attempts to seduce him. Wanting to escape but not wanting to hurt her feelings, the monk lies that he will return to her in three days on his way back from Kumano. When the widow realizes she has been deceived, her passion turns to rage and jealousy, transforming her into a gigantic white serpent. As she relentlessly pursues the fleeing monk, he seeks refuge under the bell at Dojoji Temple. Despite barricading themselves inside, the abbot and monks are unable to stop the serpent woman's fiery passion and insane fixation. This classic legend explores the thin line between love and madness through the supernatural tale of the serpent woman of Dojoji Temple.",
