  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The pirate crew of Monkey D. Luffy arrive on Mirror Ball Island just in time for its lively annual dance carnival, a raucous event drawing free-spirited outlaws from across the East Blue. However, their revelry is soon interrupted by a contingent of Marines searching for wanted criminals to apprehend. The Marines corner a notorious hypnotist named Jango, who narrowly escapes capture by putting the entire festival-going island into a dancing trance. Luffy and his Straw Hat pirates get inadvertently caught up in Jango’s hypnotic spell and are forced to boogie alongside the islanders through the night, unable to stop their endless dancing. With the Marines still in pursuit and the hypnotic spell showing no signs of wearing off, Luffy and his crew face the possibility of dancing until they literally drop from exhaustion. Their only hope is that the effects of Jango’s mass hypnosis will dissipate before the Marines catch up to them. Until then, there is nothing to do but keep on grooving to the chaotic beat.",
