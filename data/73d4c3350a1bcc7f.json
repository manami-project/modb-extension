  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the near future, a nuclear disaster turns Tokyo into an uninhabitable wasteland. Decades later, three teenage girls are sent into the radioactive ruins on a mission to search for survivors. Genetically engineered to resist radiation, these Coppelion girls have trained for this task their whole lives. Backed by the military, Ibara, Aoi, and Taeko comb the empty streets for signs of life. Their strangely clean clothes and lack of protective gear set them apart in the devastated cityscape. As the Coppelion use their unique abilities to help any survivors, they start to question their own engineered existences and what it means to be human. Through the eyes of the Coppelion girls, we witness the tragedy that befell Tokyo as well as the resilience of its remaining inhabitants. Their coming-of-age story plays out against a post-apocalyptic backdrop, balancing moments of desperation with hope.",
