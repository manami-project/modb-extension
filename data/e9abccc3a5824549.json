    "text": "What begins as an opulent soiree at the behest of the Queen, hosted by the young and affluent Ciel Phantomhive for London's elite, swiftly descends into a sinister affair as guests begin to fall victim to a mysterious murderer. Amidst the escalating terror, Ciel and his enigmatic butler, Sebastian, find themselves in a race against time to unravel the deadly enigma, even as suspicion falls upon Ciel himself. Collaborating with their distinguished guests, including the renowned author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, they must apprehend the killer before the grim reaper claims another victim, or before they themselves become the next target. In this thrilling OVA collection, no one, not even a debonair demon butler, is safe from the lurking menace.",
