    "text": "Shortly after their promotion to Class C, Kiyotaka Ayanokoji and his fellow students at Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School are thrust into a high-stakes, third-term special exam called the \"Mixed Training Camp.\" This unique test, held deep in the mountains, combines students from all grades and separates them by gender, forcing them to cooperate with former rivals to achieve success. With the threat of expulsion looming over those who fail to meet the benchmark, the pressure is on for Class D to prove their worth among the elite. Meanwhile, a rivalry brews between student council chairmen Miyabi Nagumo and Manabu Horikita, who engage in a competition for the highest score. As the students navigate this challenging test, they must rely on teamwork and resilience to make it through unscathed. Will Kiyotaka and his classmates rise to the occasion and secure their place in the school, or will they crumble under the weight of the competition?",
