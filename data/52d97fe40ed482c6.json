    "text": "Tsukino Entertainment Production is home to several popular idol groups who are preparing to perform at the annual Budokan Tsukino Concert. The leaders of four units - SolidS, SOARA, QUELL, and Growth - face challenges composing new songs that showcase the distinct style of their groups. Shiki Takamura of SolidS struggles with writer's block as he tries to craft an inspiring new song. Sora Oohara leads SOARA while working to move past previous mistakes. Former star Shuu Izumi pushes his new group QUELL to achieve the fame his prior group had. Kouki Etou reluctantly collaborates with rival group ZIX to prepare Growth for their debut performance. As showtime nears, the four units juggle songwriting duties, drama amongst members, and the pressures of the entertainment world. Still, they push forward driven by their passion for music. Their dedication will culminate in what is sure to be a spectacular concert featuring the unique sounds of Tsukino Productions' most popular groups.",
