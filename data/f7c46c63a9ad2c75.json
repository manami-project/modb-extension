  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a small town, a popular and seemingly perfect Saint Cecilia benevolently helps villagers solve their problems. However, after the church doors close, she reveals her true lazy nature to Pastor Lawrence, the only one who knows her secret. Though initially frustrated by Cecilia's dramatic change in behavior, the kind-hearted Pastor continues supporting her in her duties. Over time, Cecilia develops romantic feelings for Lawrence as she sees how he selflessly looks after her. Oblivious at first, tensions grow as Cecilia showers Lawrence with affection. This comedic tale follows an earnest pastor devotedly protecting a secretly imperfect saint who harbors a crush on him. Though their relationship moves at a slow pace, the saint's obvious displays of affection seem destined to capture the pastor's attention.",
