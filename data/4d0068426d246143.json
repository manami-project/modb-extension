  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There exists a world where divine entities reincarnate into human forms, and among them is Athena, the Guardian of Earth. Protecting her and the Earth are the Saints, powerful warriors capable of harnessing the energy of the Cosmos. Every 200 years, when an evil force threatens to take over, Athena reincarnates to preserve peace. Among the new generation of Saints is Seiya, who has earned the Pegasus Cloth after years of rigorous training. Alongside his fellow Saints—Shiryu, Hyoga, Shun, and Ikki—Seiya embarks on a perilous journey to protect Athena and defeat the dark forces that threaten the world. As they navigate through treacherous battles and face powerful adversaries, the Saints will discover the true extent of their cosmic powers and uncover the secrets behind their sacred armors. Join Seiya and the Saints as they forge their legends in the epic saga of Saint Seiya.",
