The machine, which responds to the patient's brainwaves, becomes an indomitable robot that seeks to fulfill its patient's every whim, leading to a chaotic day trip to the beach. Meanwhile, Haruko, Mr. Takazawa's devoted nurse, questions the ethics of the project and the hospital's tactics, finding herself in a battle against the system. As the robot gains sentience through a biochip, Haruko must navigate a tumultuous situation involving the police, a disgruntled government agency, and a group of tech-savvy senior hackers.
