  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Juntaâ€™s high school life is as ordinary as it gets, or rather, nonexistent. He's the epitome of a background character, often overlooked and unnoticed by his peers and teachers. But his mundane existence takes a drastic turn when he crosses paths with Nagisa Kubo, a captivating classmate who always seems to notice him. Kubo's playful teasing and relentless antics thrust Junta into the spotlight, pushing him out of his comfort zone and making his once-dull life vibrant and exciting. As their friendship blossoms, it's too early to label their bond as 'love.' This sweet comedy chronicles Junta's journey from being a background character to becoming visible, with Kubo by his side every step of the way. The broadcast was temporarily halted in February 2023 but is set to resume from the first episode in April 2023.",
