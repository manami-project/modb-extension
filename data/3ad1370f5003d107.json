    "text": "Marika Katou, a high school student with a knack for multitasking, finds herself in an extraordinary situation when she becomes the captain of the Bentenmaru, a space pirate ship. Despite her responsibilities as a student, a yacht club leader, and a part-time caf√© worker, she manages to navigate the galaxy with her crew, engaging in staged pirate performances for a living.\n\nHowever, Marika's routine takes an unexpected turn when she is hired to stage a raid on the luxury liner, Begin The Beguine. The mission seems simple enough, but things get complicated when they discover a passenger with a hidden agenda. The passenger, Kanata Mugen, is rumored to possess a valuable \"Galaxy-Pass,\" making him the target of various warships.\n\nSuddenly, Marika and her crew find themselves in a high-stakes race across hyperspace, with Kanata as their unwilling 'guest.' As they dodge warships and navigate subspace accidents, Marika must rely on her wits and the strength of her crew to uncover the truth behind Kanata's secret and secure the biggest prize of her pirate career.",
