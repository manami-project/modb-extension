    "text": "Okabeâ€™s life has taken a drastic turn after a failed attempt to save his dear friend Kurisu. The once eccentric and self-proclaimed mad scientist is now a mere shell of his former self, seeking solace in the mundane life of a college student. However, his past catches up with him when he encounters Maho, a colleague of Kurisu, who reveals the existence of Amadeus, an AI capable of simulating a person's memories and personality.\n\nAs Okabe grapples with his traumatic past, he is offered a chance to interact with a simulation of Kurisu, created by her former colleagues Maho and Professor Alexis Leskinen. While trying to navigate the complexities of this new technology, Okabe must confront the harsh realities of tampering with time and the potential consequences that come with it.\n\nSet in an alternate worldline, Steins;Gate 0 explores Okabe's struggle to move on from his past and the international race to build a time machine. As he delves deeper into the mysteries of Amadeus, Okabe finds himself dangerously entangled in the past, forcing him to face the disastrous consequences of disturbing the natural flow of time. Will Okabe be able to overcome his guilt and prevent new tragedies from unfolding, or will he succumb to the weight of his past? Only time will tell.",
