    "text": "Shiromitsugawa is a sleepy college town struggling to revitalize itself, even trying sponsoring a poorly-received anime to promote local folklore. But the town is shaken when sacred relics scatter mysterious artifacts that grant superpowers to various youths. Protagonist Kakeru Niimi is a responsible yet curt young man whose ordinary life unravels amidst the chaos. As supernatural murders plague Shiromitsugawa in the artifacts' wake, Kakeru and heroine Miyako Hotsu find themselves hunting the culprit. Along the way, trust and romance bloom between the two. With superpowers running amok and a killer on the loose, the fate of the town hangs on whether Kakeru and Miyako can solve the mystery in time.",
