    "text": "Zouhei's grandson, Hyouma Kunato, harbors a deep-seated resentment against tsukumogami, spirits that inhabit aged objects and possess physical forms. As a member of the Saenome clan, Hyouma is expected to peacefully send these spirits back to their realm. However, his traumatic past with a malevolent tsukumogami has left him with a violent approach towards them. To help Hyouma overcome his hatred, Zouhei sends him to live with Botan Nagatsuki, a young woman who lives harmoniously with six friendly tsukumogami as her family.\n\nAs Hyouma reluctantly adapts to his new life in Kyoto, he must learn to trust Botan and her mysterious family. Meanwhile, sinister forces threaten to disrupt the delicate balance between the human and spirit worlds. Can Hyouma set aside his anger and work with Botan to prevent impending disaster, or will his rage consume him forever?
