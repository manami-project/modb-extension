    "text": "Qi warriors of colossal stature, capable of bearing the heavens, traversed the cosmos with star-like bodies in a bygone era. Powerful clan leaders, endowed with enigmatic bloodlines, ruptured the void and birthed new realms. These ancient warriors journeyed across stellar rivers, bestowing wisdom upon countless mortals. Inexplicably, an epoch faded into silence, realms fragmented, and the ancient spirits gradually vanished.\n\nFast forward to thousands of years later, a young orphan named Nie Tian, bereft of cultivation talents and scorned by his clan, faces a life-threatening situation during a competition. At the brink of defeat, an unfamiliar force surges within him, enabling him to triumph over his adversary. However, this unexpected victory leads to his grandfather's abdication as the clan's leader. Recognizing the gravity of his actions, Nie Tian vows to focus solely on his training and avoid unnecessary confrontations.\n\nIn an unforeseen turn of events, Nie Tian discovers a hidden world within a piece of animal bone he had acquired from Zhou when he was just a year old. This revelation marks the inception of his clandestine cultivation journey, ultimately leading him back to the ancient times through the power of a single drop of blood.",
