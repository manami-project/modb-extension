  "synopsis": {
    "text": "WILLE's final stand against NERV unfolds in the fourth and final installment of the Rebuild of Evangelion, as they race against time to restore Paris from the devastation of core-ization. Misato and her crew have just 720 seconds to complete their mission, but a swarm of NERV Evas threatens to derail their efforts. Mari's upgraded Eva Unit 8 is the only thing standing between WILLE and certain doom.\n\nMeanwhile, Shinji, Asuka, and Rei (provisional name) navigate a post-Fourth Impact world, seeking solace in the few remaining pockets of humanity. Their days as Evangelion pilots are behind them, but the danger is far from over. A new impact looms on the horizon, and the Human Instrumentality Project is set in motion.\n\nAs the battle between WILLE and NERV reaches its climax, Shinji, Asuka, and Rei must decide whether to join the fight or remain in their newfound refuge. Can they save humanity from the brink of extinction, or will NERV's overwhelming technology prove too much for WILLE to handle? The fate of the world rests in their hands.",
