    "text": "Sailor Moon's fifth and final season brings back familiar faces while introducing new friends and foes. It begins by resolving past conflicts, with Queen Nehelenia returning to seek revenge, only to be defeated by the power of love and the Sailor Senshi. We then meet Three Lights, a popular idol group consisting of three boys - Seiya, Taiki, and Yaten - who transfer to Usagi and her friends' high school. However, they harbor a secret - they are actually Sailor Starlights, warriors from another solar system. The Starlights have come to Earth seeking their missing princess and the \"Light of Hope\" in order to stop the new villain, Sailor Galaxia. She is on a quest to rule the galaxy by stealing Star Seeds from humans and Sailor Warriors alike, increasing her already formidable power. Though the Starlights wish to fight Galaxia alone, Usagi and the other Sailor Senshi insist on helping their new allies, leading to their greatest battle yet. Along the way, Usagi must bid farewell to Mamoru as he studies abroad and contend with her growing feelings for Seiya. The season culminates with an epic showdown, requiring tremendous sacrifice yet proving love and hope can prevail even in the darkest hour.",
