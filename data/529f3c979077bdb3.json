    "text": "Headmaster Albus of the Royal Academy of Magic in the Kingdom of Wenias assigns Sable, a student with no recollection of his past, to a special training mission in the southern reaches of the continent. Along with his companions Roux Cristasse, the Dawn Witch, Holtz, a human girl with antlers, and Kudd, a lizard Beastfallen, Sable embarks on a journey to establish a village of witches in a region where anti-witch sentiment still lingers. As they navigate through dangerous territories, they must avoid former members of the Dia Ignis Arbiters, a notorious group of witch hunters, and confront uncomfortable truths that may reveal more about Sable's past and the world's uneasy peace after the war between the Church and witches. Will Sable and his companions succeed in their mission, or will they fall prey to the lingering embers of the age-old conflict? Join them on their journey to uncover the truth and find their place in this new era of magic.",
