  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 1532, Esteban, a 12-year old Spanish boy, embarks on a quest to the Americas seeking his identity and ancestral origins. As an infant, he was the lone survivor of a shipwreck and was rescued by navigator Mendoza. His only clue is a mysterious medallion he has worn since childhood. Esteban joins Mendoza and crew on a Spanish expedition to find the mythical Seven Cities of Gold in the New World. On their travels, they cross paths with Zia, an Incan girl, and Tao, the last descendant of an advanced ancient civilization. Zia and Tao also seek missing ancestral ties and carry medallions similar to Esteban's. Guided by the medallions, the three children venture through the Americas together with Mendoza's crew. They discover wondrous ruins and technologies of lost civilizations. Their expedition, however, is threatened by the Spanish commander Gomez and captain Gaspard who ruthlessly seek gold and conquest. As Esteban, Zia, and Tao close in on the Cities of Gold, they hope to also uncover the truth of their identities and bring light to the shadows of their pasts. Their quest is one of gold but also truth, unity across cultures, and discovering oneself.",
