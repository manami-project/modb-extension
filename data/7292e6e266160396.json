    "text": "Hino Kahoko is a second-year student at the prestigious Seiso Academy, which has separate programs for general academics and music. Students in the music program, distinguished by their white uniforms, are considered elite and usually chosen for the school's annual music competition. One morning on her way to class, Kahoko meets a fairy named Lili who gifts her a magical violin that enables anyone to play beautifully as long as they truly believe in themselves. Despite having no prior musical experience, Kahoko soon finds herself nominated to compete in the music contest against the talented music program students. As the competition progresses, Kahoko forms friendships and rivalries with her fellow competitors while also discovering a newfound passion for music. With Lili's encouragement, she pushes herself to persevere through self-doubt and outside pressures in hopes of justifying her surprising nomination. Along the way, she learns profound lessons about dedication, teamwork, competition, and finding joy in creativity. Ultimately, Kahoko must decide whether she will embrace this unexpected opportunity to unlock her inner musical potential or shy away from the spotlight thrust upon her. Her participation in the contest marks the beginning of a journey of self-discovery through music.",
