    "text": "Kurumi, the first of her kind, is a Steel Angel, a perfect blend of science and magic, created during Japan's Taisho Era. She is an artificial humanoid with extraordinary abilities, initially intended to be a weapon by the Imperial Army. However, her creator, Ayanokoji, envisions her as a leap forward for humanity.\n\nIn a twist of fate, young Nakahito Kagura, the second child of a prominent spiritual leader, stumbles upon Kurumi's inert form while daringly exploring Ayanokoji's house. An unexpected kiss amidst an Army attack sparks Kurumi to life, initiating a miracle.\n\nKurumi develops a deep affection for Nakahito, referring to him as her 'master' and obeying only his commands. Together, they embark on a comedic yet thrilling adventure across Japan, unraveling the secrets of the Steel Angels and their inexplicable existence in an era before television.\n\nTheir journey is fraught with encounters against spies, Army agents, and rogue Steel Angels, including the second Steel Angel, Saki, and the third, Karinka. Despite these challenges, the true revelations lie in the bond between a compassionate boy and the powerful android he awakened with a simple kiss.",
