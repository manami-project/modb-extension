    "text": "Haruhiko Takachiho's Dirty Pair follows the chaotic adventures of Kei and Yuri, two junior agents working for the intergalactic Worlds Works and Welfare Agency (3WA). Known as the 'Lovely Angels', these troubleshooters are infamous for their ability to create catastrophic collateral damage while solving cases, earning them the nickname 'Dirty Pair'.\n\nInitially, Kei and Yuri's personalities clash, with Kei on her fourth probation and Yuri's dating escapades well-known throughout the agency. Despite their initial reluctance to work together, the Siren crisis forces them to team up, just in time to save Yuri from the villainous Waldess.\n\nAs they continue to work together, the Dirty Pair's reputation grows, with every solved crime leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Despite their penchant for chaos, the two develop a strong partnership, though their constant bickering remains a staple of their relationship.\n\nTheir most significant adventure begins when Yuri receives a secret computer card from a dying man. With the fate of the universe hanging in the balance, the Dirty Pair must navigate an army of henchmen and a police gauntlet to unlock the card's secrets. Will they save the universe, or simply leave a trail of destruction in their wake? Only time will tell in this explosive, action-packed saga.",
