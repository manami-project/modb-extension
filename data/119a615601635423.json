  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Training to become a witch at the prestigious Luna Nova Magic Academy isn't quite what the young and spirited Akko Kagari had in mind. Despite her initial expectations of thrilling magical adventures, she finds herself stuck in tedious lectures, surrounded by strict teachers, and classmates who dismiss her idol, the world-famous witch Shiny Chariot. Akko, however, remains steadfast in her admiration for Chariot and is determined to prove her worth as a budding witch. When disaster strikes and a menacing dragon threatens the academy, Akko seizes the opportunity to demonstrate her skills and save the day. Little Witch Academia follows Akko's journey as she navigates the challenges of magic school and strives to live up to her beloved idol's legacy. This anime is a product of the 2012 Young Animator Training Project, which received funding from the Japanese government to support studios in training new animators.",
