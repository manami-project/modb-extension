    "text": "Hibari-kun’s First Love is an anime that follows the life of Sakamoto Kousaku, a high school student who, after the death of his mother, is sent to live with a family in Tokyo. To his surprise, the family is not only part of the Yakuza, but the middle sister he instantly falls for, Hibari, is actually a boy in drag! As Kousaku tries to navigate his new life with a gangster family, he must also deal with Hibari's persistent advances and come to terms with his own feelings. Will Kousaku be able to resist Hibari's charms and remain a \"normal\" boy, or will he succumb to the unconventional love story that has unfolded before him? With unexpected twists and turns, Hibari-kun’s First Love is a heartwarming and hilarious tale of love, family, and self-discovery.",
