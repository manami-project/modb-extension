  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Roughly a year after settling into Mihama Academy, Yuuji Kazami finds himself contemplating a career advancement within CIRS. As he and JB meticulously scrutinize Yuuji's past through his submitted documents, they aim to discern whether Yuuji is a suitable fit for the new role. Simultaneously, the girls of Mihama Academy stumble upon torn documents in Yuuji's room, leading them to uncover the story that has shaped—or perhaps shattered—Yuuji into the man he is today. As the girls delve deeper into the restored papers, they realize that the shadows of Yuuji's past continue to loom over his present, threatening to pull him back into darkness. This anime explores Yuuji's journey as he reflects on his past experiences, the gains and losses that have molded him, and the lingering influence of his history on his current life.",
