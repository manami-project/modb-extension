    "text": "Kumegawa Botan, Hibarigaoka Ruri, and Hanakoizumi An, three high school students with distinct misfortunes, find themselves in the unique Class 1-7 of Tennogofune Academy, a prestigious institution known for its academic and athletic achievements. Class 1-7, however, is dedicated to fostering happiness among its students, all of whom are burdened with 'negative karma' or persistent bad luck.\n\nHibarigaoka Ruri, a pragmatic student, encounters the ever-unlucky yet spirited Hanakoizumi An and the chronically ill Kumegawa Botan on her first day at school. Alongside their equally unfortunate classmates, Ekoda Ren, who struggles with romantic entanglements, and Hagyuu Hibiki, who is perpetually lost, they strive to navigate their high school years with optimism and resilience.\n\nDespite their individual challenges, these students work together to transform their school life into a blessing, turning their misfortunes into opportunities for growth and happiness in this heartwarming and comedic tale.",
