  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gojou Satoru, the most powerful sorcerer, leads a young boy named Yuji Itadori on a perilous journey to exorcise curses that plague the world. These curses, born from negative human emotions like bitterness, guilt, and shame, can only be vanquished by another curse. Itadori, a high school student with exceptional physical prowess, joins his school's occult club, which studies supernatural phenomena. One day, the club acquires a sealed cursed object that, when opened, unleashes curses upon the school.\n\nTo save his friends from the curses, Itadori consumes a cursed finger belonging to Ryomen Sukuna, the King of Curses. This act binds Itadori and Sukuna together, forcing them to share one body. Under Gojou's guidance, Itadori enrolls in Tokyo Jujutsu High School, an institution dedicated to combating curses. Thus begins Itadori's heroic tale as a curse exorcist, a path from which he can never turn back. As he navigates this dangerous new world, Itadori strives to find the right death, a death that will free him and those around him from the grip of curses.",
