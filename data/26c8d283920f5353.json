  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shortly before the New Year, in the heart of the Chaldea Institute, a forgotten storage room known as \"Moonlight\" or the \"Lost Room\" holds a special power. This room, produced by the Chaldea Summoning System, serves as the boundary between dreams and reality, illuminated by the soft glow of the moon. It is a place where one can encounter lost objects or individuals who have experienced loss.\n\nAs the staff of the institute prepares for a change, Mash sets out to find her colleague, Ritsuka, who was last seen near this mysterious room. Olga Marie Animusphere, the head of the institute, pays a visit to the Lost Room, contemplating her father's legacy and her own leadership capabilities. Later, Ritsuka finds himself drawn to this secluded part of the building, reflecting on his role in the impending battle for Earth's future.\n\nThis short is a part of the Fate/Grand Order series, a popular Japanese smartphone role-playing game developed by Delight Works, based on the Fate series by Type-Moon. The Lost Room, with its unique benefits and enigmatic allure, invites viewers to explore the unseen corners of Chaldea and the hearts of its characters.",
