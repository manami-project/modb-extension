    "text": "Histoire's endless tasks and the scorching summer heat leave Neptune yearning for a break. Seizing the opportunity, she gathers her fellow goddesses Noire, Vert, and Blanc for a well-deserved vacation at the picturesque 'My Summer Vacation Mountain' in Lastation. Accompanied by their younger sisters, the group sets out for a relaxing getaway filled with laughter and camaraderie.\n\nHowever, the younger sisters' curiosity leads them astray when they stumble upon a mysterious portal hidden behind a long torii gate. Transported to an alternate dimension, Nepgear, Uni, Rom, and Ram encounter a peculiar resident who bears a striking resemblance to an older, more responsible version of Neptune.\n\nAs they navigate this strange new world, the sisters must find their way back home while learning valuable lessons from their unexpected guide. Can they return to their dimension and share their extraordinary tale with their goddess counterparts? Only time will tell if two Neps prove to be better than one.",
