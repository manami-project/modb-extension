    "text": "Shinjiro Taiga, living in the bustling New York City of the late 1920s, finds himself in an unexpected predicament after the city's recent restoration from Nobunaga's chaos. The owner of Little Lip Theater thrusts him into the limelight as the leading lady, Cleopatra, disguised as the enchanting actress Petitmint. With the Star Division members hot on his heels, a reluctant Shinjiro embarks on a wild chase across the city's five boroughs.\n\nMeanwhile, a mysterious dark-skinned youth and his servant emerge amidst the city's prosperity, harboring a silent fury aimed at none other than the Statue of Liberty. As the New York Fighting Troupe, Shinjiro and his companions must rise to the challenge of safeguarding their city of dreams from this new threat while ensuring their highly anticipated theatrical production goes on without a hitch.\n\nBlending beauty and strength, these actresses dazzle audiences on stage and protect their city in steam-powered mecha suits. With their leader Lachette Altair away on a mission, an ancient Egyptian force descends upon the city, testing the troupe's ability to balance their performance and combat responsibilities. Will Shinjiro and the girls successfully fend off mummies and magic while still finding time to rehearse for their spectacular Cleopatra show?",
