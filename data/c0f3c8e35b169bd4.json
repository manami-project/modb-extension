Meet Tanisu, the youngest child of two eccentric scientists who turned their isolated island home into a secret laboratory. In a twist of fate, Tanisu's siblings - Snow, Ashise, Aisley, and Suishi - become the subjects of their parents' bizarre experiments, transforming them into unique half-human, half-animal beings and granting them supernatural abilities. When their parents are apprehended, the welfare office relocates the siblings to a bustling island, leaving Tanisu as the sole family member untouched by the experiments.\n\nNow, Tanisu must navigate the challenges of modern society while helping his extraordinary siblings adapt to their new environment. As the only sibling with a grasp on the norms of the outside world, he takes on the responsibility of concealing their peculiar traits and guiding them through the complexities of everyday life. Can Tanisu and his siblings find a way to live as a normal family, or will their unusual abilities and origins forever set them apart? Join them on their heartwarming and chaotic journey to discover what it truly means to be a family.",
