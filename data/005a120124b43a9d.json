    "text": "Anjaâ€™s life is far from easy, living in a humble forest hut with her cruel stepmother and stepsister. Despite her hardships, she remains kind-hearted, often performing selfless acts like feeding animals during winter, only to be met with additional chores. Meanwhile, a capricious queen expresses her desire for a bouquet of snowdrops for New Year's Day, offering a generous reward. Seizing the opportunity, Anja's greedy stepmother sends her into the snowy forest to find the flowers.\n\nIn the heart of the forest, Anja stumbles upon twelve enigmatic figures gathered around a fire, who reveal themselves to be the spirits of the Twelve Months. Moved by her plight, April allows her to pick the coveted snowdrops. As a token of gratitude, Anja receives a magical ring that can summon the Twelve Months, with the condition of keeping their secret. As her stepmother's suspicions grow, Anja's loyalty is pushed to its limits.\n\nFeaturing music from the Leningrad Symphony Orchestra, this heartwarming tale showcases the power of kindness and the magic of the Twelve Months as they help a young girl navigate the challenges of her life.",
