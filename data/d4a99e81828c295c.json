    "text": "Miyagawa siblings, Atsushi and Atsumi, are an unusual pair, each with a unique twist in their appearance that leads to a series of comedic misunderstandings and adventures. Atsushi, an elementary school student, possesses the stature and appearance of a grown man, often finding himself in awkward situations, such as being mistaken for a teacher. Meanwhile, his sister Atsumi, a high school student, is petite and frequently perceived as an elementary school child, earning her the label of a child prodigy.\n\nAs the siblings navigate through their school days, they encounter a myriad of amusing challenges and events, from Atsushi's innocent interactions with young Hina leading to his arrest to Sayo's struggle with her feelings for Atsumi's brother upon learning his true age. Despite their contrasting sizes and the ensuing confusion, the Miyagawa siblings always find a way to enjoy their daily lives. Join them on their journey as they visit hot springs resorts, participate in family relay races, and create unforgettable memories together.",
