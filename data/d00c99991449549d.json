    "text": "Daisuke Asou is a talented high school artist who is struggling with a creative block that is preventing him from painting. His childhood friend Amane, who has romantic feelings for Daisuke, encourages him to create a portrait for their classmate Yurina, who has a heart condition and is about to undergo surgery. In the process of creating Yurina's portrait, Daisuke begins to rediscover his artistic inspiration. He starts connecting with the subjects of his art on a deeper level. Daisuke also comes to realize that he reciprocates Amane's romantic love. However, reawakening his artistry brings complications too. As Daisuke regains his muse, more girls who know him become increasingly interested and involved in his life and art, creating chaos and confusion around relationships. Ultimately, reigniting his creative flame helps Daisuke find clarity - both in terms of his art and romance. The experience leads him to recognize that Amane is the one he truly loves.",
