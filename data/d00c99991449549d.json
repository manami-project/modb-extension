With a creative block stifling his artistic flow, Daisuke finds himself under mounting pressure as a prestigious art competition looms, offering a scholarship to the most gifted artist. To complicate matters, his childhood friend, Tachibana Amane, watches in distress as Daisuke struggles to rediscover his passion for painting.\n\nEnter Kimikage Yurina, a young girl with a delicate heart, and Daisuke's new neighbor, who also happens to be his first love and now his teacher. As Amane persuades Daisuke to paint a portrait of Yurina before her surgery, the stage is set for a journey of self-discovery, love, and artistic rekindling.\n\nBut the story doesn't end there.
