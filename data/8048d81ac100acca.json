    "text": "Arc End, a prestigious organization, is humanity's last defense against the monstrous Spirals, creatures spawned from isolation. Among Arc End's ranks are the elite magic users known as Periods, who dedicate their lives to defeating these beasts. Haru, a determined 14-year-old apprentice Period, finds himself in the depleted Arc End 8th Division after a mysterious theft leads to an economic collapse and the abandonment of their headquarters. Now, with only two other Periods by his side, Haru must face countless battles and conquer every mission to rebuild their division and restore hope against the Spiral threat. Meanwhile, Hal, an aspiring Period who failed the admittance test 38 times, finally joins the Arc End 8th Squad as an Assistant Period, teaming up with Gazel and Liese to embark on his own journey to protect the world from the Spirals.",
