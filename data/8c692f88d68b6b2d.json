  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Enter the world of high school student Seri Koyuki, who's striving for a typical, uneventful school life. However, fate has a different plan as he finds himself entangled with his eccentric classmate, Kabuto Hanadori. Kabuto, a self-proclaimed knight on a quest, harbors delusions of grandeur and believes that beneath his eyepatch lies his darker alter-ego, the God of Destruction, Miguel. As Kabuto's fantasies escalate, Seri becomes the unwilling straight man to his antics, attempting to maintain his sanity amidst the chaos. But with Kabuto's unpredictable chuunibyou and the addition of Utsugi Tsukimiya, a classmate with uncanny mind-reading abilities, Seri's ordinary life slips further away, leaving him no choice but to navigate the whirlwind of absurdity that envelops him.",
