    "text": "Now entering his thirties, Kiyoshi Adachi, a seemingly ordinary office worker, finds himself gifted with an extraordinary ability: the power to read minds through touch. This newfound skill, however, proves to be more of a burden than a blessing, as Adachi struggles to navigate the overwhelming thoughts of those around him. His mundane life takes an unexpected turn when he accidentally uncovers the hidden feelings of his charismatic and accomplished colleague, Yuuichi Kurosawa. Shockingly, Kurosawa harbors deep affection for Adachi, leaving him in a quandary on how to handle this revelation without revealing his secret power. As they spend more time together, Adachi's own feelings begin to evolve, forcing him to confront the complexities of his new reality.",
