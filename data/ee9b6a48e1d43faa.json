  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Anime centered on the humorous antics of the Greek gods residing on Mount Olympus, with a focus on the mischievous exploits of Pollon, the daughter of Apollo, the sun god. Eager to prove her worth and become a goddess in her own right, Pollon, along with her cherub companion Eros, frequently meddles in the affairs of gods and humans, leading to chaotic and comical consequences. Her well-intentioned but misguided attempts to assist her father in his romantic pursuits are driven by her desire for a maternal figure in her life. As she navigates through the trials and tribulations of divine life, Pollon strives to earn coins from her grandfather Zeus, hoping to expedite her journey towards goddess-hood, often finding herself at odds with various deities who disapprove of the chaos she inadvertently unleashes.",
