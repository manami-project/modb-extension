  "synopsis": {
    "text": "St. Ignacio's School for Girls is home to two rival clubs - the prestigious but nasty Debutante Club led by the wealthy and villainous Sayaka, and the far less popular Etiquette Club. When three freshmen - Shihoko, Saori, and Kanami - join the Etiquette Club, they soon discover it hides an incredible secret. The club members pilot advanced mecha suits known as Battle Skippers, becoming defenders of justice called Extars. Donning skimpy outfits, the Extars take on Sayaka and her flunky Todo as they hatch bizarre schemes of conquest and mayhem. Whether facing off against sinister corporations or stopping a plot to create a women-only utopia, the courageous Extars defend law and order with their high-tech Battle Skippers. Though outmatched in wealth and resources, the members of the Etiquette Club prove that the bonds of friendship and a commitment to doing good can overcome any obstacle. Their thrilling and often hilarious adventures in the Battle Skippers provide excitement while teaching the timeless lessons that evil must be opposed and virtue will prevail.",
