  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Because of her charm, Yoshioka Futaba was shunned by her female peers in middle school, and a misunderstanding prevented her from confessing her feelings to her crush, Tanaka-kun. As she transitions to high school, Futaba vows to shed her feminine allure and embrace a more unrefined persona to avoid the envy of her friends. Unexpectedly, she crosses paths with Tanaka-kun, who now goes by the name Mabuchi Kou. Despite their shared history, Mabuchi admits that their relationship can never be the same. Will Futaba find the courage to reignite a love that never truly began, or will the changes in both of them keep them apart forever?",
