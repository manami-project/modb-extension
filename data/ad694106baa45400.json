  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The petite and youthful appearance of 27-year-old Suzuki Mika belies her true age and profession as a teacher at Okitsu High School. Standing at just 148 cm tall, she is often mistaken for a child, making it challenging for her to earn the respect of her students. Her class is far from ordinary, comprising eccentric individuals such as a cross-dressing student, an aspiring manga artist, and a well-endowed girl with a peculiar fondness for petite women. Mika's professional journey is fraught with trials, from the sports festival to exams and the summer break, but the real test lies in managing her unconventional students. Among them is the alluring Rio Kitagawa, whose bold advances towards Mika add to her troubles, and Shizuka Nagare, the class president with an unusual motivation for her role. Despite the daily hurdles, Mika remains steadfast in her dream to become an inspiring teacher, navigating through a sea of homework and tests with her unique class.",
