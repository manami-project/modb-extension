    "text": "The new synopsis covers an anime opening theme song called \"Shukufuku\" performed by the band YOASOBI. The music video for this song was directed by Nobutaka Yoda and contains original animation linking it to the anime series Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury. \"Shukufuku\" is based on the novel \"Yurikago no Hoshi\" (Cradle Star) written by Ichirou Ookouchi, which can be read on the official website for Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury. Putting together details from the original synopses, this anime opening brings together the musical talents of YOASOBI with mecha animation from the Gundam franchise, unified by Ookouchi's original story which serves as inspiration. With music and images combined in an engaging sequence, the \"Shukufuku\" opening aims to draw viewers into the rich world of Mobile Suit Gundam: The Witch From Mercury while spotlighting YOASOBI's emotive vocals. Blending multiple creative elements, this anime opening promises to be a compelling audiovisual experience for fans.",
