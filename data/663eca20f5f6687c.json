    "text": "Tanaka, a colleague from Fumihiko's accounting department, has just been left by her boyfriend. When Fumihiko and his roommate, Aka, cross paths with her while heading out for dinner, Tanaka coerces Fumihiko into joining her for drinks, sparking Aka's envy. As the night progresses, Fumihiko finds himself taking care of an inebriated Tanaka, much to Aka's disapproval and mistrust. In this special DVD-only episode of REC, titled 'The Unforgiven', Fumihiko must navigate the aftermath of the night's events and alleviate Aka's suspicions. Will he be successful in clearing the air? This episode serves as the 7.5th of the original 9, or the 8th of 10 on the DVD.",
