While out eating together one night, they chance upon Fumihiko's colleague Tanaka, who is distraught after being dumped by her boyfriend. Seeking comfort, Tanaka presses Fumihiko to drink with her, much to Aka's dismay. As the night wears on and Tanaka grows increasingly drunk, responsible Fumihiko ends up taking her home to ensure her safety. However, this kind act plants seeds of doubt in jealous Aka's mind about what truly transpired. The next day, tensions simmer between the three as both Fumihiko and Tanaka assert nothing improper occurred. This glimpse into an untold moment in the characters' relationships highlights the complexity of human bonds. As misunderstandings and jealousy arise from even well-intentioned acts, the episode promises poignant drama that explores themes of trust and forgiveness.",
