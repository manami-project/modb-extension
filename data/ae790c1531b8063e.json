  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's a magical princess from the ethereal realm of Fenarinarsa, a land of dreams that floats in the sky above Earth. As humans lose their dreams and faith in magic, Fenarinarsa is drifting further away, and the only way to prevent its disappearance is to restore people's belief in dreams. That's where Momo comes in.\n\nSent to Earth by her parents, the King and Queen of Fenarinarsa, Momo is tasked with the mission of reviving humanity's faith in dreams. She takes up residence with her foster parents, who run a pet shop (or a hotel, in some versions), and is accompanied by her loyal animal friends - Sindbook the dog, Mocha the monkey, and Pipiru the bird.\n\nWith her magical wand, Momo can transform into an adult with expert skills in various fields, from a policewoman to a stewardess, and use her charisma to help people achieve their dreams. Each time she succeeds, a jewel appears on her royal crown, and only when all 12 jewels are collected will Fenarinarsa return to Earth's orbit.\n\nKnown as Minki Momo, this teenage princess is on a journey to restore hope, imagination, and faith in dreams to humanity, one person at a time. Will she be able to collect all 12 jewels and save Fenarinarsa? Only time will tell.",
