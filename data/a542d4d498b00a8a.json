    "text": "On the heels of a fierce battle against the formidable Link Joker that left the world in shambles, peace has finally been restored. However, Kai Toshiki finds himself in a perplexing predicament as the valiant warrior who vanquished Link Joker, Aichi Sendou, has inexplicably vanished without a trace. To make matters more baffling, all memories of Aichi have been inexplicably erased from people's minds. With only the Royal Paladin deck and the powerful Blaster Blade as his guide - symbols of their unbreakable bond - Kai embarks on a relentless quest to find his lost friend. Along the way, he encounters the enigmatic Quatre Knights, four formidable fighters who wield mysterious powers and urge Kai to abandon his search for Aichi. Armed with the newfound power of Legion, Kai must confront these powerful adversaries and uncover their true intentions, as well as their connection to Aichi. As the battle lines are drawn, Kai's unwavering determination to find Aichi sets the stage for an epic showdown that will shake the world once again.",
