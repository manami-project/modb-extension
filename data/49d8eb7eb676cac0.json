  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Paradise awaits two unlikely friends in a world where dinosaurs roam and survival is a constant challenge. A gentle Tyrannosaurus Rex, Tyrano, defies his carnivorous nature, while a tiny, flightless Pterodactyl, Punon, struggles to soar. Together, they embark on a perilous journey to find the fabled haven called Paradise, where food is abundant, and life is peaceful.\n\nAs the world around them grows colder and harsher, vegetation dwindles, and hunger grips the dinosaur community. But the bond between Tyrano and Punon only strengthens as they learn to appreciate their differences and rely on each other for support.\n\nTheir journey takes an unexpected turn when they encounter Tops, a young Triceratops who provides valuable information about their destination. But danger lurks in the form of Gorgo, a ruthless predator, and his gang, who will stop at nothing to reach Paradise first.\n\nBased on the beloved Tyrannosaurus picture book series by Tatsuya Miyanishi, this heartwarming tale of friendship and determination is a joint production between South Korea, Japan, and China. Sayonara, Tyranno is a testament to the power of love and companionship in overcoming adversity.",
