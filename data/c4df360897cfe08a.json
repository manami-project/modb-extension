    "text": "Jun-koo Oh, a 46-year-old aspiring actor, finds himself at a crossroads between his unfulfilled acting dreams and his teaching career, which supports his family. His passion for acting has been relegated to teaching drama part-time to college students, while his home life is filled with his wife's social ambitions and his son's legal troubles. As his wife pushes for a move to a more affluent neighborhood and a better education for their daughter, Jun-koo receives an enticing acting offer and the possibility of a permanent teaching position. The catch? Choosing the teaching job means abandoning acting forever. Just as Jun-koo opts for financial stability, he witnesses a potential sexual assault by Professor Cho on student Kim Ki-pum, further complicating his life. This anime, which premiered at the 2017 Annecy International Animation Film Festival, explores the challenges of balancing personal dreams and family responsibilities.",
