    "text": "Suzuki Mikura, a petite yet lethal assassin with a knack for sharp humor, leads the Danger Service Agency (DSA) alongside her two comrades. Their latest assignment: to eliminate Momokichi, the formidable owner of a professional baseball team and a notorious underworld kingpin. Momokichi's ruthless reputation precedes him, as failure on the baseball field often results in death.\n\nHowever, Momokichi's intimidating presence is rivaled by his equally menacing daughter, Momomi, a skilled killer who shares an uncanny resemblance with Mikura. Protected by an entourage of armed bodyguards, Momokichi presents a challenging target for the DSA. Yet, Mikura, who is no stranger to danger, is prepared to face the perilous task head-on.\n\nAs the DSA attempts to kidnap Momokichi, they find themselves entangled in a deadly game of cat and mouse with Momomi and her formidable squad of hitmen. With the stakes higher than ever, Mikura and her team must navigate through a whirlwind of humor, violence, and unexpected twists to complete their mission. Will Mikura finally meet her match in Momomi, or will the DSA emerge victorious?",
