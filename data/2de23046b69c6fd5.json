    "text": "Mezzoforte centers around Mikura, a spirited and dangerous assassin who is part of a trio called the Danger Service Agency (DSA). Their latest mission is to eliminate Momokichi, the wealthy yet ruthless owner of a professional baseball team, the Peach Twisters. However, Momokichi is heavily guarded, and his equally vicious daughter Momoi keeps a close watch over her father as well. Though small in stature, Mikura is bold and skilled with weaponry. Yet in Momoi she may have met her match - not only in deadliness, but in appearance too, as Momoi closely resembles Mikura. To succeed in their mission, the DSA must get past Momokichi's security detail and contend with his lethal daughter's interference. Despite the risks and challenges, Mikura remains undaunted, even thrilled by the prospect of such dangerous work. Her audacity and talent have carried her this far in her bloody profession. But in the baseball tycoon and his psychotic heir, she and her associates may have found more than they bargained for. This job will test the limits of the DSAâ€™s abilities and resolve as they pursue their perilous assassination plot.",
