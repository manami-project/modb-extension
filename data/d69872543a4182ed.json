    "text": "End of Summer is an animated coming-of-age drama that explores the complexities of relationships. The story follows Wataru, a high school student who dreams of a romantic summer with his crush, the wealthy and reserved Mai. However, Wataru must navigate a web of other young women who desire his affection, including the juvenile Miho, tomboyish athlete Misa, naive Kurumi, and caustic Satomi, a waitress at Wataru's local restaurant. When Wataru and Satomi have an intimate encounter, it sets off a chain reaction that intertwines their personal lives. Meanwhile, Mai has a self-important guardian named Kenji who looks down on Wataru's average socioeconomic status and sees himself as Mai's ideal match. As summer draws to a close, Wataru tries to break through barriers of status, personality clashes, and misunderstandings to achieve happiness with Mai. With sensual animation and complex characters, End of Summer explores the thrill and heartache of young love.",
