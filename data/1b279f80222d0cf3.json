    "text": "This vibrant anime revolves around the School Idol Club of Nijigasaki High School, a place known for its diverse curriculum and student freedom. After a successful School Idol Festival, the club is preparing for the next one, while also anticipating the arrival of two new exchange students, Lanzhu Zhong from Hong Kong and Mia Taylor from New York.\n\nLanzhu, with a keen interest in becoming an idol, is unimpressed by the club's promotional video and decides to participate in the upcoming festival solo. However, the club members, including Emma, Kasumi, Kanata, and Rina, are not ready to accept this challenge without a fight. They decide to form their own idol group to showcase their unique talents and prove to Lanzhu that there's more to their club than meets the eye.\n\nMeanwhile, second-year student Yuu Takasaki and her friend Ayumu Uehara join the club, bringing their own motivations and ideas to the table. As the club gains more popularity and attracts aspiring idols like Lanzhu, a friendly rivalry ensues. The club members work together, more united than ever, to practice for the festival and demonstrate the true essence of being a school idol.",
