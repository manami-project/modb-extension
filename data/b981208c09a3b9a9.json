    "text": "Touma Inaba travels to Tokyo to take the entrance exam for the prestigious Keio University. However, his plans are disrupted when his cousin Urara Kasuga, whom he barely remembers from childhood, shows up at his hotel room. Urara has secretly harbored romantic feelings for Touma for years. While in Tokyo, Touma also meets Mieko Yotsuba, a beautiful and sophisticated woman taking the Keio exam. Unfortunately, Touma fails the difficult exam due to falling ill with a cold Urara had unknowingly given him. Wanting to impress Mieko, Touma lies and says he passed. With no place to stay, Touma accepts Urara's invitation to live with her. But now he finds himself caught in a complicated love triangle between the seductive Urara who will stop at nothing to keep him and Mieko apart, and Mieko who attends Keio under the false assumption that Touma had also been accepted. As Touma tries to navigate this tricky situation, hilarious hijinks and passionate emotions inevitably collide.",
