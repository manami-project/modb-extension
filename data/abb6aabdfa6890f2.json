    "text": "Set in the fantasy land of Yuguto, the people believed their world was small and self-contained, not realizing it was but one part of a larger whole divided into separate domains under different rulers. Though skirmishes erupted between these areas, the kings maintained stability through roundtable diplomacy. This fragile peace was shattered by the ominous emergence of a mysterious evil group referred to as the Black Army. Led by the Lord of Black, these monsters of darkness invaded the land, conquering the capital and seizing half of the Chain Chronicle, an ancient tome said to chronicle all history. With the Volunteer Army defeated, the fate of Yuguto hangs in the balance as the Black Army tightens its grip. Yet hope remains that heroes might rise to reclaim the Chronicle and restore freedom before darkness reigns eternal.",
