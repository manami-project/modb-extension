  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime unfolds in the realm of Yuguto, a land mistakenly believed by its inhabitants to be the entire world. Unbeknownst to them, Yuguto is merely one of several regions, each governed by its own king. Despite occasional skirmishes among these territories, harmony is maintained through regular roundtable discussions among the kings. However, this delicate balance is disrupted by the sudden emergence of a sinister horde of dark monsters.\n\nThe narrative revolves around the Chain Chronicle, a sacred book that chronicles every event transpiring in the world. The story takes a dramatic turn when the malevolent Black Army invades, overwhelming the brave Volunteer Army, led by Yuri. In the ensuing chaos, the Black Army's leader seizes half of the Chain Chronicle and captures the capital, plunging the realm into darkness and despair. The fate of Yuguto now hangs in the balance, setting the stage for an epic struggle against the forces of evil.",
