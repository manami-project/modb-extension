  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ikko Satonako, a 16-year-old boy, finds himself at the Saienji Buddhist Temple under the tutelage of his stern grandmother, the temple's head priestess. Surrounded by six attractive nuns-in-training, Ikko's life seems like a dream come true for a typical teenager. However, his reality is far from it. Tasked with rigorous training and endless chores, Ikko struggles to keep up with his fellow priestesses, who seem to outshine him in every aspect of monkhood.\n\nBut Ikko harbors a secret power. When faced with situations that stir his worldly desires, he transforms into an invincible super-monk, capable of performing massive exorcisms. This unique ability, while beneficial for the temple, often lands him in hot water with the nuns, especially Chitose, who disapproves of his lustful thoughts.\n\nAs Ikko navigates through his challenging training, he must also grapple with the mysterious origin of his powers and the consequences that follow their activation. Will he be able to balance his duties as a monk-in-training with the unpredictable nature of his powers? Only time will tell in this supernatural coming-of-age tale filled with humor, action, and a dash of romance.",
