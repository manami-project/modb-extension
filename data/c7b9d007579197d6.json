  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After the conclusion of the World Duel Carnival tournament, Yuma Tsukumo continues his quest to collect the powerful Number cards, aided by his friend Astral from the Astral World. However, a new threat emerges - the Seven Barian Emperors from the Barian World. The Barians seek to gather the Number cards for themselves in order to destroy the Astral World, hoping to save their own world from destruction. Led by Girag, the Barians begin infiltrating Heartland City in human form, manipulating humans like Fender to challenge Yuma. Through these duels, the Barians aim to defeat Yuma and Astral while gathering Number cards. Despite early struggles, Yuma resolves to continue fighting alongside Astral. As the Barian plot progresses, five emperors enter the human world to accelerate their plans. Their goal remains firm - annihilate Astral and Yuma to achieve the destruction of the Astral World. However, Yuma and Astral gain new ZEXAL powers that empower them for this fight. With the fate of both worlds at stake, this new enemy will push Yuma and Astral to their limits in duels more perilous than ever before. Alongside allies like Kaito and Ryoga “Shark” Kamishiro, they stand united against the Barians.",
