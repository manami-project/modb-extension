  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With a cast of 12 unique and diverse characters, Makura no Danshi is an anime that aims to provide a comforting and healing experience to its viewers. Each episode features a different 'pillow boy' who talks to the viewer before they go to sleep, creating a 'sleeping side-by-side' experience entirely in the first-person perspective. The boys all have distinct personalities, ranging from a gentle brown-haired boy to a mature working man to a high school student who acts tough but is scared of spiders. They all live in the same town under a beautiful starry sky, and each one will star in his own weekly episode as they 'whisper' to the viewer. Whether you're feeling lonely or just need someone to talk to, Makura no Danshi promises to make you feel special and loved.",
