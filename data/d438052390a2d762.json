  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sengoku Choujuu Giga is a comedic anime that reimagines famous Japanese warlords from the Sengoku period as anthropomorphic animals. Using a traditional sumi-e art style, the show depicts these characters in both momentous historical events and mundane daily life. Popular young voice actors breathe life into the eccentric cast of characters as they jest about actual figures and events from Japanese history. Scenes range from lighthearted nonsense to surprisingly insightful commentary. However, the tone remains silly and irreverent overall. By turns amusing, ridiculous, and thought-provoking, Sengoku Choujuu Giga promises to entertain viewers while also possibly teaching them something new about the Sengoku era. Those looking for a fun take on Japanese history need look no further.",
