    "text": "Far from being the object of affection, high school student Kisaragi Amatsuyu finds himself entangled in a web of unrequited love and misplaced confessions. When two girls, the charming upperclassman Cosmos and his cheerful childhood friend Himawari, invite him out, he eagerly anticipates their confessions, only to discover that they are both enamored with his friend. As he grapples with this unexpected turn of events, a girl with glasses and braids, who seemingly revels in his misfortune, enters the scene. However, beneath her snarky remarks and sharp tongue, she turns out to be the only one who genuinely likes him. Amatsuyu must navigate this complex labyrinth of love, filled with unexpected twists and turns, in this engaging and humorous coming-of-age tale.",
