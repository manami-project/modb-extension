  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In feudal Japan, the ambitious lord Kagemitsu Daigo makes a pact with 48 demons to sacrifice his unborn son in exchange for power to rule the land. When the child is born, the demons take 48 parts of his body, leaving him for dead. The infant is rescued but grows up missing limbs and senses. As a young man, Hyakkimaru equips himself with prosthetics and weapons to hunt down the 48 demons and reclaim his stolen body parts. His quest leads him to cross paths with Dororo, a scrappy orphan thief. Though they come from different worlds, Hyakkimaru and Dororo form an unlikely friendship as they travel together. Battling human cruelties as well as demonic monsters, Hyakkimaru struggles to regain his humanity piece by piece while also discovering the true meaning of strength and virtue. With steadfast companions Dororo and their pet pup Nota, Hyakkimaru inches closer to confronting the callous father who betrayed him and achieving his long-awaited wholeness.",
