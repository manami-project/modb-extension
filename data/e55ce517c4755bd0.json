  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zafran and Revillia, two rival nations with a history of political tension, find themselves on the brink of war once more. In a desperate bid for power, both sides seek to unearth and reactivate the ancient robotic weapons known as Decimators, which have been dormant for 200 years beneath the earth and ocean. These colossal machines were responsible for nearly wiping out all life on the planet centuries ago, and their reactivation threatens to bring about another catastrophic conflict.\n\nAs the war intensifies and the leaders of both nations refuse to back down, hope for humanity's survival rests in the hands of Lean, a young cadet, and Nataruma, a woman with psychic abilities. Together, they embark on a daring mission to travel back in time and alter the events that led to the creation of the Decimators, in an effort to prevent history from repeating itself and save humanity from the brink of destruction.",
