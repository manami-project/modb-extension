    "text": "Reincarnated in a game world after a tragic accident, Keina Kagami, now known as the high elf Cayna, finds herself in the VRMMORPG Leadale, two centuries into the future. Confined to a hospital bed in her previous life, Leadale was her only escape, but now it has become her reality. Despite having lost some skills, her character possesses formidable stats, allowing her to navigate this once-familiar yet now foreign landscape. As she forges new relationships with the inhabitants of this world, she encounters unexpected connections to her past - the \"children\" characters she created herself. Join Cayna on this leisurely adventure, filled with laughter, tears, and the discovery of a new life in a world brimming with magic and mystery.",
