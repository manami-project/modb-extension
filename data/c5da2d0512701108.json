    "text": "After a tragic accident leaves her bedridden and reliant on life support, Keina Kagami finds solace in the VRMMORPG Leadale, where she plays as the high elf Cayna. When Keina's life support unexpectedly fails one day, she awakens to find herself transported into the very game world she had escaped to. Now inhabiting the body of Cayna, Keina discovers that 200 years have passed in Leadale. With no memories of the intervening time, Keina sets out to forge new connections in this familiar yet foreign land. To her surprise, some of Leadale's residents resemble characters she herself designed long ago. With her old life lost, Keina braces for the adventure and wonder ahead as she befriends Leadale's colorful inhabitants, forging smiles and tears together.",
