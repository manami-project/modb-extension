  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When the twilight descends, Takeda Keiji finds himself stood up by his beloved girlfriend and school junior, Miyashita Touka. As he resigns himself to head home, he encounters an unsettling sight: a tearful, disoriented man being approached by a caped figure bearing an uncanny resemblance to his absent girlfriend.\n\nIn the hushed corridors of Shinyo Academy, whispers of a supernatural entity known as Boogiepop circulate among the students. Believed to be a Shinigami that strikes at the pinnacle of one's beauty, Boogiepop is, in fact, a guardian who manifests as the alter ego of Touka Miyashita to combat the world's adversaries. As a series of unexplained disappearances rattle the academy, Boogiepop awakens, sensing the lurking menace within the school walls.\n\nThe children speak of an urban legendâ€”an Angel of Death named Boogiepop who can alleviate people's suffering. And indeed, Boogiepop is real. As the enigmatic figure emerges amidst the escalating mystery at Shinyo Academy, the students grapple with their perceptions of time, memories, and relationships, while confronting the sinister force lurking in their midst.",
