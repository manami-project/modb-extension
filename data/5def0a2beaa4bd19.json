    "text": "He’ll clean this city of crime, one misdemeanor at a time－as soon as the bad guys start taking him seriously. Masayoshi might start out as a nobody, but he doesn’t let that stop him. Before he knows it, his vigilante alter-ego has gained the attention of quite a number of people. Joined by good-guy cop Hidenori Goto, a J-pop star trio, an actor and martial artist master, and a motley crew of other characters, Masayoshi lives out his dream of becoming a tokusatsu superhero. But the dream is about to turn into a nightmare. Samurai Flamenco’s crime-fighting ways escalate quickly from preventing littering and petty theft to insane adventures and the fate of the world resting squarely on his costumed shoulders. What makes a true hero? Masayoshi is about to find out.\n\nIn the bustling city, a unique crime-fighter emerges, donning a handmade costume and armed with an unwavering sense of justice. By day, he's the successful model Masayoshi Hazama; by night, he transforms into the self-proclaimed hero, Samurai Flamenco. Despite lacking superpowers or high-tech gear, Masayoshi is determined to make a difference and uphold justice.\n\nHis endeavors catch the attention of police officer Hidenori Goto, who accidentally discovers Samurai Flamenco's true identity. Though initially skeptical, Goto becomes an unlikely ally, joining Masayoshi on his quest for justice. Together, they face various challenges, from minor crimes to copycat heroes flooding the city.\n\nAs the media intensifies its pursuit of Samurai Flamenco's identity, the duo must navigate through fame,",
