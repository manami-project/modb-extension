  "synopsis": {
    "text": "An introverted gamer, Takuma Sakamoto, dominates the fantasy MMORPG Cross Reverie as the Demon King Diablo. Unrivaled in power and possessing the rarest artifacts, his virtual life is his only interestâ€“until he's magically transported to a world mirroring his favorite game. In his new reality, Takuma inherits Diablo's appearance and encounters two girls, Rem Galeu and Shera L. Greenwood, who claim to have summoned him. Attempting to enslave him, the girls cast a spell that backfires due to Takuma's unique ability, Magic Reflection, turning them into his slaves instead. Socially inept and overwhelmed, Takuma adopts his in-game persona, embarking on an adventure filled with fantastical beasts and complex relationships as the formidable Demon Lord.",
