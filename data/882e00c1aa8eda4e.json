    "text": "Interspersed with a cryptic prophecy, the ordinary life of high school student Daisuke Dojima takes an extraordinary turn when he and his friends - Gai, Lu, Marimari, and Keisaku - are catapulted into a mysterious phenomenon known as 'Shibuya Drift.' The heart of Shibuya is thrust over 300 years into the future, revealing a desolate landscape of ruins and forests teeming with colossal mechanical beasts controlled by enigmatic entities called 'Revisions.'\n\nAs the monstrous machines ravage the city, a girl named Milo - bearing the same name and appearance as the one who rescued Daisuke from a kidnapping ordeal in his childhood - emerges to bestow upon them powerful weapons known as 'String Puppets.' With destiny weighing on his shoulders, Daisuke is entrusted as the sole operator of a String Puppet, tasked with safeguarding Shibuya and reclaiming the present from the clutches of a perilous future.\n\nAs the group grapples with fractured friendships and uncertain pasts, they must unite against an unknown adversary in an isolated city, fighting to restore their world and fulfill the prophecy that has dictated Daisuke's life. Amidst the chaos, the resilient bond of these five friends will be the beacon guiding them home.",
