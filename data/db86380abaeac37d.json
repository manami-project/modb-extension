    "text": "Only a second-year middle school student, Ichika Usami is a sweet-loving girl who works at her family's cafe, Kirakira Patisserie. When she learns of her mother's return from overseas, she decides to bake a cake to celebrate. However, her baking session takes an unexpected turn when a fairy named Pekorin crashes into her kitchen. With Pekorin's help, Ichika successfully bakes her cake, but their celebration is cut short by the arrival of an evil imp named Gummy. Gummy attempts to steal the cake's 'kirakiraru', a magical power that brings happiness to those who consume sweets. Determined to protect her cake and the love it represents, Ichika transforms into Cure Whip, a hero known as a Pretty Cure. Along with four other girls, she forms the Kirakira Precure a la Mode team to fight against the evil monsters known as Henteko, who are stealing kirakiraru from sweets and desserts. With her newfound powers, Ichika fights to protect the sweets of Ichigozaka and bring joy to those around her.",
