  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuta Gamon is a high school student who runs an occult blog debunking supernatural phenomena, aiming to explain them through science and logic. However, his blog brings together a motley crew of individuals with connections to the paranormal. These include his fortune teller friend Miyuu; realist Sarai whose family tragedy defies explanation; artist Ririka whose predictions manifest through her art; ghost whisperer Aria and her spectral companion; eccentric detective Shun; and journalist Touko. At first, this unlikely group seems randomly assembled. But soon, they are united by strange events shrouded in supernatural forces. As murders and other mysteries emerge, the connections binding these individuals - whether by fate, circumstance or their unique talents - grow evident. To get to the truth behind the odd occurrences in their city and lives, they must combine their diverse skills and eccentricities. Through challenging preconceptions of the paranormal, they aim to solve the puzzles while confronting truths about reality that some may prefer left undiscovered. This paranormal science story follows nine idiosyncratic characters, drawn together when unexplained phenomena and occult mysteries challenge their notions of common sense and everyday reality.",
