    "text": "NEET teenager Yuuta Gamon's life takes an unexpected turn when his occult-themed blog, 'Kiri Kiri Basara,' attracts a diverse group of individuals, each with their own unique connection to the supernatural. Among them are Miyuu Aikawa, a high school fortune teller; Sarai Hashigami, a realist grappling with a family tragedy; Ririka Nishizono, a doujin artist with a prophetic talent; Aria Kurenaino, a black magic practitioner accompanied by a ghostly companion; Shun Moritsuka, an otaku detective; and Touko Sumikaze, a reporter. As this unlikely group unites, they find themselves entangled in a series of inexplicable events that challenge the boundaries of science and the supernatural. Together, they must navigate these mysteries that intertwine their lives and threaten to upend the very fabric of their reality.",
