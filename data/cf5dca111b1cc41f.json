    "text": "Cultural funds from the Japanese government's Agency for Cultural Affairs were used to support young animators in the creation of Puka Puka Juju, one of four anime projects that received 38 million yen (about US$470,000) in 2011. The story revolves around Mika, a young girl eagerly awaiting a beach day with her father, who consistently cancels due to work obligations and his fear of the ocean. When her father is once again called into work, Mika's disappointment is quickly replaced by excitement as her inflatable dugong floatie, Juju, magically comes to life. With Juju's help, Mika embarks on an enchanting adventure to a mystical archipelago, where she finally experiences the beach fun she's been longing for. As Mika clings to her newfound friend, she realizes that her magical journey might be more thrilling than she ever imagined.",
