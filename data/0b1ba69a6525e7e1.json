  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Asakura--and his best friend, Ishida, are navigating the tumultuous waters of high school, each with their own unique ambitions. Asakura's goal is far from conventional: he dreams of becoming a high school teacher, not to shape young minds, but to be surrounded by voluptuous women. Meanwhile, Ishida harbors a desire to open a flower shop with Asakura post-graduation, and seems to have romantic feelings for his best friend, which are humorously depicted.\n\nTheir high school is populated with eccentric students and teachers, making their journey to graduation anything but ordinary. Asakura's obsession with the female form often lands him in hot water with his classmates, while Ishida remains stoic and steadfast in his pursuit of their friendship. Amidst the chaos of part-time jobs, dodging assassination attempts by robots, and dealing with their busty teacher, the duo must find a way to balance their dreams and reality. Will Asakura be able to keep his hormones in check long enough to graduate, or will Ishida's dreams of a flower shop bloom first? Only time will tell in this hilarious and bizarre coming-of-age story.",
