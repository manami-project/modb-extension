    "text": "When a colossal earthquake plunges the world into the depths of the ocean, a new profession emerges: the Salvagers, who brave the submerged ruins of cities to recover valuable artifacts. Aika Sumeragi, a skilled Salvager, and her assistant Rion Aida work for the struggling K.K. Corporation, led by Rion's father, Gozo. Their fortunes change when they embark on a mission to recover the legendary Lagu, a mysterious object coveted by the sinister Delmo Corps, led by the misanthropic Rudolf Hagen. As Aika and the Delmo Corps clash, she uncovers a hidden power within herself, transforming into a superhuman force. But Aika soon learns she's not the only one with such abilities, and the race for the Lagu intensifies. In a world where secrets and danger lurk beneath the waves, Aika must navigate treacherous waters to uncover the truth and protect humanity from those who seek its destruction.",
