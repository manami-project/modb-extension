  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime brings together the worlds of \"That Time I Got Reincarnated as a Slime\" and \"Yohane the Parhelion: Sunshine in the Mirror\" for an unlikely crossover event. One day, Rimuru Tempest and his friends from Tempest suddenly encounter Yohane and the members of her supernatural investigation team. Despite the drastic power difference between the two groups, they end up clashing in an epic battle. Who will emerge victorious from this crossover clash remains to be seen. However, fans of both series will surely be delighted by the chance to see their favorite characters interact. This collaboration also includes a series of short, lighthearted chibi episodes published on YouTube. These shorts provide some silly antics and fun interaction between the characters. Overall, this anime crossover and YouTube collaboration offers something unique for fans of isekai and supernatural series. The contrasting tones and abilities of the groups involved should make for an entertaining dynamic.",
