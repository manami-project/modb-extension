    "text": "In the year 2088, humanity faces a dire future. Scientists, driven by greed and a lust for power, have genetically engineered a new species called the \"Guilstein.\" Devoid of human souls, the Guilstein are monstrous killing machines designed to be biological weapons. Civilization as we know it has crumbled. The world is a dark, unrecognizable place filled with horror and suffering. Those responsible for creating the Guilstein have become the tyrannical leaders of this dystopian society. Yet, not all hope is lost. A group of brave rebels are fighting back, struggling to regain their humanity and overthrow their cruel masters. Outmatched and outgunned, the fate of the resistance hangs by a thread. Will they triumph and restore human dignity? Or will the Guilstein exterminate the final vestiges of the human spirit?",
