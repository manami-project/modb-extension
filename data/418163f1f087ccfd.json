    "text": "New Synopsis:\n\nIn the grim shadows of 2088, \"Guilstein\" unveils a chilling digital 3D anime film, based on Tamaki Hisao's manga, famed for his Star Wars: A New Hope adaptation in the West. The film plunges viewers into a dystopian future where humanity, as we know it, has been cruelly reshaped. The once-human beings are now 'Guilstein,' soulless creatures spawned from the twisted experiments of society's affluent leaders, hell-bent on crafting biological weapons. The world, a mere ghost of its former self, is left with little to no hope. The characters, masterfully designed by renowned creature action figure creator Yasushi Nirasawa, come to life under the watchful eye of Monkey Punch, the brilliant mind behind Lupin III, who serves as the film's script supervisor. Brace yourself for a heart-pounding blend of action and horror as you delve into the eerie world of \"Guilstein.\"",
