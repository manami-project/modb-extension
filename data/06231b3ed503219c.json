  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, hardcore otaku Bouida Haruto, a man with zero interest in real-life romance, finds himself in an extraordinary situation. He purchases a figure of his beloved anime character, Nona, from the series \"Girlsâ†’Planetary Investigation,\" despite his usual reluctance to start collecting figurines. To his astonishment, Nona springs to life, breaking the boundaries between the 2D and 3D worlds. As the two embark on a chaotic and comedic journey, an unexpected bond forms, leading to a unique, almost romantic, relationship between man and figurine. This slapstick romantic comedy invites you to witness the unpredictable daily life of Haruto and his living anime figure, Nona.",
