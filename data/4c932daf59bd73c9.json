    "text": "Heavens and Earth collide in this epic tale set in ancient China during the reign of the mighty Shang dynasty. The defiant Emperor Zi Zhou challenges the divine authority of the gods, vowing to protect his people from their tyranny. This audacious act enrages the gods, who retaliate by sending the formidable Tian Kui to quell the rebellion.\n\nZi Shou, a courageous warrior, stands up against Tian Kui, but his bravery is met with mockery from the celestial beings observing from above. In a tragic turn of events, Tian, an even greater god, strikes down Zi Shou, shattering the legendary Immortal Phoenix armor.\n\nMeanwhile, Wu Geng awakens to find himself in the body of Ah Gou, a humble existence far removed from his previous life. As he grapples with this new reality, he discovers that he now has a wife, Bai Cai, adding another layer of complexity to his already perplexing situation.\n\nAs the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, a titanic struggle unfolds between the forces of the Shang dynasty and the wrathful gods. The outcome of this celestial conflict will determine not only the destiny of the dynasty but also the future of mankind.",
