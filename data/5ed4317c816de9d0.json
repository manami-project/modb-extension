    "text": "Shiroâ€™s dream of becoming a legendary racer on the earthquake-plagued planet of Tellus is shattered when a catastrophic accident leaves him clinging to life. In a world where colossal mobile cities have become the norm and high-stakes races are the ultimate form of entertainment, Shiro's only hope lies in the hands of a mysterious woman named Tomoe. She offers him a second chance by replacing his heart with a cutting-edge engine prototype, forever linking his survival to his performance on the race track.\n\nNow, with his very existence tied to his racing abilities, Shiro finds himself demoted to a mere mechanical component in the eyes of the racing authorities. Undeterred, he sets his sights on the notorious Planet Redevelopment Race, held on a distant colonial planet. This thrilling rally attracts a diverse group of skilled pilots, all eager to prove their worth and claim the substantial cash prize.\n\nAs Shiro competes against other vetoed racers, he strives to live up to the legacy of the enigmatic Loser King, who vanished a century ago leaving behind unbeatable track records. With the stakes higher than ever, Shiro must push the limits of his newfound abilities and conquer the challenges that lie ahead in this heart-pounding race for glory and redemption.",
