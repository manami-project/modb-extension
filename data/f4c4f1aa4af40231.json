  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, a diminutive bonze named Chibisuke sets out for the city, aspiring to make a name for himself in the world. He finds himself in the service of a Cabinet minister, who is captivated by Chibisuke's charming dance performed on his palm. Chibisuke's life takes a dramatic turn when he is tasked with escorting a princess to Shimizu, and they are ambushed by a fearsome mountain devil. Despite his size, Chibisuke's courage and cunning enable him to launch a series of unexpected attacks on the devil, ultimately emerging victorious. With the devil's horn of plenty now in his possession, Chibisuke transforms into a strong and strapping young man.\n\nInspired by the Japanese legend of Issun Boushi, this comical adaptation follows the journey of a thumb-sized hero who defies all odds. In a town where people are entertained by his petite size, Issunboushi rises to the occasion when an Oni wreaks havoc on the village. With everyone else paralyzed by fear, it is up to Issunboushi to save the day and prove that heroes come in all sizes.",
