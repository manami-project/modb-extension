    "text": "Southern Cross, a military force stationed on the distant planet Glorie, stands as the last line of defense for the human colonists against the unknown perils of space. Glorie, once a desolate planet, has become a thriving colony following Earth's near-destruction in the last great world war. However, the peaceful existence of the colonists is shattered when the Zor, an advanced race of humanoids, return to reclaim their ancestral home. The Zor, who had abandoned Glorie centuries ago due to their own cataclysmic events, find their former home now inhabited by humans unwilling to relinquish their newfound sanctuary.\n\nAs the two races vie for control of the planet, a relentless war erupts, pushing both sides towards a devastating stalemate. At the heart of this conflict is Jeanne Francaix, a young and seemingly frivolous lieutenant in the Southern Cross army. With a penchant for fashion magazines, nightlife, and hot showers, Jeanne's carefree attitude initially overshadows her potential as a leader. However, her unorthodox tactics and disregard for conventional military strategies prove surprisingly effective against the technologically superior Zor.\n\nJeanne's rapid rise through the ranks places her in command of the 15th ATAC squadron, a motley crew of misfits and outcasts. As the war intensifies and humanity's resources dwindle, Jeanne must transform her ragtag unit into a formidable fighting force. Through the crucible of war, Jeanne evolves from a headstrong girl into a mature and seasoned commander, determined to protect her home and uncover the secrets of the enigmatic Zor. The fate of Glorie hangs in the balance as Jeanne and her squad face insurmountable odds in their desperate struggle",
