  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Pipo the fairy and Hippocrates the Alchemist, denizens of a magical realm, seek the aid of an unlikely hero: Akane Uesugi, a reserved sixth-grader on the cusp of adolescence. In her aunt Chi's antique shop, Akane inadvertently stumbles upon a hidden entrance to their enchanted world. Hippocrates proclaims her the prophesied \"Goddess of the Green Wind,\" destined to restore balance to their land, which is now plagued by drought and decay.\n\nWith her aunt Chi by her side, Akane embarks on a fantastical journey to save the imperiled kingdom. The water cycle has been disrupted, and the prince who should have performed a ritual to restore it has vanished. As Akane and her newfound companions search for the missing prince, they are pursued by the enigmatic Zan Gu, who is determined to thwart their efforts.\n\nBased on the 1981 children's book Chikashitsu kara no Fushigi na Tabi, this anime adaptation follows Akane as she navigates the trials and tribulations of her newfound role. With her self-confidence wavering, she must find the strength within herself to save the magical world that has captivated her heart.",
