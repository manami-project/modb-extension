  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wakaba is a lonely fifth grade girl who has the ability to see spirits and supernatural creatures that others can't. This results in her being ostracized and bullied at school, leaving her scared and isolated. One day, Wakaba encounters a cute, soft, pink monster named Poo-chan, who only says \"Pupipoo!\" Poo-chan takes a liking to Wakaba and starts protecting her from evil spirits. With Poo-chan's help, Wakaba's life begins to change. She develops an unlikely friendship with Reiko, a girl obsessed with the occult who shares Wakaba's ability to see spirits. Together, they use their supernatural powers to help others. Wakaba also meets Naoya, a boy who can see creatures like she can. With her new friends and loyal monster companion, Wakaba finds the courage to stand up to her bullies and live life with more confidence and optimism. Though still seen as creepy by some, she is no longer alone thanks to stumbling upon the mysterious Poo-chan that fateful day.",
