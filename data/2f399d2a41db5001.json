  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shouji Youko's shoujo manga, 'Seito Shokun!', serves as the inspiration for this anime, which was serialized in Kodansha's Shoujo Friend. The story revolves around Naoko, a newly appointed high school teacher, who finds herself grappling with the challenges of modern education. Amidst students who have lost faith in teachers, educators who have given up on their mission, and parents who hold schools accountable for their children's misconduct, Naoko refuses to turn a blind eye. Instead, she delves deeper into the complex issues that plague the contemporary education system.\n\nSimultaneously, we are introduced to Nakki, a vivacious girl who returns home to live with her ailing twin sister and attend a new school. Nakki's journey into adulthood is a rollercoaster ride filled with joyous and painful experiences. Along with her friends, she learns the invaluable lesson that friendship is the most precious asset one can possess. As Nakki transitions from a student to a teacher and from a girl to a woman, we are invited to witness her growth and evolution. This anime offers a poignant exploration of the trials and tribulations of both students and teachers in today's world.",
