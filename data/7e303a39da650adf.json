    "text": "Michishita is an ordinary prep school student rushing to the bathroom one day when he catches the eye of Abe, a handsome mechanic sitting on a park bench. Though initially in a hurry, Michishita pauses, intrigued by Abe's rugged good looks. Sensing the attraction, Abe invites Michishita to \"play\" with him. Unable to resist, Michishita readily agrees, kicking off an adventurous encounter that allows him to explore desires he has long suppressed. What starts as an impulsive flirtation in the park blossoms into a passionate connection, leading both men to confront who they truly are inside. Though from vastly different walks of life, Michishita and Abe discover an undeniable bond that may turn into something more.",
