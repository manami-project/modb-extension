Secretly harboring feelings for her, Eita's dreams seem to come true, only to discover that Makina is not who she appears to be.

As Makina makes bold advances towards the inexperienced Eita, he grapples with his feelings and the challenge of maintaining her secret. This risqu√© romantic comedy unfolds as Eita navigates through hilarious situations, trying to keep Makina's true identity under wraps.",
