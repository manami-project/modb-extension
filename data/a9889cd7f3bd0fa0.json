  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Misao's arrival on Tatsumiya Island marks the beginning of a new chapter in the ongoing war between humans and the Festum, a hostile alien race bent on assimilation. Two years have passed since Kazuki and his team of young mech pilots defended the island, leaving the survivors to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives. Kazuki, now partially blind and crippled from his battles, clings to the hope that his fallen friend Soushi will return to the island as promised. But the mysterious boy who arrives on the island is not Soushi, and he brings with him a new threat to both humans and Festum alike. As the Fafner pilots once again risk everything to protect their home, they must confront the possibility that the key to their survival may lie with the very enemy they seek to destroy. With the fate of two races hanging in the balance, the young warriors must find the strength to overcome their fears and fight for a future worth living.",
