  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gi Charat Nyo introduces Dejiko, a princess from a far-off planet, as she embarks on a journey to Earth for her princess training. Alongside her companions, Petit Charat (Puchiko) and a yellow ball named Gema, Dejiko lands in Japan, specifically in the Akihabara district of Tokyo. As they search for a place to stay, they encounter various characters, including the Omocha brothers and an elderly couple, Mr. and Mrs. Ankoro. While Dejiko is expected to follow in her mother's footsteps, she finds herself more drawn to the idea of becoming a pop star. This alternate storyline to the Di Gi Charat series offers a fresh take on Dejiko's background, filled with the same charming and quirky characters that fans have come to love.",
