    "text": "One year after a devastating war, the city of Akihabara attempts to rebuild. Three women - Tsubomi, Anne, and Shizuku - work at a new lingerie pub opened by their former boss. However, during the war, they lost their memories and have started new lives unaware of their pasts. Suddenly, an alien race called the Susano arrive, intent on invading Earth. They transform an unidentified creature into a rampaging monster and unleash it upon Akihabara. As destruction looms, a cat named Rama appears. Rama holds the key to restoring the women's memories and awakening their true powers as magical lingerie-clad warriors known as the Lingerie Soldiers. With the city at stake, Rama helps them regain their memories just in time for them to transform and battle the monster, defending Akihabara from alien conquest. Though the women have found new lives, their warrior destinies cannot be escaped. With the Susano threat looming, the Lingerie Soldiers must stand united against the alien invasion. The fate of Akihabara and Earth hangs in the balance.",
