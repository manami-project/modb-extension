    "text": "World-famous hedgehog, Sonic, and his companion, Chip, find themselves in an eerie, deserted mansion one stormy night while seeking shelter from the relentless rain. Unbeknownst to them, the mansion is inhabited by a trio of mischievous ghosts with a peculiar hobby: capturing photos of terrified visitors to impress their female specter friend. As the ghosts embark on their mission to frighten the duo, Chip proves to be an easy target. However, Sonic's unflappable demeanor presents an unexpected challenge for the spectral pranksters.\n\nThis animated short, titled Sonic: Night of the Werehog, was released on SEGA's website in November 2008 to promote the Sonic World Adventure video game, also known as Sonic Unleashed. As the ghosts join forces to rattle the fearless hedgehog, will Sonic and Chip manage to outwit them, or will the full moon bring forth an unexpected twist to this haunting escapade? Dive into this thrilling adventure and discover the exciting outcome for yourself!",
