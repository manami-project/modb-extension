    "text": "By the close of World War II, Japan found itself divided, with the southern islands under American control and the northern region of Hokkaido, also known as Ezo, annexed by the enigmatic Union. In this alternate reality, a colossal and mysterious tower was erected on Hokkaido, reaching beyond the atmosphere and visible from the northernmost tip of Honshu. In 1996, three teenagers, Hiroki, Takuya, and Sayuri, vowed to unravel the secrets of this tower by constructing an experimental aircraft and flying to the top. However, their ambitious plans were halted when Sayuri fell into a coma and was sent to Tokyo for treatment. Three years later, the trio's unbreakable promise remains, and the truth behind the tower and Sayuri's mysterious condition awaits discovery. As time marches on, will the three friends reunite and fulfill their pledge to explore the tower that once captivated their youthful dreams?",
