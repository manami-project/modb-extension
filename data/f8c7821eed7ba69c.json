    "text": "Zoro's life hangs in the balance as the Straw Hat pirates find themselves in the opulent city of Gran Tesoro, a haven for pirates, Marines, and the wealthy, in \"One Piece Film: Gold.\" Led by the insatiable ambition of the golden emperor, Gild Tesoro, the city appears to be an unstoppable force, immune to the World Government's reach. Lured by the promise of fortune, Luffy and his crew indulge in games of chance, only to find themselves in debt and at the mercy of Gild Tesoro's cunning schemes. With the odds stacked against them, the Straw Hat pirates must rely on their wits and a surprise ally to turn the tables and save their friend before it's too late. The stakes have never been higher in this thrilling, high-flying adventure that could alter the balance of power in the New World.",
