    "text": "High schooler Lim Jugyeong, once a target of bullies due to her plain appearance, discovers the power of makeup to transform her image. After perfecting her skills through online tutorials, she transfers to Saebom High School, known for its tradition of selecting a school goddess who is then scouted by entertainment agencies. Jugyeong quickly becomes a contender for the title, drawing attention from both admirers and rivals, including the two-time goddess Sujin, who harbors a hidden agenda to take Jugyeong down.\n\nDetermined not to be a victim again, Jugyeong engages in a fierce competition while keeping her makeup-free face a secret.

As she navigates the challenges of maintaining her image and dealing with unexpected relationships, Jugyeong embarks on a journey of self-discovery, questioning the true meaning of beauty.\n\nWill Jugyeong emerge victorious in the ruthless world of beauty and popularity, or will she succumb to the pressures?
