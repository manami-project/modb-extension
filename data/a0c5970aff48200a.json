  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Murakami's upcoming anime, 6HP, follows the life of Haruka Hani, a second-year student at Hinomori Gakuen and an aspiring playwright for her school's drama club. As she struggles to complete her script for the school festival, Haruka finds herself constantly encouraged by her childhood friend, Tamaki Teijou. Despite the pressures of her creative endeavors, Haruka remains content with her daily life.\n\nIn the town of Hinomori, where Haruka resides, the residents are frequently under attack by monstrous creatures known as Zaiju. Fortunately, the Heart Princesses are always ready to defend the people from these Beasts of Sin. Haruka has always admired these brave princesses and dreams of one day joining their ranks.\n\nOne fateful day, while working on her script at home, Haruka encounters a mysterious cat named Jin. Sensing her potential, Jin poses an intriguing question: \"You seem to possess the qualities of a princess. What do you think? Would you become a princess?\"\n\nThe first episode of 6HP aired unfinished, with only 22 minutes of animation followed by a behind-the-scenes documentary and an apology from director Takashi Murakami. Murakami plans to release two additional episodes and a completed first episode in the future.",
