Sharing more than just a first name, these two were once connected by an act of heroism when Toujou saved Sawatari and his mother from a menacing motorcycle gang. However, an unfortunate accident during a race threatens to overshadow their past connection, leading them to settle their scores on the race track. As they continue to challenge each other with their exceptional racing skills, the line between rivalry and respect becomes increasingly blurred.
