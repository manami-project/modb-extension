  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After losing her memory in an accident, Sue finds herself living with Torao's family, though she retains an inexplicable desire to become a singer. It is soon revealed that prior to her accident, Sue was actually part of a musical band with her twin sisters. Despite the challenges of her amnesia and long road ahead, Sue remains determined to reconnect with her sisters and reclaim her passion for singing. Inspired by the 1970s novelty song \"Sue Cat Song\", this anime follows Sue's difficult but hopeful journey to recover her lost memories and musical talents. With the iconic track also serving as the show's ending theme, Sue's story taps into themes of identity, family, and chasing one's dreams. Led by veteran voice actress Tsuruoka Yayoi, Sue Cat delivers an uplifting idol tale that predates similar series that found popularity in later years.",
