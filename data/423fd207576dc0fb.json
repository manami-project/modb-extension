  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Government agencies, rival gangs, and data-phantoms disguised as cats - it's all in a day's work for Kagura Total Security (KTS). The team, composed of six unique and eccentric members, is dedicated to eliminating these Phantom Cats before they can wreak havoc on technology. From their fearless leader, Yuka, to their trigger-happy weapons expert, Maki, and their relentlessly abused sole male member, Youichi, the KTS team is a force to be reckoned with.\n\nWhen a mission to trap Phantom Cats takes a dangerous turn, KTS finds themselves in a race against time to rescue one of their own - the kidnapped Maya. With the government's paramilitary anti-phantom cat squad, Hounds, hot on their heels, the team must rely on their wits, their firepower, and their unbreakable bond to get the job done.\n\nFrom explosive car chases to high-stakes hacking, KTS will stop at nothing to bring Maya home safely. But as they delve deeper into the world of Phantom Cats and military hardware smuggling, they begin to realize that the real battle may just be beginning. Will their unconventional tactics and unwavering determination be enough to save the day? Only time will tell.",
