    "text": "Ceremony club rooms may be abandoned, but the spirit of fun and camaraderie is very much alive in the Amusement Club! Middle schooler Akari Akaza, brimming with energy and enthusiasm, joins this peculiar club, reuniting with her childhood friends Kyoko and Yui. With no specific objectives, the club is a sanctuary for the girls to indulge in their wildest ideas and experience the thrill of adolescence. A classmate, Chinatsu, stumbles upon the club, initially mistaking it for the Tea Ceremony Club, and ultimately becomes a member. However, the student council, led by Ayano, has its sights set on shutting down the Amusement Club. Join these four friends as they navigate through their middle school lives, brewing up excitement and laughter in the delightful anime, Yuru Yuri.",
