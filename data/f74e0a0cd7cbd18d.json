    "text": "When soldier Henry returns home, he is devastated to learn that his mother is terminally ill with only months left to live. Although unaware of her pain previously, Henry regrets not treating her better and wants to make amends. Mysteriously, a ghostly figure offers Henry a chance to transfer part of his life to his mother. Henry agrees without hesitation. Remarkably, his mother is not only healed but physically reverted back to her early 20s. However, this miracle comes at a grave cost for Henry. In a similar story, Dong Cuican signs an unusual contract to save his dying mother Yan Jinyu. After her recovery, Yan Jinyu returns to age 20 with exuberant health. Embracing life's possibilities with optimism, she leads an exciting new life. Yet, to shield his mother from worry, Dong Cuican hides his fateful bargain and solitary burden. With abbreviated time left, Dong Cuican is determined to repay his motherâ€™s devotion and atone for past indifference.",
