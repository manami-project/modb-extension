  "synopsis": {
    "text": "12-year-old tomboy Kasuga Eri lives an ordinary life on Earth, until one day when she receives some unexpected visitors - two quirky aliens named Chinpui and Wanderyu from the planet Mahl. They inform Eri that she has been selected as the top candidate to marry the prince of their planet. Eri flatly refuses the outrageous proposal, but the persistent aliens remain determined to convince her to agree. The dog-like Wanderyu and mouse-like Chinpui believe Eri would be the perfect match for their beloved prince and make it their mission to prepare her for royal life on planet Mahl. As the aliens creatively scheme to persuade Eri while adjusting to Earthly customs themselves, humorous chaos and intergalactic antics ensue. Will Eri warm up to the idea of becoming an interplanetary princess bride, or will the aliens' matchmaking plans backfire? Find out in this wacky sci-fi romantic comedy about a girl, aliens, and an accidental interstellar engagement.",
