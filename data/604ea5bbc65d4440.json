  "synopsis": {
    "text": "At Cherryton Academy, a prestigious high school populated by anthropomorphic animals, a delicate balance exists between carnivores and herbivores. When an herbivore student is tragically killed and consumed, the harmony is disrupted, and suspicion falls on Legoshi, a large grey wolf. Despite his intimidating appearance, Legoshi is a gentle soul who insists on his innocence. However, as he struggles to suppress his predatory instincts, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to Haru, a dwarf rabbit. As the pair grow closer, Legoshi grapples with the true nature of his feelings for Haru, all while navigating the mounting tension and distrust between the carnivores and herbivores. In this world where predators and prey coexist uneasily, can love truly conquer all, or will the primal instincts of the beasts within prevail?",
