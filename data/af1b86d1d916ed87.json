  "synopsis": {
    "text": "French maid outfit notwithstanding, Hime Arikawa, a second-year student at Shimoshina High School, finds himself in a precarious situation when debt collectors come knocking for the massive debt left by his absent parents. In a twist of fate, the student council girls swoop in to save him, but their help comes at a price. To pay off his debt, Hime must become the student council's \"dog\" and spend his high school years dressed as a girl.\n\nSurrounded by the eccentric council members, including President Unko, 18-Kin-san, and Beru-senpai, Hime must navigate his new life as a cross-dresser. As he tries to adapt to his new circumstances, he becomes the center of attention for the male students and even finds an unexpected ally in his cross-dressing younger brother, Kaguya.\n\nWith the disciplinary committee hot on his heels and the constant threat of his situation being exposed, Hime must find a way to balance his new life as a cross-dressing student council member while trying to escape the debt collectors' grasp. Will Hime be able to make the best of his situation, or will he crumble under the pressure? Only time will tell in this tragicomic tale of love, laughter, and cross-dressing.",
