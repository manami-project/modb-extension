  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over looked by many, ethereal entities known as Mushi inhabit the world, often causing inexplicable phenomena and affecting human lives in mysterious ways. These beings can manifest as microorganisms, fungi, or even bodies of water, and their presence can lead to extraordinary occurrences such as time loops, living shadows, and telepathy. Enter Ginko, a wandering Mushishi, who dedicates his life to unraveling the enigmatic mysteries of the Mushi. As he journeys from one village to another, Ginko seeks to understand these strange beings and help those afflicted by their influence.\n\nGinko's unique ability to perceive and interact with Mushi comes at a cost: he must remain a nomad, as staying in one place for too long would attract Mushi and endanger those around him. As he delves deeper into the world of Mushi, Ginko discovers that the line between blessing and curse is often blurred, and that the consequences of encountering these entities can be both profound and unpredictable. With a calm and empathetic demeanor, Ginko helps people come to terms with the seemingly impossible, healing wounds they never knew they had and guiding them towards acceptance of their newfound realities.",
