  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime, based on Kodama Kawajirji's essay manga, invites viewers into the laid-back, indulgent world of its female protagonist, Kawashiri. With a penchant for all things alcoholic and a weakness for greasy, salty, and sweet delicacies, Kawashiri's daily life is a testament to her unapologetic love for culinary indulgence. Originally debuting on Twitter in 2020, the series doesn't shy away from portraying Kawashiri's relaxed, less-than-healthy lifestyle, offering a unique and entertaining perspective on life's simple pleasures.",
