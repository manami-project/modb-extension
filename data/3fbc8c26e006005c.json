  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Inuki Kanako's 'Queen's Collection' serves as the inspiration for this chilling tale. The story revolves around Bukida, a young man whose unappealing appearance earns him the disdain of his classmates. Despite this, Bukida harbors deep affection for a girl named Matsuko, leading him to pursue her relentlessly. Even when Matsuko rebuffs his advances, Bukida remains convinced of her hidden affection for him. A tragic turn of events leads to Bukida's untimely death in a traffic accident, bringing Matsuko a sense of relief. However, Bukida's story doesn't end there. He returns as a living corpse, declaring his undying love for Matsuko, even in death. This eerie narrative weaves together themes of unrequited love, rejection, and the supernatural.",
