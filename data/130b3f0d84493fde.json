  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sakura Minamoto is a teenage girl with dreams of becoming a pop idol in Tokyo. However, her hopes are tragically cut short when she is struck by a van and killed. Ten years later, Sakura mysteriously awakens as a zombie in Saga Prefecture, with no memories of her past life. She meets a man named Koutarou Tatsumi, who has resurrected Sakura along with six other zombie girls from different eras. His plan is to revitalize Saga's struggling economy by managing an all-zombie idol group called Franchouchou. Though initially shocked, the girls come to embrace their undead status. They name their group, train together, and perform sold-out shows, striving to rediscover their pasts while keeping their zombie identities hidden. Through heartwarming struggles and plenty of absurd comedy, Franchouchou pursues their goal of saving Saga, proving that zombies can achieve their dreams of stardom. With vivid characters, hilarious hijinks, and an emotional core, Zombieland Saga tells a surprisingly poignant story of friendship, redemption, and what it means to truly be alive.",
