    "text": "Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate return in a brand-new, original story that draws elements from various media, including the manga Nanoha Force and the PsP game Gears of Destiny. This two-part film introduces the Florian sisters, Amitie and Kyrie, residents of the decaying planet Eltria. As their scientist parents struggle to restore their dying world, their father's health deteriorates, and his dream of revitalizing Eltria fades. Desperate to save her family and home, Kyrie journeys to Earth to seize Hayate's Book of Darkness, believing it holds the power to heal her father. Amitie pursues her sister, fearing the lengths Kyrie might go to achieve her goal. As the Florian sisters' conflict unfolds on Earth, Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate must protect their world from this emerging threat while grappling with the consequences of Kyrie's quest for salvation.",
