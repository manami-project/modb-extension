  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fujita Reiji was once a respected curator at the prestigious Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, earning him the nickname \"Professor\" for his expertise. However, conspiracies against him led to losing that position. Now back in Japan, he runs an art gallery called \"Gallery Fake,\" displaying reproductions of famous artworks. But Gallery Fake hides a deeper secret. Rumors swirl that Fujita uses it as a front for black market sales of stolen original paintings. When priceless art goes missing, all eyes turn to Fujita and his shady dealings. One person seeking the truth is Mitamura Sayako, a museum curator intent on exposing Fujita's crimes. However, the story takes an unexpected turn when Sarah, a young woman descended from Arab royalty, enters the picture. It's a stolen painting from her family's collection that brings her together with Fujita. Sarah soon becomes embroiled in the mystery and intrigue as she takes a job as his assistant. With Reiji's talent, Sarah's connections, Sayako's persistence, and the art world's missing masterpieces, events at Gallery Fake threaten to spiral out of control. As secrets unfold, the truth about Fujita and his gallery grows ever more complex.",
