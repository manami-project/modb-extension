  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiding in the shadows of Amsterdam during World War II, Anne Frank, a young Jewish girl, chronicles her life in a diary she affectionately calls Kitty. As Anne turns 13, she and her family, including her older sister Margo and parents, retreat to a secret hideout alongside four others to evade the German menace. For two years, they live in hushed silence, constantly fearing discovery and subsequent deportation to the German crematories.\n\nThrough the pages of her diary, Anne candidly shares her everyday experiences in their clandestine abode, her tumultuous relationship with her mother, and her blossoming first love with a boy named Peter. As time passes, supplies dwindle and tensions rise, but Anne's spirit remains unbroken as she pours her dreams of freedom and fresh air into her diary.\n\nThis poignant tale is a testament to the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity, as seen through the eyes of a young girl. The French adaptation of the original Japanese animated movie by Nagaoka Akinori and Madhouse studio, directed by Julian Y. Wolfe, brings Anne Frank's diary to life in a heart-rending portrayal of hope amidst despair.",
