  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This animated short film explores the complex emotions arising from sibling rivalry. It centers around a young girl struggling to adjust to the new family dynamic after her mother gives birth to a baby sister. Feeling neglected and jealous of the attention her mother showers on the newborn, the girl makes the misguided decision to hide the baby away in darkness. Though misdirected, her actions stem from a place of longing for maternal affection. This poignant film vividly captures the tumultuous feelings of a child vying for a motherâ€™s love. Crafted as a student project, it promises raw and earnest storytelling that may resonate with viewers who have experienced similar insecurities in their own families.",
