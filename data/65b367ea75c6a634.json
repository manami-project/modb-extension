    "text": "Cross Academy is home to an unusual secret - the elite Night Class is comprised entirely of vampires. As Guardians, Yuki Cross and Zero Kiryu are tasked with protecting the Day Class students from learning this truth. However, threats emerge both from within and outside the Academy walls. When Zero mysteriously disappears and then returns changed, Yuki worries what transpired during his absence. Soon after, they are both plagued by disturbing visions, leading Yuki to question Kaname Kuran about her foggy past. Meanwhile, the Vampire Council arrives to punish Zero for killing a pureblood vampire, but Kaname intervenes for opaque reasons. It becomes clear that Yuki's lost memories hold the key to the escalating dangers. As she seeks to uncover her shadowy history and true lineage, sinister external forces secretly manipulate events at the Academy. Yuki and her allies must work to expose the conspiracy and protect the school and students. Torn between her devotion to Kaname and bond with Zero, Yuki's choices will determine critical outcomes.",
