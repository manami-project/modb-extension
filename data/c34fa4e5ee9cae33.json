    "text": "Kotetsu T. Kaburagi, a seasoned superhero known as Wild Tiger, finds himself in a unique world where crime-fighting is not just a noble act, but also a lucrative, televised business. In the bustling city of Stern Bild, superheroes, or NEXT, battle against crime while vying for the top spot on the popular show, HERO TV. When Wild Tiger's popularity wanes, he is compelled to join forces with Barnaby Brooks Jr., an arrogant rookie with a chip on his shoulder. As they navigate their contentious partnership, they must apprehend a formidable thief, a task that tests their abilities and threatens the credibility of all heroes. This movie, the first of two Tiger and Bunny films, expands on the events of the initial TV series episodes with the addition of new scenes.",
