  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the futuristic city of Stern Bild, superpowered heroes known as NEXT use their incredible abilities to fight crime. However, their hero work is also a commercialized form of entertainment, with the heroes promoting sponsors and competing for ratings on the hit TV show \"HERO TV\". Veteran hero Wild Tiger is a seasoned crime fighter, but his powers are fading and his ratings are slipping. He's forced to team up with Barnaby Brooks Jr., an arrogant yet talented rookie hero. Though they clash at first, this odd couple must work together to capture a mysterious thief who's threatening the other heroes and their corporate sponsors. As Wild Tiger and Barnaby take on perilous missions, they begin to gain begrudging respect for one another. Their tumultuous partnership will be put to the test as they race to uncover the thief's true identity. However, along the way, they may discover that becoming a real hero is about more than corporate deals and television ratings.",
