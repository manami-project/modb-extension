  "synopsis": {
    "text": "So aring through the skies, the West Wind carries a unique passenger, Unico, a unicorn with a remarkable gift: the power to spread happiness to all who cross his path. This enchanting ability, however, draws the ire of the jealous gods, who believe that only they should hold such influence over mortal emotions. To remove this perceived threat, the gods decree that Unico must be banished to the desolate Hill of Oblivion, never to be seen again.\n\nThe compassionate West Wind, unable to condemn the innocent Unico to such a fate, defies the gods and embarks on a daring journey, whisking the young unicorn from one magical realm to another. Along the way, Unico encounters a vibrant cast of characters, including Beezel, a mischievous devil child, and Chao, an ambitious cat aspiring to become a witch.\n\nAs Unico forms new friendships and navigates the challenges that come with each new world, he must also confront the looming threat of the vengeful gods. With his newfound allies by his side, Unico embarks on an adventure to protect his friends and save the world from the clutches of darkness. Will Unico's happiness-spreading powers be enough to triumph over the gods' wrath and secure a brighter future for all? Join Unico and his friends in this heartwarming tale of friendship, love, and courage.",
