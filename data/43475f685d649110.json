  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Storyteller's Hour has returned with the sixth season of Yamishibai, where the mysterious, masked Storyteller shares chilling tales of horror and despair deep within a fog-filled forest. The anime is inspired by Japanese urban legends and folklore, with each episode presenting a self-contained story that could happen to anyone, anywhere. From a group of girls who become the targets of a dark entity after bullying one of their own in a cave, to a man who experiences strange occurrences after stealing an umbrella on a rainy day, these eerie tales are sure to send shivers down your spine. As the Storyteller weaves his tales, visitors are drawn in, but they must be careful not to become the subject of his next story. So gather around the kamishibai storyboard and prepare to be thrilled by these macabre tales of supernatural phenomena and mysterious events.",
