  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Katta Kirifuda in the concluding season of the \"Versus\" saga. Previously, Katta had a mysterious \"V\" mark on his forehead which concealed a powerful, uncontrollable force. This was sealed by a band-aid, but now with the band-aid removed, unexpected changes begin to happen. \n\nKatta's pet hamster Hamkatsu suddenly gains the ability to speak. Not only that, but more talking hamsters appear that resemble Hamkatsu. The hamsters reveal the existence of a covert group called the \"Rare Killers\" - their members are transfer students infiltrating Katta's school.  \n\nAs the final battle looms near, the mystery deepens around the talking hamsters and the true motives of the Rare Killers. With the seal broken and all forces gathering, Katta becomes embroiled in events that will lead to an epic confrontation and the climax of the Versus saga.",
