    "text": "At the tender age of 18, Chu Yuan finds himself thrust into the role of emperor, a position that demands constant vigilance and caution. Hailing from a royal lineage, he is acutely aware that a single misstep could cost him everything. No sooner has he ascended the throne than civil unrest erupts in Yun Nan, forcing him to navigate the complex political landscape of his court. The seasoned advisors, each with their own agendas, watch with bated breath as the young emperor grapples with the crisis.\n\nIn the midst of escalating tension between Chu and its neighboring state, Xinan, the rebellion is quelled by none other than Duan Baiyue, the young king of Xinan. His timely intervention earns him the admiration of Chu's citizens, leaving Chu Yuan grappling with a mix of relief and unease. As Xinan's influence grows, whispers of Duan Baiyue's ulterior motives begin to circulate, suggesting a potential power grab. Standing before a winter plum tree, Chu Yuan is consumed by uncertainty, his thoughts drifting to a promise once made. The situation reaches a boiling point when a visiting duke from Ahnu, an ally of Chu, is discovered lifeless in the streets of Chu.",
