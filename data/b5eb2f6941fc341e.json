  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the near future, a select group of people called Adepts have developed extraordinary abilities known as Septimal Powers, which allow them to perform superhuman feats. Though the Japanese conglomerate Sumeragi Group has outwardly brought peace and order to the nation, they secretly capture Adepts and conduct cruel experiments on them. An organization called QUILL discovers the truth behind Sumeragi's facade. One of their members, a young Adept named Gunvolt gifted with electrical powers, infiltrates a Sumeragi facility seeking to free his oppressed people. He is joined in this fight by a girl with mysterious Septimal abilities of her own. Together, they struggle against the corporation's army of security bots and genetically engineered mutants to try and reveal Sumeragi's human rights violations to the world. This is the story of outcasts and rebels raging against an authoritarian near-future society where extraordinary powers are suppressed. It's a fight for exposing the truth and attaining freedom at all costs.",
