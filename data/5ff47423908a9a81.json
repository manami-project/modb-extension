  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To combat the escalating infestation of insects in the near future, which have grown immune to all conventional insecticides, a Japanese corporation has engineered miniature robots known as Hoihoi-san. These robots, standing at just 11.5 cm tall and donning a charming maid appearance, have quickly become a sensation among doll enthusiasts. One such devotee, Dewa Kimiko, who works at a pharmacy, finds her tranquil nights disrupted by the relentless gunfire from her Hoihoi-san as it eliminates insects.\n\nAs the popularity of Hoihoi-san surges, a rival corporation introduces its own line of extermination robots, Combat-san, sparking a new wave of corporate warfare. Not only do these robots target insects, but they also engage in nightly battles against each other, with Combat-san consistently falling short against Hoihoi-san. In the midst of this, Kimiko finds herself increasingly irritated by the robot-obsessed clientele at her pharmacy. Join the thrilling, action-packed world of these pint-sized robots as they wage war against insects and each other in this captivating anime.",
