    "text": "In the pursuit of his childhood dream to become a fighter pilot, Kazuhiro Uchida finds himself on an unexpected path. Assigned to a rescue helicopter unit in a quaint town, far from his familiar surroundings, Kazuhiro's aspirations of soaring through the stratosphere at supersonic speeds are abruptly halted. Initially, he grapples with the harsh realities of his new role, finding it difficult to accept the demanding missions and stern discipline imposed by his seniors. However, as he immerses himself in a series of challenging rescue operations, including airplane accidents, mountain searches, and earthquake relief, Kazuhiro begins to appreciate the value and complexity of his work. Over time, he transforms from a disheartened trainee into a dedicated member of the Komatsu Rescue Squad, redefining his dream and finding purpose in the face of adversity.",
