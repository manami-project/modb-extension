  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takeshi Chimatsuri dreams of following in his famous samurai father's footsteps, but his path to mastery is thrown off course when two alluring twin sisters, Akari and Kagiri Toki, transfer to his school. Seeking to avenge their defeated ninja grandfather, the twins set their sights on reclaiming a stolen family heirloom dagger from Takeshi. Though skilled with a sword, Takeshi's Achilles heel is his extreme anxiety around nude women - a weakness the Toki twins readily exploit with distraction and temptation. To overcome his fears and face the twins' multifaceted attacks, Takeshi enters intense training under his teacher Ms. Ayatsugi and classmates Atsuko and Tora. Lessons in resisting feminine wiles quickly devolve into comic chaos. Yet the twins fight dirty with invisibility potions and brute strength. As the feud intensifies, Takeshi finds his dreams of honorable samurai status threatened by this ongoing conflict. Will he find the courage to face his phobias, or will the twins emerge victorious and bring disgrace upon his family?",
