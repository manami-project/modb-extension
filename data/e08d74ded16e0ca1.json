  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ikko is a 16-year-old boy training to become a Buddhist monk at the Saienji Temple, where he finds himself surrounded by young female trainee priests. After the temple residents win a trip to a secluded rural inn on a game show, they head out for what they hope will be a fun vacation. At the inn, an amusing challenge arises - Ikko must avoid awakening while the girls sleepwalk around him. This proves difficult, as glimpsing the female trainees in revealing situations causes Ikko to temporarily transform into a powerful super-monk. Still, the group is determined to make the most of their short holiday break with humorous activities like outdoor baths, karaoke singing, and playfully teasing one another. Though initially unimpressed by the inn's rustic setting, the friends aim to have a lively and memorable getaway together before returning to train at the temple for the New Year. Their wacky vacation misadventures highlight the comedy and relationships between the quirky temple residents.",
