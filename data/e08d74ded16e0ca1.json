  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ikko Satonaki, a 16-year-old trainee at the Saienji Buddhist Temple, finds himself in the midst of a unique predicament during a New Year's getaway. Winning a trip to a secluded inn through a game show, Ikko and his fellow priestesses-in-training embark on a vacation filled with laughter, karaoke, and rustic outdoor baths. However, the trip takes an unexpected turn when Ikko faces the challenge of remaining asleep while the girls are sleepwalking.\n\nBack at the temple, Ikko's life is anything but ordinary. Surrounded by beautiful female trainees, he must navigate adolescence with an unusual ability: upon seeing a girl naked, he transforms into a powerful super-monk capable of performing colossal exorcisms. As Ikko continues his training under the guidance of his grandmother, the Saienji Priestess, he must balance his teenage life with the responsibilities of a monk, all while managing his unique predicament.",
