As the New Year's Eve festivities approach in Petersburg, Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen, a member of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, is eager to spend some quality time with Sanya V. Litvyak, planning a relaxing city stroll. However, Eila's attempts to invite Sanya are consistently thwarted, causing the pair to drift apart. Amidst the growing tension, an impending Neuroi threat looms over their base, jeopardizing both the squad and the city's celebrations. As Sanya begins to bond with the other girls, Eila's jealousy simmers, but they must all set aside their differences when an armored Neuroi arrives, and they are called upon to defend their home.",
