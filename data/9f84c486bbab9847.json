    "text": "One ordinary family, the Daichis, are on the brink of disintegration. Mom Seiko, disillusioned and materialistic, is pushing for a divorce from her meek, otaku husband Mamoru. Daughter Nozomi, burdened with all the household chores, is feeling unappreciated, while the youngest member, Dai, watches the chaos unfold with a potty mouth. But when the Galaxy Federation selects them to protect Earth from alien threats, the Daichis are catapulted from their mundane lives into a world of intergalactic battles. As they juggle their new roles as Earth's defenders and grapple with their personal issues, will they be able to save the planet and mend their fractured family ties? Join the Daichis as they navigate through space monsters, meteors, and family drama, all while trying to stay within budget and on schedule!",
