    "text": "Kuni Kin and Kuni Mizu, two neighboring kingdoms, have been embroiled in a centuries-long feud over trivial matters, leading to a great wall being erected between them. As the conflict threatens to escalate into war, a divine intervention leads to a peace treaty with an unusual condition: the most beautiful woman from Kuni Kin must marry the wisest man from Kuni Mizu.\n\nAs the rulers of both lands strive to uphold their end of the agreement, they resort to deception. Kuni Kin presents Princess Sara, a compassionate but unremarkable-looking royal, while Kuni Mizu offers Naranbayar, a lanky, humble scholar. To their dismay, the pair are initially presented with animal partners, a dog for Sara and a cat for Naranbayar.\n\nAmidst the political machinations of their respective courts, Sara and Naranbayar's paths cross unexpectedly. As they navigate the intricate web of palace schemes, they forge a connection that transcends their initial misgivings. In this unique twist on a classic fairytale, can their blossoming bond bring lasting peace to the war-weary kingdoms?",
