    "text": "Luo Zheng was once a young master of a prominent family, but after their decline, he was reduced to a menial slave. His sister became imprisoned by a powerful force, leaving him with no choice but to serve others. However, Luo Zheng refused to accept this fate. He came upon an ancient manual left behind by his father that contained mysterious spells capable of transforming a human into a powerful weapon. Determined to resist being defeated, Luo Zheng began refining his body into a formidable instrument of battle. This kicked off his fight against destiny in a world of endless strife among clans vying for supremacy and control over resources and land. Mysterious forces and beings rule this realm rife with conflict. Armed with an unbending will and a body honed into a god-tier weapon, Luo Zheng sets out to stand up for himself and save his sister. As he opens his eyes, a legend ready to challenge the world's strongest beings is born.",
