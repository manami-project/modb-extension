  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hazuma, a hardened private investigator, finds himself in a city gripped by the iron fist of cybernetically-enhanced criminals, following the mysterious vanishing of the legendary cyborg superhero, 8 Man. As Hazuma delves into a case involving a missing scientist and stolen cybernetic technology, he becomes the latest victim of the city's brutal crime wave.\n\nIn a desperate bid to combat the escalating chaos, Professor Tani, the creator of 8 Man, resurrects Hazuma as the new 8 Man using his bio-template. Now, Hazuma must navigate the complexities of his dual existence: maintaining his tough-as-nails detective persona while grappling with the emotionless, super-powered android identity thrust upon him.\n\nAs the reborn 8 Man, Hazuma's memories and personal grudges remain, raising concerns among those around him about the unpredictable fusion of man and machine. With the stakes higher than ever, can Hazuma harness his newfound power to put an end to the city's cybernetic crime epidemic, or will he succumb to the cold, unfeeling nature of 8 Man?",
