  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One-time delinquent and orphan, Joe Yabuki, finds himself at a crossroads after a brush with the law lands him in prison. Upon his release, he discovers a new path as a boxer under the tutelage of coach Dampei, who recognizes his raw talent. However, Joe's initial intentions are less than noble, as he seeks to exploit the opportunity for personal gain. His actions lead him back to incarceration, but Dampei remains steadfast in his belief in Joe, continuing to guide him via correspondence. This abridged remake of the 1980 \"Ashita no Joe\" TV series serves as a refresher for the first season, providing essential backstory for those unfamiliar with the original series or manga before the airing of the second season. Will Joe rise above his past and embrace the world of boxing, or will his questionable choices keep him from reaching his true potential?",
