    "text": "One fateful century ago, the world was plunged into chaos as humans and monsters clashed in an unprecedented war. The monsters emerged victorious, casting a veil of fear and despair over the remnants of humanity. To appease their conquerors, humans are now forced to offer their children as tribute, a grim reality that Bokka, a young high school student, cannot accept.\n\nIn the shadows, a group of valiant warriors known as the Melos continue their resistance against the monsters, driven by the prophecy of the Melody of Oblivion, a phantom girl believed to hold the key to humanity's salvation. Inspired by their courage, Bokka embarks on a journey to join the Melos warriors, discovering along the way his unique ability to hear the elusive Melody of Oblivion.\n\nAs he navigates a world twisted by dark magic and advanced technology, Bokka encounters a myriad of monsters and their human agents, learning the true extent of his powers and the significance of the Melody of Oblivion. With unwavering determination, Bokka vows to rescue the Melody of Oblivion and restore the world's forgotten harmony, one battle at a time.",
