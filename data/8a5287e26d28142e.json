    "text": "Haruhi Suzumiya is an eccentric high school girl who seeks supernatural phenomena and forms the SOS Brigade club to find strange events. She recruits several students into her club, including the cynical Kyon who becomes her closest companion. Together with the shy Mikuru Asahina, bookish Yuki Nagato, and cheerful Itsuki Koizumi, Kyon finds himself dragged into Haruhi's outrageous schemes to uncover mysteries over summer breaks and school festivals. Though Kyon has long stopped believing in such supernatural things, the events surrounding the SOS Brigade have made him question logic. Haruhi herself seems unaware that she possesses tremendous power to change reality according to her desires. Kyon realizes trying to keep her stable is crucial and seems to have a talent for reining in her more extreme ideas. Still, life with Haruhi guarantees bizarre adventures for the SOS Brigade.",
