    "text": "Pleiadian stardust and magic await Subaru, a young girl with a passion for the cosmos, in the anime \"Houkago no Pleiades.\" While preparing for a meteor shower at her school's observatory, Subaru stumbles upon a hidden garden and a peculiar red-haired boy. After the garden vanishes, a whimsical alien creature leads her to a group of girls dressed in enchanting, witch-like attire. As it turns out, her childhood friend Aoi is among them, and they are on a mission to gather scattered pieces of a Pleiadian spaceship engine.\n\nThe little alien, hailing from the Pleiades star cluster, has chosen Subaru to join their after-school club on this magical quest. Eager to help her new extraterrestrial friend return home, Subaru embarks on an adventure to collect the engine fragments, which have been dispersed across the universe.\n\nHowever, they're not alone in their search, as a mysterious adversary is also hunting for the engine pieces. With time running out and the fragments holding immense power, Subaru and her friends must race against the clock to reunite their alien companion with his spaceship. This celestial journey, filled with wonder and excitement, will leave you wishing upon the Pleiades.",
