    "text": "Nanba brothers, Mutta and Hibito, shared a childhood dream of becoming astronauts after witnessing an unidentified flying object soaring towards the moon one summer night in 2006. As adults, their paths diverged: Hibito is now on the verge of becoming the first Japanese astronaut to set foot on the moon, while Mutta finds himself jobless and living with his parents after a heated argument with his boss. Despite the setbacks, Mutta's desire to pursue his dream and surpass his brother never fades.\n\nWhen an opportunity to join the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) arises, Mutta seizes the chance to chase his dream once more. With the help of his family and friends, he embarks on a challenging journey filled with trials and tribulations, aiming to become an astronaut and ultimately set foot on Mars. Alongside newfound friends Kenji and Serika, Mutta faces the arduous path to becoming a space explorer, but with unwavering determination and the support of his loved ones, he just might rekindle the spark that once fueled his childhood dreams.",
