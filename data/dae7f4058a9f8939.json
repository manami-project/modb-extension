    "text": "Shashin, or 'moving picture'), then turns towards the viewer, removes his hat, and offers a salute. This brief, hand-cranked film, spanning merely 50 frames, is believed to be Japan's earliest surviving animation. The film, which was rediscovered in 2005, is estimated to have been created between 1905 and 1912. In the film, a young boy, donning a sailor suit and a vibrant red cap, inscribes the Japanese kanji characters for 'moving picture' on a wall. Upon completion, he faces the audience, doffs his cap, and bows respectfully. Despite many early Japanese films being lost to the devastating Kanto earthquake of 1923, this particular film has endured, making it a significant piece of Japan's cinematic history.",
