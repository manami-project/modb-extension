  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shounan Special Reform School, a bleak institution in post-World War II Japan, becomes the unwelcoming home for six young men, all convicted of minor crimes. In the year 1955, as Japan grapples with the aftermath of war and widespread poverty, these young men find themselves under the merciless watch of a cruel guard and a lecherous doctor, both of whom subject them to unspeakable torments.\n\nAmidst the despair and cruelty, a beacon of hope emerges in the form of Rokurouta, a seasoned inmate and former boxer. With wisdom gained from his own hardships, Rokurouta guides the young men through the trials of their incarceration, teaching them the value of camaraderie and resilience.\n\nTogether, they vow to survive the harsh realities of their confinement and look forward to a brighter future outside the prison walls. But even if they manage to endure their sentences, the world beyond their prison promises its own set of challenges and uncertainties. This is a story of survival, friendship, and the indomitable spirit of youth in the face of adversity.",
