Fast forward six years, and high school student Haruto, a former Subaru member, finds himself face-to-face with Asahi, a dear friend who perished alongside the game. As the former team reunites to solve the mystery behind Asahi's presence, they embark on a thrilling and dangerous journey within Re'Union, ultimately testing the boundaries between reality and the digital realm.
