    "text": "Ikebukuro city is in chaos, plagued by a notorious gang known as the Demon Seed, who wield mecha suits to wreak havoc and commit daring crimes. The local police are outmatched and public support is waning. In a last-ditch effort, the Special Operation Team, led by the eccentric Chief Hattori, devises an unconventional plan to combat the Demon Seed. They seek a charismatic idol singer with extraordinary abilities to become their secret weapon. Enter Maron Namikaze, a 14-year-old girl with a petite frame but incredible superhuman strength. Despite her lackluster singing and dancing skills, Maron is recruited to become the face of the police force and the city's best hope against the Demon Seed. With the stakes high and the odds against her, can Maron rise to the challenge and become the idol hero Ikebukuro needs?",
