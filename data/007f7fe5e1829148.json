    "text": "Having completed all his university courses without officially graduating, Kintarou Ooe embarks on a journey of self-discovery and real-world education, traveling across Japan on his reliable bicycle, Mikazuki 5. As a jack-of-all-trades, Kintarou takes up various part-time jobs, from working at a computer firm and a noodle shop to being an assistant at an animation studio. While his unconventional attitude often lands him in hot water, especially with women, Kintarou's insatiable thirst for knowledge and experience drives him to persist in his quest. Despite the numerous mishaps and misunderstandings that follow him, Kintarou's optimistic spirit remains unbroken, making for a hilarious and enlightening adventure. Will his unique approach to life eventually lead him to success, or will he continue to stumble through the world of work and love? One thing's for sure: it'll be one heck of an educational ride!",
