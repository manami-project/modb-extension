  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story revolves around a young farm boy named Nils Holgersson, who has a penchant for playing cruel pranks on the farm animals. When he pushes his luck too far by capturing the farm's mischievous goblin, he finds himself magically transformed into a miniature version of himself. Now small and vulnerable, Nils becomes the target of the vengeful farm animals, forcing him to flee on the back of a goose named Morten. Together, they join a flock of wild geese and embark on a journey across the beautiful landscapes of Sweden. Throughout their adventure, Nils hopes to discover a way to reverse the spell and return to his normal size.\n\nThis anime is based on the 1982 theatrical version of a 52-episode TV series, featuring a talented production team that worked on both the TV series and the movie. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the chief director, Toriumi Hisayuki, stepped back during the production, leaving Oshii Mamoru to take over the majority of the directional work. Despite being produced as a theatrical release, the movie never made it to the big screen and was ultimately released directly to video as an OVA in 1985.",
