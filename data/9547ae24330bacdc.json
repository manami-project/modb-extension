  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japan's original tale of Dairugger XV unfolds in the year 2200 AD, a time when humanity's thirst for discovery has shifted from the depths of the ocean to the vastness of space. The Terran League, governing body of Earth's future, launches a mission to explore the cosmos, spearheaded by the starship Rugger-Guard. Led by brave explorers Aki, Walter, and Keats, the vessel's three Rugger Teams navigate the cosmos, uncovering remnants of ancient civilizations and charting new worlds.\n\nTheir peaceful mission takes a dramatic turn when they inadvertently cross into the ruthless Galbeston Empire's territory. The explorers find themselves under attack, forcing them to combine their 15 specialized space vehicles, inspired by the sport of rugby, into the formidable super robot, Dairugger XV.\n\nAs the Galbeston Empire teeters on the brink of extinction due to its tyrannical ruler, Dairugger XV rises to the challenge of defending Earth and aiding the oppressed Galbeston citizens in their search for a new home. The fate of two worlds now rests in the hands of this powerful robot and its courageous pilots.",
