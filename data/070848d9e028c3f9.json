  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the daily lives of a group of friends and neighbors living in the Hidamari Apartment complex. When a new family restaurant opens nearby, the friends decide to check it out together and enjoy a meal during some time off from school. Energetic Miyako is determined to sample every drink on the menu. On another occasion, Yuno travels back home to visit family and old friends for a weekend. The friends also decide to have a barbecue party in the apartment courtyard one day, cooking up meat, marshmallows, and even some unconventional ingredients like dried fish. Over the course of the anime, the main group of friends progresses through high school - Yuno and Miyako become second-year students, while Sae and Hiro advance to their third and final year. Additionally, two new students, Nori and Nazuna, move into the apartment complex, joining the circle of friends. Through lighthearted daily adventures and special occasions spent together, the story depicts the joys of youth, friendship, and savoring the little fun moments in life with people you care about.",
