  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Taiwanese residents of the Chianan Plain, living under Japanese occupation in 1917, face a daily battle against drought and famine, with their primary concern being the procurement of water. When Yoichi Hatta, a Japanese civil engineer, presents an ambitious plan to revolutionize the irrigation system, skepticism and disbelief ripple through the community. Xu Yingzhe, a farmer's son, challenges the dismissal of Hatta's proposal and strives to comprehend its potential impact.\n\nDirected by Noboru Ishiguro (The Super Dimension Fortress Macross), this film recounts the true story of Yoichi Hatta, who journeyed to Taiwan in 1910 with a vision to transform the barren southwest through an intricate irrigation system. Despite initial resistance from local farmers, Hatta gains their trust and presses on with the project. However, a tragic tunnel accident brings progress to a grinding halt and deeply rattles Hatta's self-assurance.",
