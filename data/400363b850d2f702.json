    "text": "In mid-19th century Edo, the government has banned all luxuries, including fireworks, causing hardship for professional fireworks maker Seikichi Tamaya. However, Seikichi defiantly continues launching fireworks in secret, aided by the residents of his neighborhood. His dream is to create the biggest, most beautiful firework display ever seen. One night, mystical beasts appear and one escapes thanks to the distraction of Seikichi's fireworks. Soon after, a mysterious girl named Sora asks Seikichi to make fireworks that can reach the moon. Intrigued, Seikichi accepts the challenge, beginning the \"Moon Rocket Plan\" with help from his brother Shunpei and neighbors. As Seikichi works on this fantastical request while evading authorities, questions remain about Sora's identity and the mystical beasts. Will Seikichi succeed in making fireworks that can fly to the moon and make people's dreams come true?",
