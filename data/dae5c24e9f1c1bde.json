Meanwhile, the intergalactic conflict between Medical Mechanica and Fraternity rages on. Enter Hidomi, a disillusioned teenager who believes her mundane life will remain uneventful, until the vivacious Haruko appears as a teacher at her school. Soon after, Medical Mechanica attacks Hidomi's town, and she discovers a hidden power within herself that could save everyone. This power can only be unlocked by Haruko, who still wields her signature Rickenbacker guitar after all these years. As Haruko and Hidomi join forces, intriguing questions remain. Why has Haruko returned to Earth? What is the significance of the humanoid robot Canti, who has disappeared since Naota's childhood adventure?
