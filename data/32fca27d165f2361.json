  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the guise of typical exchange students, Ryo, Koji, and Gawl embark on a covert mission to alter the course of history. Their objective: halt a perilous genetic research project that leads to the creation of 'generators,' artificial life forms with devastating consequences. Gawl, a boy with the extraordinary ability to transform into a formidable creature, is their trump card in this high-stakes game. As they juggle their secret mission with the mundane tasks of attending classes at Oju Academy and keeping their landlord's inquisitive daughter at bay, they must confront the looming threat of generators from the future. These mechanical life forms have traveled back in time to thwart their efforts, pushing Gawl to become the very entity he despises. The fate of humanity rests on their shoulders as they strive to prevent a catastrophic war triggered by these genetically enhanced beings. Will their combined efforts be enough to change the course of history and save their world?",
