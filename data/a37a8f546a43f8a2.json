    "text": "Horieâ€™s father, a renowned erotic author, chose her name based on a provocative pun: 'A' for apple and 'O' for orgy. To escape the shadow of her father's scandalous reputation and secure a place in a top-tier university, Horie dedicates herself to her studies, leaving no room for romantic distractions. However, her plans are disrupted when her charming classmate, Kijima, confesses his love for her. As she struggles to shake off his advances, she finds herself plagued by impure thoughts, making it clear that her father's influence runs deeper than she realized. Can she resist Kijima's charms and stay focused on her academic goals, or will she succumb to the temptations that threaten to derail her plans?",
