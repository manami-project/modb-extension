    "text": "Custom Cast's Virtual Real idol unit takes center stage in this unique 3DCG anime, featuring the quirky antics of various VTubers. From Mirai Akari, the overly enthusiastic VTuber with a penchant for inappropriate jokes, to Siro, the cyber girl with a questionable past, each character brings their own brand of humor to the table. Joining them are Hime Tanaka and Hina Suzuki, the rhythmic duo known as HimeHina, as well as the lazy FPS-loving Nekomiya and the self-important Tsukino Mito. With an omnibus sketch comedy format, each episode highlights different VTubers in absurd situations, from parody space adventures to bizarre skits involving bouncing gorillas. The anime also features fan-submitted characters made with the Custom Cast mobile app, adding an extra layer of community engagement. Virtual-san wa Miteiru is a one-of-a-kind comedy that showcases the personality and charm of VTubers, certain to bring delight to any fan of virtual characters.",
