    "text": "Shindou Iu, Hakozaki Kusue, and the aloof yet logical Yotsuya Yuusuke find themselves in a game-like alternate reality, where they must navigate perilous quests and outsmart cunning adversaries. As they progress, the trio becomes a quintet with the addition of Keita Torii and an old ally, Kahabell. Their journey takes them to Cortonel, where they discover that time has moved differently, with 15 years having passed.\n\nThe group's next challenge leads them to Jiffon Island, where they must help the locals prepare for the Vaikdamnia festival. However, the island is overrun by orcs, who have struck a sinister deal with the inhabitants. In exchange for sparing the islanders, the orcs demand the sacred Jiffon Buffalos, which are crucial for the festival. With the buffalo population dwindling and the festival just 11 days away, Yuusuke and his team must eliminate the orc threat and secure the buffalos.\n\nAs they strive to complete their mission, Yuusuke grapples with the shocking revelation that their actions in this world have real-life consequences. With lives on the line, the group must work together to protect the islanders, ensure the success of the festival, and advance their ranks in this treacherous game.",
