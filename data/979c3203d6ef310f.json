  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Morgana, a ruthless supervillain, and Lupin III, a cunning thief, both set their sights on the precious Japanese artifact known as 'Jigoku Nyorai Zo,' hidden within a Nazi Germany recreation facility. In the ensuing chaos of the heist, Inspector Zenigata, Lupin's relentless pursuer, meets a tragic end at the hands of Morgana, who also seizes the coveted Buddha statue.\n\nLupin's true objective, however, is the Naraka Tathagata, a small Buddhist figurine that holds the secret to unlocking Fujin, an ancient and powerful treasure of the Fuma ninja clan. Asuka, a beautiful ninja descendant of the Fuma clan, enlists Lupin's help to find Fujin. But the path to the treasure is fraught with danger, as Morgana's ninja organization and the seductive Fujiko Mine both seek to claim Fujin's power for themselves.\n\nWith Zenigata no longer a threat, Lupin, his trusted allies Jigen and Goemon, and the newly allied Asuka must navigate a treacherous world of ninja clans and double-crosses to reach Fujin before their ruthless adversaries. The race is on to unlock the secret of Fujin and determine who will ultimately wield its ancient power.",
