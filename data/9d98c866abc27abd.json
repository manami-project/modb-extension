  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Drag-Rides, ancient mechanical dragons unearthed from ruins worldwide, are now the weapons of choice for the nobility, trained at the prestigious Royal Knight Academy. Lux, the deposed prince of the fallen Arcadia Empire, finds himself in a precarious situation when he accidentally encounters Lisesharte, the new princess of the Kingdom of Atismata, in a compromising situation. Enraged, Lisesharte challenges Lux to a Drag-Ride duel, setting off a series of events that could unravel the hidden secrets of both royal lineages.\n\nOnce known as the strongest Drag-Knight, Lux has earned a new reputation as the 'undefeated weakest' due to his unwillingness to attack during battles. After his fateful duel with Lisesharte, Lux unexpectedly finds himself attending the female-only Royal Knight Academy, a school dedicated to training royals in the art of Drag-Ride warfare. As Lux navigates his new surroundings, he could potentially expose the dark truths lurking within both the Arcadia Empire and the Kingdom of Atismata.",
