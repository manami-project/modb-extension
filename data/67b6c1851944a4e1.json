  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now, in an alternate reality, Japan's Flesh Inc. has mastered the art of creating zombies using voodoo techniques imported from Africa during the booming Sixties. Zombies have become the latest craze, a versatile resource used in everything from instant noodles and soft drinks to hamburgers, pet food, and even cosmetics. Flesh Inc. has amassed a fortune by exploiting this new trend, offering a wide range of products derived from the undead.\n\nOn their first day of work, a trio of self-absorbed millennials find themselves trapped in a fully automated zombie farm with their old-fashioned supervisor. As a horde of undead begins to run wild, the group must put aside their generational differences and work together to survive. In this thrilling anime short film, Walking Meat, the tables have turned, and zombies are now the hunted rather than the hunters. Will the group make it out alive, or will they become the latest addition to Flesh Inc.'s product line?",
