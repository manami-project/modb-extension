    "text": "Jin's popular vocaloid song series features IA and Hatsune Miku as the singers, with music videos created mainly by Sidu and Wannyanpu. This anime encompasses official music videos published on the Mekakucity Days DVD. The music videos tell stories about members of the 'Mekakushi-dan' group. Kagerou Daze focuses on Hibiya's desperate attempts to prevent tragedy from befalling Hiyori on a hot summer day. Headphone Actor shows Takane racing to survive the apocalypse by following mysterious instructions. Souzou Forest explores Mari's isolated life and her dreams of the outside world. Konoha no Sekai Jijou depicts Konoha's fragmented memories of a boy and girl who faced summer tragedy. Finally, Toumei Answer reveals Shintarou's ennui and his reaction to Ayano's attempts to shake up his repetitive life. Though covering a variety of characters and stories, the videos are united through their stylized animation, vocaloid music, and exploration of fate's role in shaping summer days.",
