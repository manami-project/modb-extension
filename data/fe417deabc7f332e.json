  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shindou Hikaru, an ordinary 12-year-old, stumbles upon an antiquated Go board tucked away in his grandfather's attic, unwittingly awakening the spirit of Fujiwara no Sai, a legendary Go player from the Heian era. Haunted by Sai, Hikaru reluctantly agrees to become the vessel for the spirit's unquenchable desire to play Go once more. As they embark on this extraordinary journey, Hikaru discovers his own passion for the game while helping Sai pursue his quest for the elusive 'Hand of God' â€“ the perfect move.\n\nTheir unique partnership faces challenges as the rules and strategies of Go have evolved significantly since Sai's time. Together, they must navigate the competitive world of modern Go, encountering formidable opponents like the young prodigy Touya Akira. Based on the captivating manga by Yumi Hotta and Takeshi Obata, this tale of ambition, friendship, and self-discovery unfolds as Hikaru and Sai strive to leave their mark on the Go community and find the peace that has eluded Sai for centuries.",
