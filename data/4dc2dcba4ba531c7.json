  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Maison du Wish, located on the fringes of Tokyo, is the new home for Yurume Aida, an ambitious 18-year-old high school graduate with dreams of attending Tokyo University. This apartment complex, however, is not your typical living space. It's a hub for 'ronin' - students who, like Yurume, are preparing for their college entrance exams after having failed previously. Despite the complex's dubious reputation - none of its residents have ever passed the entrance exams - Yurume remains hopeful. Leaving behind her old apartment and its unmotivated neighbors, Yurume embarks on a journey to break the curse of Maison du Wish and secure her place at Tokyo University. Will she be the first to defy the odds and pass the entrance exams? Only time will tell.",
