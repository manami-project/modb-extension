After losing his job, his girlfriend, and nearly his life, Robby finds himself pursued by debt collectors. In a twist of fate, he crosses paths with Hatchi Kita, an 18-year-old part-time worker who helps retrieve his stolen bag. Despite their differences, the two briefly bond over a meal before parting ways. However, Hatchi reappears as a debt collector working for loan shark Yan, sparking a thrilling cat-and-mouse chase. Robby seizes the opportunity to escape to space, hoping to find solace on Isekandar, a legendary planet rumored to bring happiness. But unbeknownst to him, Hatchi has stowed away on his spaceship, leading to an unexpected galactic adventure together in search of the elusive Isekandar.",
