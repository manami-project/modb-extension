  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a mysterious plague wipes out an entire village in feudal Japan, a masterless swordsman named Jubei Kibagami finds himself entangled in a dangerous web of political intrigue and supernatural powers. When he rescues a female ninja, Kagero, from a man with a stone-like body, Jubei becomes a target of the Devils of Kimon, a group of ninja with extraordinary abilities. To make matters worse, a government spy poisons Jubei and promises him an antidote if he uncovers the true intentions of the Devils of Kimon and their connection to the plague.\n\nAs Jubei and Kagero delve deeper into the mystery, they uncover a plot to overthrow the government and encounter shadow leaders and a man from Jubei's past. With the fate of all of Japan in their hands, Jubei, Kagero, and an unlikely ally - a perverted old monk - must face an enemy who is virtually immortal. Can Jubei and his allies unravel the blood-soaked clues and stop the Shogun of the Dark and his fearsome force of demonic henchmen before it's too late? Prepare for an insanely gore-packed, action-filled journey through a surreal and devil-infested ancient Japan.",
