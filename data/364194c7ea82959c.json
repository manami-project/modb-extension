  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sharaku is a descendant of an ancient, technologically advanced race of three-eyed humans who once ruled the world. He possesses great intelligence and power, but also a sinister, evil nature when his third eye is uncovered. The kind-hearted Wato is the daughter of a local priest who finds herself drawn to Sharaku's powerful side, acting as his protector. However, when Sharaku's third eye is covered, his personality transforms into that of a sweet, innocent child lacking memories of his mighty self. In this helpless state, Wato feels compelled to care for him maternally. The popular manga \"The Three-Eyed Boy Comes Here\" was adapted into an animated film, representing a tonal departure from earlier entries in the series. Sharaku and Wato embark on an entertaining nautical adventure, investigating a mysterious shipwreck and navigating strange islands along their voyage. With a priority on adventure over complex themes, the lighthearted film garnered controversy, ultimately leading the series' original production company Tezuka Productions to withdraw from future adaptations. Nonetheless, this eccentric island-hopping quest of the formidable three-eyed boy and his steadfast companion is sure to provide viewers with a fun escape.",
