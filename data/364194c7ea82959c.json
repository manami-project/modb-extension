  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tezuka Osamu's original story, \"The Three-Eyed Boy Comes Here,\" takes an exciting turn in this animated adaptation produced by Toei Animation Co., Ltd. The adventure follows Sharaku, a descendant of an ancient, powerful three-eyed race, and Wato, the daughter of a local priest, as they explore a mysterious old ship and embark on a thrilling sea voyage around peculiar islands.\n\nSharaku, with his extraordinary intelligence, possesses both a benevolent and malevolent side, depending on whether his third eye is covered or not. When his third eye is visible, he becomes an evil, formidable force, smitten with Wato, who reciprocates his feelings and seeks his protection. However, when his third eye is concealed, he transforms into a clueless, innocent child, requiring Wato's maternal care and guidance.\n\nThis animated film diverges from Tezuka Productions Co., Ltd.'s previous thematic approach, focusing more on entertainment factors to captivate viewers and immerse them in Sharaku and Wato's extraordinary journey. Prepare for a rollercoaster of emotions and unexpected twists as the duo navigates the enigmatic waters surrounding the strange islands.",
