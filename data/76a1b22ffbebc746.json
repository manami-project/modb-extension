  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Life in a serene forest, filled with a diverse community of birds, squirrels, and magical beings, is disrupted by the intrusion of humans and their destructive machinery. In this voiceless narrative set to Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony, the forest's inhabitants must face the harsh realities of deforestation and the ruthless actions of one man wielding a chainsaw.\n\nThe story follows a courageous squirrel, born and raised in this idyllic forest, as he confronts the challenges posed by the invading humans. Despite the imminent danger, the squirrel must protect his newborn offspring and defend his home from the thoughtless destruction.\n\n'Legend of the Forest', produced by Tezuka Productions in 1987, is an innovative animation that explores the environmental impact of deforestation. The animation, a tribute to the pioneers of American animation, is a testament to Tezuka Osamu's unique style, taking more than a decade to complete. The powerful combination of Tchaikovsky's music and Tezuka's artistry creates a compelling narrative that highlights the struggle of the forest's inhabitants against human encroachment.",
