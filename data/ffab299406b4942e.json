  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Federation outpost Fort Casey comes under attack by a swarm of Arachnids, an insectoid alien species. The fast attack ship Alesia is dispatched on a rescue mission to evacuate the survivors from Fort Casey and retrieve vital military intelligence. However, the evacuation starship John A. Warden, now under the command of Carl Jenkins from the Ministry of Paranormal Warfare, mysteriously disappears into a nebula during a covert mission, prior to rendezvousing with the Alesia. A squad of battle-hardened troopers from the Alesia, led by Lieutenant Tony Daughtery, is now tasked with finding the missing John A. Warden. Accompanied by Captain Carmen Ibanez, they discover the ship has been overrun by Arachnids under the control of their Queen. With the John A. Warden now on course to Earth, carrying this immense threat, Daughtery's team faces a race against time to stop the Arachnid Queen before she can unleash her forces on humanity's homeworld. The odds are stacked against them, but they must prevail to save Earth from invasion.",
