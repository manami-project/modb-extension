  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A few months ago, a major incident called the End-of-Year Great Disaster occurred when monster-like beings called Aradama and their leader Tagitsuhime caused destruction in Tokyo. Since then, peace has returned but the threat of Aradama still looms, as they have been appearing more frequently than ever. Mihono Asakura is part of a special investigations team searching for lost swords called Okatana, which can defeat the Aradama. When not working, Mihono spends most of her time training as a sword-wielding shrine maiden called a Toji. Her team soon receives orders to help two other Toji - Kanami Etou and Hiyori Juujou - pursue a humanoid Aradama that has escaped them in Enoshima. This Aradama turns out to be more than they expected. In this world, Toji have existed since ancient times to exorcise supernatural threats like the Aradama using their swords. They serve within a special police force and attend one of five training schools across Japan. Every spring, the top Toji representatives from each school compete in a tournament to showcase and improve their skills. Now, the next tournament brings together the most skilled Toji, who rigorously prepare themselves for the impending competition.",
