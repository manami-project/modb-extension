  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a mysterious new 7G network technology is launched, reality is overwritten and Japan descends into chaos. Two years later, one of the few remaining settlements is the town of Agano, where residents aged 21 and over have transformed into anthropomorphic animals. High school student Shizuru Chikura discovers a photo of her missing friend Youka Nakatomi in a deserted area called Ikebukuro. Determined to find Youka, Shizuru enlists the help of Tairo Zenjirou, an eccentric old train conductor, to teach her how to operate Agano's abandoned train. On the day of departure, Shizuru's classmates Nadeshiko, Reimi, and Akira impulsively decide to join her risky journey into the unknown. As the group travels beyond Agano for the first time aboard their \"Doomsday Train,\" they discover a world filled with dangers and distortions far exceeding anything in their wildest imaginations. Their one hope is that the tracks will lead them to answers about their missing friend and the mysteries behind 7G â€” if they can survive long enough to reach the final stop.",
