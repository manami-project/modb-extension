  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Brothers Kakugo and Harara Hagakure stand as humanity's last hope in a dystopian 21st century, where monstrous creatures and ruthless demons have overrun Earth. Trained in the lethal Zero fighting technique by their father, they wield living armor imbued with the spirits of ancient warriors, battling the savage forces that threaten the remnants of mankind.\n\nHowever, darkness lurks within Harara, leading him to murder their father and assume Kakugo's demise. Destiny reunites them as Kakugo, driven to protect the survivors in a decimated city, confronts his deranged brother. Their reunion ignites the century's bloodiest conflict, redefining the term \"sibling rivalry.\"\n\nIn the ruins of New Tokyo, Kakugo wanders alone, battling the minions of a greater evil from his past. As he strives to restore order and security, he discovers that these monstrosities are merely pawns in a larger, deadlier game.\n\nOn a battlefield littered with decaying skulls and bones, the brothers prepare to clash. Harara, intent on eradicating the human plague, faces Kakugo, who stands united with his living armor and the people of Earth. Both masters of the Zero Form arts, a single touch could end the fight in this high-stakes duel.",
