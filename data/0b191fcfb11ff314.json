    "text": "Kinu, Shinichi, and a host of other vibrant characters welcome Sunao Konoe as she steps into a new chapter of her life at a different high school. With a burning passion for theatre ignited in her childhood, Sunao's ultimate goal is to establish a theatre club at her new school. However, the obstinate student council president, Erika, stands in her way, making Sunao's dream seemingly unattainable.\n\nAs she navigates through the challenges set by Erika and her council, Sunao crosses paths with her childhood friend, Leo, who once supported her theatrical ambitions. Despite the unexpected reunion, Leo's playful nickname for Sunao, \"radish,\" only serves to fuel her determination to prove herself on stage.\n\nWith Otome, a former council member, now an ally and mentor, Sunao begins to win over those who once dismissed her as a mere \"theatre freak.\" However, Sunao remains unaware of the true obstacle she must face on her journey to bring her dream to life.\n\nIn this engaging tale of perseverance, friendship, and self-discovery, will Sunao triumph over the odds and finally create the theatre club she's always desired? Only time will tell if her unwavering determination will lead to the realization of her dream.",
