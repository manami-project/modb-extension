    "text": "It's been a year since Neil Bowman, a kind-hearted demon, left home to live in the human world. He's settled into room 1031 on All Saints Street, sharing his life with a motley crew of non-human roommates, including a vampire named Ira, angels, and mummies. Despite the chaos that comes with such an unusual living arrangement, Neil has grown to cherish his new friends and considers his new home a sanctuary.\n\nHowever, his already tumultuous life takes a turn for the worse when his brother, Nick, pays him a visit from hell. Nick's intentions are far from innocent, as he seeks to awaken the slumbering power of the Demon King within Neil. To make matters worse, Nick shows no signs of leaving anytime soon and has no qualms about causing disruptions in Neil's life.\n\nAmidst all this chaos, Neil finds solace in the company of an innocent angel named Lily. Despite his attempts to keep their outing a simple picnic, it quickly escalates into a group event, leading to unexpected dangers. With his brother's suspicious behavior and the growing threats around him, Neil's dream of living a peaceful life in the human world seems further away than ever. Will Neil be able to navigate through this web of suspicion, betrayal, and conspiracy to find the ordinary life he desires? Only time will tell in this extraordinary tale of non-ordinary beings.",
