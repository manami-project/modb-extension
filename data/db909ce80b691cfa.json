  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A Korean medical student named Sangmin volunteers abroad in Nepal, where he encounters Sita, a former Kumari (a girl worshipped as a goddess vessel). Despite the barriers between them, Sangmin and Sita fall deeply in love. They marry and briefly enjoy marital bliss in Korea, before Sita tragically passes away after only a year. Desperate to regain his lost love, Sangmin begs the gods to revive Sita, and his prayers are miraculously answered. However, this second chance comes at a great cost. Sangmin finds himself mysteriously transported back to Nepal, now aged beyond his years. Before him stands Sita as a young girl, with no memories of their prior life together. It becomes apparent that the lovers are bound by a profound destiny that transcends a single lifetime. As Sangmin contends with the gods to change Sita's fate and the course of reincarnation itself, her origins as a revered Kumari come to light. Their intertwined souls are drawn together across space and time by love that will not rest until justice is done. Despite the monumental struggle ahead, Sangmin pursues the slender hope that he and Sita may one day reunite joyfully as partners, unencumbered by divine tragedy.",
