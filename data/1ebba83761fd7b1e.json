  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows Jingoro Hidari, a legendary one-armed craftsman living during the Edo period in Japan. After being betrayed by his senior apprentices which resulted in the loss of his right arm and his foster parent, Jingoro embarks on a revenge journey with his sidekick \"Sleeping Cat\" and a mechanical prosthetic arm replacing his lost limb. Known for his artistic talents and ability to skillfully use carpentry tools with only his left arm, Jingoro earned the nickname \"Hidari\" which means \"left\" in Japanese. As he seeks vengeance, Jingoro finally confronts one of the men involved in his betrayal, Inumaru, which leads to a climatic fight to the death between them. This synopsis is based on a pilot film for an upcoming stop-motion animated movie featuring hand-carved wooden puppets. The film aims to bring to life the legendary story of sculptor Hidari Jingorou through an action-packed and dramatic narrative.",
