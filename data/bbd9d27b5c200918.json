    "text": "She athing his legendary sword Excalibur, the valiant hero Sion sets out to reseal the crumbling barrier between the human realm and the demon dimension. But an untimely end befalls him, courtesy of a booby trap set by Touka, an unassuming and slightly lewd farmer. In a twist of fate, Touka finds himself inhabiting Sion's body after a necromancer, Anri, intervenes to preserve the mission to save the world.\n\nJoined by his childhood friend Yuna, the unlikely trio embarks on a perilous journey to restore the seal and prevent the demonic onslaught. With the weight of the world on his shoulders and the lingering stench of Sion's decaying body, Touka must rise to the challenge and become the hero he once only dreamed of being. Can this unconventional group succeed where the legendary hero fell short, or will they succumb to the darkness that threatens to consume them all? Only time will tell in this thrilling and comedic tale of heroism, friendship, and redemption.",
