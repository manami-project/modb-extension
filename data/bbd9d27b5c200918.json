  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a realm plagued by demonic forces, the legendary hero Sion stood as humanity's final defense, wielding the holy sword Excalibur to keep the Gates of Hell sealed shut. However, the seal has begun deteriorating, allowing demons to slip back into the world and wreak havoc. Sion journeys forth to reinforce the seal, but meets an untimely end after falling into a pitfall trap laid by Touka, a selfish yet unassuming farmer focused only on protecting his radish crop. In a panic, Touka hides Sion's body, only to later find his soul transferred into the fallen hero's corpse. With Sion gone, the responsibility of saving the world falls onto Touka's reluctant shoulders. Thankfully, he's not alone - Anri, a powerful necromancer and Sion's former ally, binds Touka's soul to reanimate the hero's body. She and Touka's childhood friend Yuna agree to accompany him on his quest to reseal the Gates of Hell before the demons gain too much ground. Despite inhabiting Sion's legendary form, Touka feels unprepared to live up to the mighty hero's legacy. His allies' support keeps Touka steady as he copes with his new reality. Together, the unlikely trio embarks on an epic journey to defeat the demonic forces and determine the fate of humanity.",
