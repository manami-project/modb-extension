  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One sunny day, Kodaka Hasegawa, a transfer student with a delinquent-like appearance due to his blond hair, crosses paths with his ill-tempered and solitary classmate, Yozora. Catching her in a one-sided conversation with an imaginary friend, the two realize their shared lack of genuine friendships. In an attempt to remedy this, they establish 'Rinjinbu,' or The Neighbours' Club, with the express purpose of befriending fellow loners through group activities such as cooking and games.\n\nAs the club grows with equally relationship-challenged members, they decide to put their newfound camaraderie to the test by hosting a nabe (hot pot) party. However, the event takes an unexpected turn when the soup base becomes a monstrous concoction of various ingredients, transforming their friendly gathering into a battle of resilience. Despite the chaos, the Neighbours' Club remains determined to learn the art of socializing, using this nabe party as a practice round for potential future invitations. Will this eccentric group of misfits manage to build lasting friendships, or will their differences ultimately drive them apart?",
