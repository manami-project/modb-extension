  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The 1979 Chinese animated film \"Prince Nezha's Triumph Against Dragon King\" tells the story of the warrior deity Nezha from Chinese mythology. After an unusual 3.5 year pregnancy, Lady Yin gives birth to a flesh ball that transforms into a lotus flower, from which Nezha emerges, able to walk and talk. Nezha becomes a student of the immortal Taiyi Zhenren. Meanwhile, the Dragon Kings of the Four Seas, having grown cruel and destructive, plague China with storms and drought. The East Sea Dragon King Ao Guang sends his yaksha Ye Sha to capture children to eat. Ye Sha captures Nezha's friend, prompting a confrontation where Nezha badly injures him. Further battles ensue between Nezha and Ao Guang, with the Dragon Kings causing natural disasters across China. Seeing the people's suffering, Nezha commits ritual suicide, then is reborn with new weapons and abilities. He breaks into Ao Guang's palace and finally defeats the Dragon Kings, triumphing over their destructive reign. Originally screened at the 1980 Cannes Film Festival, this Chinese film brings ancient mythology to life through vivid animation. Epic in scope, it depicts one deity's heroic quest to liberate the people by defeating merciless forces of nature.",
