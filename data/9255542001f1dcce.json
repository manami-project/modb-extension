  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Suzukaze Sota, an ordinary boy with an extraordinary secret, finds himself at the center of a grand tale spanning two distinct worlds. In a time long past, humans wielded both science and magic, but fearing their limitless potential, a divine being divided the world into two realms, one governed by science and the other by magic. Sota, unbeknownst to him, possesses the key within him to reunite these realms.\n\nWhen Sota encounters an injured wolf near his home, he inadvertently triggers a chain of events that plunges him into a world of danger and adventure. The wolf, named Val, is no ordinary creature, but a magical being capable of speech. Accompanying Val is Akazukin, a fierce warrior donning a red helmet, who hails from the magic realm. Together, they are on a mission to protect the key from the clutches of the nefarious witch, Cendrillon.\n\nAs Sota's dreams of monstrous pursuits begin to seep into his reality, he and his friend Ringo are drawn into a battle that transcends worlds. With Ringo's kidnapping by Cendrillon's minions, the stakes are raised, and the race to protect the key intensifies. Will Akazukin's strength and valor be enough to save Ringo and safeguard Sota's world from Cendrillon's evil grasp? The stage is set for a thrilling journey filled with magic, mystery, and high-stakes battles.",
