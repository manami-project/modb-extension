    "text": "In the near future, litter picking has become a popular competitive sport called \"SpoGomi.\" Akari is a quiet, unassuming student who cares deeply about the environment. One day she meets Tokio, a talented and charismatic SpoGomi athlete admired by all. Though very different, Akari and Tokio discover a shared passion for cleaning up litter and protecting nature. As they compete together in SpoGomi contests, they meet young people from around the world who are also dedicated to eliminating garbage from streets, rivers, and oceans. United by their common goal, these youths have adventures and learn important life lessons during their coming-of-age journeys. With the anime produced in multiple languages, it has the potential to spread an inspirational message globally: young people can make a difference, and together we can build cleaner, greener communities. At its heart, this is an uplifting story about finding purpose, making friends, and taking action to better society and the planet.",
