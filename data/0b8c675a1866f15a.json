  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mathias was once Gaius, the world's most powerful sage, but his magical abilities were limited by the crest he was born with. Though adept at creation magic, he yearned to master combat magic as well. Knowing that one's crest was immutable, Gaius decided to reincarnate in hopes of being reborn with a more suitable crest. A thousand years later, Gaius was reborn as Mathias Hildesheimer, the third son of a duke. To his delight, Mathias had the optimal crest for magical combat. However, he soon discovered that magic had deteriorated over the centuries, with arcane knowledge all but lost. Moreover, crests now signified something different - and Mathias' was considered the weakest, dubbed the \"Crest of Failure.\" Though disheartened, Mathias refused to accept his fate. Enrolling in the Second Academy, he rapidly excelled in his studies, demonstrating magical aptitude that exceeded all expectations. But Mathias uncovered a disturbing truth - the demons who had caused magic's decline. Determined to remedy the consequences of his long absence, Mathias set out to confront these threats to humanity, intent on reclaiming his rightful place as the world's strongest sage.",
