  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's a firm believer in magic, a young girl named Arusu who finds herself inexplicably transported to a world brimming with enchantment and wonder. At first glance, it seems like a dream come true, but the reality is far darker than she could have ever imagined. The magical realm is governed by a powerful coven of witches, who use the native magical creatures, sprites, as slaves for their own selfish purposes. Arusu, alongside her newfound witch friends Sheila and Eva, is blamed for the release of the witches' magical source - the very sprites they've enslaved. Tasked with recapturing the freed sprites, Arusu takes it upon herself to challenge the status quo and teach her fellow witches that magic should be a force for good, spreading joy and happiness to all. In this fantastical world, Arusu's unwavering belief in the power of magic might just be the key to changing everything.",
