  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokine Amino works as a secretary at the advertising agency TEN2. One day while preparing the conference room for an important client meeting, Tokine finds herself transported to a strange alternate dimension ruled by a creature named Hacchin. Hacchin explains that this world is called \"Quizun\" and that Tokine must solve puzzles and riddles within a time limit in order to earn \"Q-Stones\" and eventually return to her own world. Though confused by the situation, Tokine remains remarkably calm and agrees to play along, solving the first riddle that will allow her to exit. It seems Hacchin has chosen Tokine specifically for her intelligence and puzzle-solving capabilities. Now Tokine faces the possibility of being randomly summoned to Quizun at any time, forced to solve puzzles while wearing a special suit that enhances her reasoning skills. Though already overburdened as a secretary, Tokine hides her secret double life from all but her closest friends at work. With her love of puzzles and sharp intellect, she prepares to take on the challenges of Quizun whenever she is called upon.",
