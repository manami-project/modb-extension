    "text": "Tessaiga's ultimate attack mastered, InuYasha, Kagome, Shippo, Sango, and Miroku continue their relentless pursuit of the Shikon Jewel shards. But a sudden event triggers the resurrection of a formidable demon, Menoumaru, son of the once-sealed Hyoga. Craving the might of Tessaiga for a sinister purpose, Menoumaru cunningly manipulates InuYasha and gains unparalleled power. With his loyal demoness followers, Ruri and Hari, he wreaks havoc, turning allies into enemies and love into hate. InuYasha and his friends must now confront this seemingly invincible adversary, awakened by a Shikon shard, to prevent Japan from being engulfed in darkness. Can InuYasha surpass his father's legacy and vanquish this new threat, or will Menoumaru's twisted ambitions endanger both their era and the distant future?",
