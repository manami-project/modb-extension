    "text": "Hennako-chan is a black comedy comic series aimed at adult audiences. The story follows an eccentric elementary school girl named Hennako who possesses powerful telekinetic abilities. By simply staring at people, animals, plants, or objects, Hennako can manipulate them at will. The series depicts the chaotic daily lives of Hennako and those around her. This includes her very ordinary parents, her provocative older sister, and a former stray dog the family has taken in. Hennako's supernatural talents constantly throw their lives into disarray, exposing secrets and prompting all sorts of frenzied situations. With its quirky lead character endowed with reality-bending powers, Hennako-chan promises a surreal, satirical, and thoroughly entertaining experience for mature readers.",
