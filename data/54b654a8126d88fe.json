    "text": "Three years have elapsed since the catastrophic event of Hiroshima's bombing, and young Gen, now a fourth-grader, continues to navigate through the remnants of a devastated city. Alongside his adopted brother Ryuta, Gen forms a bond with a resilient group of orphans, including a girl with visible radiation scars, as they strive to create a semblance of family amidst the desolation.\n\nIn a city still grappling with the aftermath of the bomb, Gen and his newfound companions face constant hardships, with Gen's mother slowly succumbing to radiation sickness. When a powerful typhoon ravages the orphans' shelter, Gen takes the lead in constructing a new home on an abandoned plot, offering hope and solace to the scarred child.\n\nAs Gen endeavors to uphold his father's values and support his ailing mother, the stark reality of their situation remains ever-present. Surrounded by the grim consequences of the bombing, Gen and his makeshift family persist in their struggle for survival and search for a place in this challenging new world.",
