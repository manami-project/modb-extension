  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Education, friendship, and a touch of romance intertwine in the halls of Hakureiryou Academy, a once prestigious school for the affluent that now houses a unique Servant Education program. Enter Hino Akiharu, an orphaned high school student with a heart of gold but an appearance that screams \"delinquent.\" Despite his tough exterior, Akiharu is determined to make a life for himself and enrolls in the academy on a scholarship, eager to become a skilled butler.\n\nLife at Hakureiryou is far from easy for Akiharu. His intimidating looks make it difficult to connect with his mostly female classmates, and the rigorous Servant-Ed curriculum proves to be a formidable challenge. To make matters worse, an awkward encounter with the school's most esteemed student, Selenia Iori Flameheart, sets the stage for a series of comedic misunderstandings and mishaps.\n\nBut amidst the chaos, Akiharu finds solace in the company of his childhood friend, Tomomi, who brings a touch of familiarity to his otherwise hectic life. As he navigates the treacherous waters of clique wars and strives to make a name for himself, Akiharu must learn to balance his studies, friendships, and the occasional run-in with the enigmatic Selenia. With determination and a dash of humor, he embarks on a journey to find his place in the world and prove that there's more to him than meets the eye.",
