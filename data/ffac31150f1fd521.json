  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a dystopian near-future Japan, crime has skyrocketed, leading the government to legalize firearms for citizens. To combat this wave of violence, an elite police force called the Recently Armed Police of Tokyo (RAPT) was formed. Kyohei Tachibana dreams of becoming a pastry chef in France, but lacks the funds. When four female mercenaries - Jo, Meg, Sei, and Amy - hire Kyohei as their cook, he sees it as an opportunity to make money. However, he soon realizes the women take on dangerous jobs fighting criminals and syndicates in the seedy underbelly of Tokyo. Though initially hesitant to be part of this violent world, Kyohei decides helping the mercenaries is his only path to achieving his culinary dreams. As the women blast their way through assignments with their cybot Django, Kyohei witnesses the grim realities of their work. Yet he also sees their courage and loyalty to each other. While struggling to understand the women's motivations, Kyohei continues cooking for them, descending further into Tokyo's bloody crime world.",
