  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyohei Tachibana, a talented culinary student with dreams of becoming a pastry chef in France, finds himself entangled in a world of crime and violence in a dystopian future Japan where carrying firearms is legal. To save up for his dream, he accepts a part-time job as a cook for a mysterious group of women - Jo, Meg, Sei, and Amy. Unbeknownst to him, these women are not just your average citizens but a band of ruthless mercenaries, known as Burst Angel, who take on the most brutal jobs in the chaotic city of Tokyo. As Kyohei gets drawn deeper into their world, he realizes he's in for more than just cooking.\n\nIn this crime-infested future, Tokyo is ruled by syndicates and trigger-happy individuals, leading to the creation of the Recently Armed Police of Tokyo (RAPT) to maintain order. However, an underground rebellion is brewing against this oppressive regime, and the Burst Angel team finds themselves in the thick of it. With their fearless attitude and formidable skills, they take on any enemy that crosses their path, including rogue cybots and mutated humans. Joined by Django, a powerful cybot, the team stops at nothing to achieve their mission, living by the motto 'shoot first, talk later'.",
