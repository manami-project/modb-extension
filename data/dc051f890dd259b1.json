  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the escapades of Sawako Machida, affectionately known as 'Miss Bernard', a self-proclaimed literary enthusiast with a peculiar twist - she rarely reads the books she so passionately discusses! Nestled within the confines of her school library, Miss Bernard engages in lively debates about renowned literary masterpieces such as the Bible, The Tale of the Heike, Guns, Germs, and Steel, The Door into Summer, The Great Passage, and even Fermat's Last Theorem, despite not having read them cover to cover.\n\nSurrounded by her book-loving friends, Miss Bernard's literary journey is filled with humorous exchanges, shared experiences, and a mutual love for books. As she navigates through her literary adventures, Miss Bernard inadvertently gains knowledge and forges new friendships, all while maintaining her unique approach to the world of literature. This delightful gag series celebrates the joy of reading and the unique quirks that come with being a book lover.",
