  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set during the twilight of the Tokugawa era in 1866 Japan, \"Haguregumo\" is a comedic slice-of-life anime focusing on the Cloud family. The lazy and carefree protagonist, Kumosuke Haguregumo, is a retired samurai turned town fool who spends his days drinking, smoking, and chasing women, seldom returning home before dawn. At home waits his dutiful wife, Turtle, who puts up with his antics, and their two children - 11-year-old son Shinnosuke and 8-year-old tomboy daughter Ohana (nicknamed Flower). Shinnosuke and Ohana's responsible personalities contrast sharply with their father's laziness causing friction within the family. As Japan undergoes turbulent changes moving into a new modern era, Shinnosuke attempts to live an honorable life despite struggling to determine what honor means. Meanwhile, Kumosuke continues his carefree lifestyle, indifferent to the world around him even as other warriors strive to find their place. With its hilarious depictions of the Clouds' dysfunctional family dynamic and Kumosuke's comedic stubborn lazy personality, \"Haguregumo\" promises to entertain viewers during a fascinating transitional period in Japanese history.",
