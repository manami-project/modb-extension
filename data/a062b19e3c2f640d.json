    "text": "Hiroyasu Ishida's heartwarming debut work, \"Hinata no Aoshigure,\" introduces us to Hinata, a reserved fourth-grader with a talent for drawing and a heart full of love for his classmate, Shigure. As they bond over taking care of their school's aviary, Hinata's feelings for Shigure grow stronger, but his shyness keeps him from expressing them. Instead, he pours his emotions into his sketches and vivid daydreams.\n\nWhen the inevitable news arrives that Shigure's family is moving away, Hinata realizes he must act before it's too late. On the day of the move, he musters up the courage to chase after the train carrying Shigure, determined to finally confess his feelings. Will Hinata be able to share his love with Shigure before they're separated? Join this endearing duo in a delightful tale of young love, friendship, and the power of self-expression.",
