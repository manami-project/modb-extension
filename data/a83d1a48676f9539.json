    "text": "Freelancer Touno Kouhei, office worker Hamada Saori, and graphic designer Ginji find themselves unfulfilled in their current careers and yearn for something more. As part of Sakura Internet's 20th anniversary celebration, a special one-episode anime follows these three individuals as they embark on a journey of self-discovery and pursue their true passions. Kouhei, a musician at heart, struggles to make ends meet with various odd jobs. Ginji, who once dreamed of working in entertainment, finds himself designing tools for corporations and losing his enthusiasm for his work. And Saori, who settled for an administrative position at a stationary company after graduating from university, feels like a cog in a machine. Together, they must face the challenges and changes that come with chasing their dreams. Will they have the courage to break free from their current paths and follow their hearts? Only time will tell in this inspiring tale of self-discovery and determination.",
