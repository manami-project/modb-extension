    "text": "School is in session like never before at the worst institution in Kanto, where delinquent students rule the roost and teachers, mostly ex-convicts, have their own graveyard. Enter Ganpachi Chabane, a mysterious figure with a shadowy past who vows to bring order to this chaotic world. But Hinako Shiratori, the stunning and formidable leader of the school's most notorious gang, won't let him do so without a fight. With her secret weapon - her \"Lucky Kitty\" underwear - she takes on the ultimate teacher in a battle that will determine the fate of the school. Little do they know, Ganpachi's true identity as a former test subject of a bio-research lab accident may give him the edge he needs to succeed. Get ready for a wild ride as these two forces collide in an epic showdown that will leave you on the edge of your seat!",
