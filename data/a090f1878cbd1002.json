Led by an idealistic teenager named Quon, these Attractors band together to defend themselves against this threat.

When two Attractors named Tei and Towa are captured by Kestos, Quon spearheads a daring rescue mission by infiltrating the organization's headquarters using stolen blueprints. However, facing extreme danger awaits them inside. United by Quon's determined leadership and their shared status as Attractors, this unlikely group fights to protect their kind from sinister forces that seek to exploit their powers.
