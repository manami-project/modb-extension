  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime commercial features Rei Ayanami from Neon Genesis Evangelion as a spokesperson for KATE Tokyo's cosmetics line. Specifically, Rei is advertising KATE's 2-toned cream lipstick palette called Red Nude Rouge. As Rei gets ready to meet someone special, she applies the lipstick and declares \"no more rules,\" indicating this lipstick helps her break out of her typically quiet and reserved nature. There are two versions of the commercial showing Rei before and after applying the lipstick. Overall, this creative collaboration uses the iconic Rei Ayanami to promote KATE Tokyo's new lipstick line in an empowering way that encourages fans to express themselves through makeup. The commercial suggests the lipstick can give even someone as introverted as Rei a captivating boldness.",
