    "text": "Now here Island, the enigmatic landmass that emerges from the mists every half-century, has returned, bringing with it a new wave of terror. The island is under the tyrannical rule of the Four War Gods, who seek to harness its mystical powers. Amidst this chaos, Ai, a young half-demon, manages to escape and seeks the help of Inuyasha, a legendary half-demon warrior. Inuyasha, who had left the island five decades ago, must now confront not only the Four War Gods but also the ghosts of his past. As the island's mysterious powers begin to awaken, Inuyasha and his allies, including his half-brother Sesshoumaru, must find a way to defeat the Four War Gods and save the remaining half-demon children before the island disappears again into the mists. The battle against time and formidable enemies promises to be Inuyasha's most challenging adventure yet. Will he be able to liberate the island and uncover its secrets? Only time will tell.",
