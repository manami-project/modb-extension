  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Muranushi Sayuri serves coffee to an invisible customer, Kondou Kisaki manipulates her way out of work, and Kamakura Shiho throws money at problems - just another day at the Wagnaria family restaurant where Daisuke Higashida finds himself employed. As a first-year high school student, Daisuke had hoped to focus on his studies, but his father's bankruptcy forces him to take on a part-time job to support his family. With a cast of eccentric coworkers, including a floor chief who bullies the manager and a chef who never leaves the kitchen, Daisuke's new job is anything but ordinary. Based on the popular manga series, this anime follows Daisuke as he navigates the unpredictable world of the Wagnaria family restaurant.",
