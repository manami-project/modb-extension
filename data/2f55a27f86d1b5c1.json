  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Daisuke Higashida is a diligent first-year high school student living in Hokkaido. However, when his father's company goes bankrupt, Daisuke's family faces financial difficulties. No longer able to afford his phone bill, train pass, or even basic allowance, Daisuke decides to get an after-school job at the nearby Wagnaria family restaurant to support his irresponsible parents and younger sister. On his first day, Daisuke quickly realizes the staff at Wagnaria is far from normal. His floor chief Hana ruthlessly bullies the hapless manager Ken'ichirou while putting on a sweet facade for customers. The sly part-timer Kisaki manipulates Ken'ichirou into giving her preferential shifts. Even the seemingly friendly kitchen staff and servers have their quirks, from seeing ghosts to solving problems by literally throwing money at them. As an earnest student forced into work by his family's troubles, Daisuke stands out among the oddballs of Wagnaria. But with his living expenses on the line, he has no choice but to adapt to the restaurant's offbeat culture. Balancing his studies and job at this bizarre workplace full of misfits will undoubtedly be a strange coming-of-age experience for the young Daisuke.",
