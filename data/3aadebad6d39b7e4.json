  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Led by the indomitable Lady Integra Wingates Hellsing, the Hellsing Organization stands as England's covert line of defense against the undead. Founded on the principles of the Anglican community and named after the legendary Abraham Van Helsing, the organization boasts an army and a few secret weapons, the most formidable of which is the enigmatic vampire, Alucard. Despite his aversion to serving the Hellsing family, Alucard revels in his role as their vampire exterminator. When a young police officer, Seras Victoria, is caught in the crossfire and left mortally wounded, Alucard offers her a choice: die as a human or live as a vampire. Choosing the latter, Seras joins the Hellsing Organization, struggling with her new identity while learning to navigate the escalating conflict between humans and the supernatural. As the vampire activity surges, Integra, Alucard, and Seras must confront a threat unlike any they've faced before.",
