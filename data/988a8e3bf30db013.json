    "text": "Mister Satan's newly constructed hotel, a tribute to the triumph over the formidable Majin Boo, sets the stage for a grand celebration. Goku and his fellow warriors are invited to partake in the festivities, but their joyous gathering is interrupted by the unexpected arrival of a mysterious pod from space. Inside, a Saiyan named Tarble, bearing a striking resemblance to Vegeta, seeks aid against two menacing alien brothers, Abo and Kado, who have pursued him to Earth.\n\nIn a twist of fate, the responsibility of confronting these powerful adversaries falls not on the seasoned warriors, but on the young shoulders of Trunks and Goten. Despite being children, these two are eager to prove their mettle in battle. As the impending conflict threatens to disrupt the peace and potentially damage Mister Satan's grand hotel, the stakes are high, and the outcome uncertain. Will the young warriors rise to the challenge, or will they be overwhelmed by the might of these ruthless invaders? Only time will tell in this thrilling new chapter of the beloved anime series.",
