    "text": "Eclair, a world once on the brink of destruction due to relentless wars among humans, beastmen, and demons, was saved by a hero from another world. This hero, Setsu, achieved the unthinkable by bringing peace across racial lines, only to be ensnared in a 'trap' set by the human king who feared his growing power. Forcibly returned to his original world, Setsu was reborn as a baby, retaining all his memories and powers.\n\nFast forward to his high school years, Setsu, now a slightly gloomy teenager, is unexpectedly 'resummoned' to Eclair. The world he once saved is on the brink of war again, and five years have passed since his forced departure. Now, Setsu must navigate this familiar yet changed world, dealing with conspiracies and the impending war. Will he be able to save Eclair once more, or will the second time prove more challenging than the first? Join Setsu on this thrilling journey of second chances and unexpected adventures in a world he once called home.",
