  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Tobiichi Origami boldly asks Itsuka Shidou for a date, Shidou sees it as the perfect chance to end their relationship once and for all. Despite having the support of the Fraxinus crew and intentionally trying to sabotage the date, all of Shidou's attempts to deter Origami fall flat. In an unexpected turn of events, Origami remains unphased by his actions and continues to enjoy the date.\n\nMeanwhile, Yatogami Tooka receives a new cellphone from Kotori and spends time experimenting with it. Later, during a date with Shidou at the arcade, Tooka declines his offer to take a picture together. Instead, she opts to take a solo photo in a photo booth, giving the picture to Shidou as a special memento just for him.\n\nThis unaired 13th episode, bundled with the 9th volume of the original novel, presents a series of comedic twists and turns as Shidou navigates his complicated relationships with Origami and Tooka.",
