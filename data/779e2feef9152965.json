    "text": "After failing to secure a spot in college, Hideki Motosuwa relocates to the bustling city to prepare for his next entrance exams. In this futuristic metropolis, personal computers have evolved into humanoid 'Persocoms', becoming indispensable companions for many. Despite his financial constraints, Hideki dreams of owning one of these advanced machines. One fateful day, he stumbles upon a discarded Persocom in a desolate alleyway. Eagerly taking her home, he discovers that the Persocom can only utter a single word: 'Chii'. Deciding to name her after the only word she knows, Hideki soon realizes that Chii is unlike any other Persocom. Lacking an operating system and incapable of downloading information, Chii seems to be a unique, home-made model. As they spend more time together, Hideki begins to suspect that Chii might be a 'Chobit', a legendary type of Persocom rumored to possess human-like emotions and independent thought. In this world where humans and Persocoms coexist, can a bond deeper than friendship blossom between Hideki and Chii?",
