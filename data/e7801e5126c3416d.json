    "text": "The anime \"Namuamidabutsu! Utena\" unfolds a timeless battle between enlightenment and darkness, centering around the revered Shaka Nyorai and the malevolent entity, Mara. In a distant past, Shaka, a prince turned Buddhist deity, achieved enlightenment and brought peace to the world, conquering the suffering that plagues all living beings - the old, the sick, and the dying.\n\nHowever, in the present age of decay, Mara, the embodiment of worry and desire, seeks vengeance against Shaka for his past defeat. To accomplish this, Mara forms a sinister pact with the devil, manipulating humans by preying on their deepest worries.\n\nStanding against Mara is a formidable team led by Shaka, known as the Thirteen Buddhas, along with two benevolent deities, Taishakuten and Bonten. Together, they fight to protect humanity from Mara's manipulations and safeguard the hard-won peace. As the conflict between Mara and the Buddhist gods intensifies, the lives of countless individuals hang in the balance, making this a battle that no one can afford to ignore!",
