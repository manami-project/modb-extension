    "text": "Athanasia is a tragic princess destined to die at a young age by the orders of her cold and ruthless father, Emperor Claude, in the popular novel The Lovely Princess. However, an ordinary woman suddenly finds herself reborn as the infant Athanasia, retaining memories of the princess's doomed fate. Determined to change her destiny, Athanasia hastily crafts plans to survive within the imperial palace—either by avoiding attention, amassing enough wealth to escape, or charming her way into her father's graces. Her initial schemes fail as she crosses paths with Claude too soon. Now only five years old, she pivots to focus all her wit and charm on earning her father's affection before her looming execution date. But many factions lurk in the shadows of the palace, threatening Athanasia's delicate plans. Jennette longs for Claude’s approval as his illegitimate daughter while corrupt nobles vie for power behind the emperor's back. To survive, Athanasia must rewrite history and melt her father's icy heart before her fate catches up with her.",
