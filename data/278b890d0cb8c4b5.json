    "text": "Film synopsis: A solitary boy, isolated both at school and at home, stumbles upon an abandoned sandlot on his way home. Inspired, he envisions creating his own 'town' within the space. As he begins to sketch out his plans, another boy observes him from afar and begins to mimic his actions. This interaction marks the beginning of a complex relationship between the two boys, one that blurs the lines between imitation, admiration, and friendship. This animated short is a 2013 production from the Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation.",
