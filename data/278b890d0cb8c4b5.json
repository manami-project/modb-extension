  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A lonely boy struggles to connect with others, spending his days isolated at school and home. One day after school, he stumbles upon an empty sandlot and envisions creating his own special 'town' there. As he begins mapping out blueprints for the town on the walls, another boy wanders over and watches with curiosity. At first, the two boys clash, quarreling over the sandlot town. Yet perhaps this shared interest could spark an unlikely friendship between these two lonely souls. Through imagination and collaboration, the barren sandlot is transformed into a space for human connection. Though details remain unclear, this anime seems to explore themes of isolation, creativity, and the bridges built through simple acts of engagement with one another.",
