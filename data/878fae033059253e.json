    "text": "Fuyuki City is the setting for a long-held ritual called the Holy Grail War, which takes place every few decades. Seven masters are chosen and paired with seven heroic spirit servants, including Saber, Lancer, Archer, Rider, Caster, Assassin and Berserker. The master-servant pairs battle until only one remains, and that pair will be granted their greatest wish by the mythical Holy Grail. This story focuses on Rin Toosaka, a high school student who enters the latest Holy Grail War hoping to summon the powerful Saber servant. However, she miscalculates and ends up summoning the Archer servant instead. Despite this setback, Rin is determined to succeed her late father and win the war. Rin soon discovers that her classmate Shirou has gotten caught up in the Holy Grail War battles as well, and she unexpectedly saves his life when he is mortally wounded. With Archer at her side, Rin continues on her quest to obtain the Holy Grail in this action-packed supernatural contest.",
