    "text": "In the 23rd century, humanity's exploration of space leads them to uncover ruins of an ancient alien civilization on the planet Solo. There they discover powerful technology, including the massive mecha Ideon. However, their presence draws the hostile Buff Clan seeking the limitless energy source known as Ide. When the Buff Clan attacks and destroys the human settlement, some survivors escape on the newly discovered Solo Ship spacecraft. Among them are Cosmo Yuki, Kasha Imhof, and Bes Jordan, who become Ideon's pilots, as well as Karala Ajiba, daughter of the Buff Clan's leader. Hunted through space by the relentless Buff Clan, the human refugees struggle to unlock Ideon's true capabilities in order to protect themselves. Yet the mysteries of this rediscovered alien technology run deeper than any of them realize. Both sides seek to harness the legendary power of Ide without comprehending its terrifying scale or purpose.",
