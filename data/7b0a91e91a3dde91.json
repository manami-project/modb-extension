    "text": "Seeing the world through the eyes of Fuuka, an orphan with a fiery spirit, we embark on a journey of determination and self-discovery. Once inseparable from her childhood friend Rinne, their bond was shattered when Rinne was adopted into a wealthy family, leaving Fuuka behind to face the harsh realities of life. Fuuka's life takes a dramatic turn when she crosses paths with Einhart Stratos, a renowned martial arts champion, who saves her from a vicious gang attack. Recognizing Fuuka's innate potential, Einhart extends an offer to train her, reigniting her desire to confront Rinne in the ring. As Fuuka delves deeper into the world of martial arts, she must face her past, overcome her fears, and ultimately, redefine her future. With Einhart's guidance and the support of her newfound friends at Nakajima Gym, Fuuka's transformation from a struggling orphan to a formidable martial artist unfolds, as she sets her sights on the one person she longs to defeat - her estranged friend, Rinne.",
