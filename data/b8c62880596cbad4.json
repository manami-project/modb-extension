  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tensai Bakabon is a lighthearted comedy centered around the eccentric Bakabon family. The father is a self-proclaimed \"great philosopher\" who goes to absurd lengths seeking answers to bizarre questions, often dragging his family into his harebrained schemes. His genius son Bakabon joins in these misadventures, tricking his hapless father into humorous situations. Though eccentric, the Bakabons are a loving family. They find joy in life's simple pleasures - fishing in puddles, playing imaginary games. Their eccentricities and laugh-out-loud antics frequently perplex their neighbors, but the warmth of the Bakabon family always shines through in the end. With its charming characters and gentle, slapstick humor, Tensai Bakabon promises to bring smiles and laughter to viewers of all ages. This light comedy celebrates finding philosophy in unexpected places and finding connection through humor.",
