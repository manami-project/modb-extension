    "text": "Centuries ago, a colossal spider wreaked havoc on Tokyo until a legendary exorcist sealed it away, restoring peace. In present day Tokyo, Mizuki Henmi visits an old bookstore run by her acquaintance Shu Suzuri. There, Mizuki mishandles an antique book, accidentally breaking its seal and releasing a small spider entity. Initially seeming harmless, the spider, named Wasurenagumo, takes up residence with Shu and Mizuki. While Shu dotes on his new arachnid companion, Mizuki grows suspicious, questioning the spider's origins and intent. As the story unfolds, it's revealed that Wasurenagumo has a connection to the ancient spider that attacked Tokyo. Though initially presenting a cute and innocent facade, there are signs the spider may become dangerous. The bookseller and his assistant must unravel the mystery of this entity they've unleashed before calamity strikes Tokyo once more.",
