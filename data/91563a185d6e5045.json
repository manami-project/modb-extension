  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yashiro's fascination for the supernatural and her dreams of a romantic escapade lead her to the infamous third stall of the third floor girls' bathroom in the old school building of Kamome Academy. The bathroom is rumored to be the dwelling place of Hanako-san, one of the Seven Mysteries of the school, who is said to grant any wish upon being summoned. However, when Yashiro calls upon Hanako-san, she encounters a boy, contrary to the popular belief that Hanako-san is a girl. This unexpected turn of events entwines Yashiro's life with the supernatural world, as she becomes Hanako-kun's assistant. Together, they work to maintain the delicate balance between the mortal and spirit realms while trying to stay out of trouble themselves. Little did Yashiro know that her quest for love would lead her to a world beyond her wildest imagination.",
