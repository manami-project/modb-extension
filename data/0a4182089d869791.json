  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Life takes a dramatic turn for Takuto, a brilliant young scientist, when an unexpected tragedy befalls his already strained relationship with his research-focused girlfriend, Maki. While visiting Maki's research subject, Frank - a colossal metallic entity, a catastrophic building collapse occurs, claiming every life except Takuto's.\n\nFast forward to 2054, Earth finds itself in the throes of an unrelenting alien invasion. The United Nations responds by establishing an elite military unit called Funeral, specifically tasked with combating these extraterrestrial adversaries.\n\nMonths after the tragic incident, Takuto awakens in a hospital, harboring an insatiable thirst for vengeance against Frank. Seizing the opportunity, the enigmatic Dr. X presents Takuto with a new identity - Ryu Soma - and a chance to infiltrate Funeral and exact his revenge.\n\nAs Ryu Soma, Takuto finds himself at the forefront of Earth's defense against the alien onslaught, alongside Harriet Bartholomew, a 13-year-old girl with an inexplicable connection to the seemingly benevolent alien, EX-1 (aka Frank). With vengeance fueling his every move, Takuto embarks on a perilous journey to bring down Frank and unravel the mysteries surrounding the alien invasion.",
