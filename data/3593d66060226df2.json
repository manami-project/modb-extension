  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One young man, Akira Miyamoto, finds himself in a desperate race against time as he battles to save Japan from becoming a vampire-infested island in just 47 days. When his brother Atsushi goes missing, Akira's family is thrown into chaos, their business crumbles, and his father turns to alcohol. Constantly compared to his brother and nursing a secret crush on his friend Ken's girlfriend, Yuki, Akira's life takes a dramatic turn when he discovers an unconscious girl, Rei Aoyama, outside his home.\n\nRei reveals that Atsushi is alive but trapped on Higanjima Island, a place rumored to be overrun by vampires. Determined to save his brother, Akira invites his friends on a graduation getaway to the island, only to find themselves ambushed by vampires. Narrowly escaping with his friends, Akira reunites with Atsushi, who unveils the existence of Miyabi, the powerful vampire leader.\n\nAs the human race's final stand against the vampires unfolds, Akira and his friends, guided by Atsushi, prepare to face Miyabi and his vampire army in a series of 12 self-contained, stand-alone stories. Each episode of Higanjima X brings to life key scenes and dialogue from the manga, blending original elements to create a thrilling and suspenseful anime experience.",
