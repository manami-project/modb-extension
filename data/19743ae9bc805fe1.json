    "text": "Saku Ooyagi returns to his hometown to attend high school after being away for seven years. He runs into Mihoshi Akeno, a lively childhood friend who loved stargazing and astronomy. Their last interaction was Mihoshi falling out of a tree and Saku diving to save her. Though Saku hopes for a quiet school life, Mihoshi is determined to reconnect and forces him to join the astronomy club she founded. As club members, Saku, Mihoshi, and several classmates spend time together stargazing. Mihoshi's exuberance leads the club activities while Saku contributes his knowledge. Hime Makita, another girl from Saku’s past who wishes to pursue a relationship with him, also joins. Despite Saku’s initial reluctance, he settles into the club and friendships form. The experiences in the astronomy club lead Saku, Mihoshi and their diverse classmates to mature and reconsider their outlooks on life. Though different personalities initially clash, the members increasingly appreciate one another’s perspectives.",
