    "text": "If you're looking for a unique blend of humor, heart, and a dash of ecchi, then look no further than the story of Nagumi Koushi, a 12-year-old boy whose life takes a dramatic turn after his father abandons him following a house fire. Left to fend for himself, Koushi's luck changes when he's discovered by a lively young woman named Minerva. She offers him a new lease on life by inviting him to become the \"Dormitory Mother\" at a women's college dormitory known for its unruly residents.\n\nSurrounded by a cast of eccentric and vibrant older women, Koushi must navigate the challenges of maintaining order while dealing with their quirky personalities. From the androphobic yet gentle Atena Saotome to the reckless and science-obsessed Minerva herself, Koushi's new life is anything but ordinary.\n\nJoin Koushi as he embarks on this wild and slightly ecchi journey, filled with laughter, tears, and unforgettable moments. Will he succeed in taming the chaotic Goddess' Dormitory, or will the eccentric residents prove too much for him to handle? There's only one way to find out!",
