    "text": "Let yourself be drawn into a world marked by harshness and despair, where five young men, known as Homura, Uruu, Takara, Juka, and Ranmaru, serve at the enigmatic Bar F. Their mission is not merely to serve drinks, but to heal the wounded hearts of their patrons, erase their sorrows, and ignite a radiant smile within them. In exchange for this emotional transformation, they ask for only one thing: the hearts of those they aid.\n\nFairy Ranmaru: Anata no Kokoro Otasuke Shimasu follows the journey of these five extraordinary young men, who operate under the guise of high school students and a barkeeper to conceal their true identities as fairies from the most powerful clans. Their objective is to gather 'attachment' to preserve their own world, while assisting their clients in overcoming their hidden emotional turmoil.\n\nAs the fairies of Bar F navigate through the challenges presented by their diverse clientele, they encounter an enigmatic figure who seeks to spread chaos and sin. With their mission hanging in the balance, they must unveil this individual's identity and thwart their plans, all while staying true to their own hearts.",
