    "text": "This historical anime unfolds during the serene Edo period, in the sixth year of the Kan'ei era. Lord Tokugawa Tadanaga organizes a tournament that breaks the existing dueling laws by allowing the use of real swords, a stark contrast to the traditional wooden swords. The tournament brings together two formidable swordsmen with a shared past and a bitter rivalry: the one-armed Fujiki Gennosuke and the blind Irako Seigen. Both disciples of Japan's greatest swordsman, Iwamoto Kogan, they are determined to prove themselves as the true successor of his school. As they engage in a brutal and bloody battle, their intertwined past is revealed, filled with conflict and a twisted sense of destiny. The scars on their bodies and souls are a testament to their violent history, leading to a final showdown that will determine the ultimate champion.",
