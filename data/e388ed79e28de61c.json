  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Humanity faces an existential threat from demonic creatures called Oni that emerge to attack without warning. With no way to fight back, scientist Dr. Saotome develops a series of giant robots powered by the mysterious Getter Rays, granting them the strength to combat the Oni. However, only the ultimate robot, Getter Robo, has the power to defeat the Oni for good. Getter Robo is uniquely able to reconfigure itself into different forms to handle any situation. But it requires three pilots to unlock its full potential. Dr. Saotome recruits hotheaded martial artist Ryoma Nagare, calculating criminal leader Hayato Jin, and hulking monk Benkei Musashibou to form an unlikely team. With the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, these disparate personalities must find a way to work together as the Getter Team to uncover the truth about the Oni and save the world from their endless onslaught.",
