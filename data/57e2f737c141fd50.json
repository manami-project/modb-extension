  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ordinal Scale, an Augmented Reality MMORPG, has taken the world by storm in 2026, two years after the Sword Art Online incident. Unlike its predecessors, NerveGear and Amusphere, Ordinal Scale utilizes a wearable device called Augma, which allows players to remain conscious while playing. Developed to compete against full-dive systems, Augma's user-friendly and safe design has made it an instant hit.\n\nKirito's friends, including Asuna, have already dived into the game, but Kirito is hesitant to join. Eventually, he gives in to the craze and starts playing. However, all is not as it seems in Ordinal Scale. As Kirito and his friends progress through the game, they discover that strange and dangerous events are occurring. What initially seemed like just fun and games now poses a new threat, and the group must face this challenge head-on.",
