  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nankoflank Dungeon, a legendary location in the virtual multiplayer online role-playing game 'The World,' has reopened after a two-year hiatus, promising rare items and treasure to those who dare to venture inside. The dungeon, notorious for its powerful healing monsters, requires players to defeat enemies in a single strike, making it a challenging quest for even the most experienced gamers.\n\nMimiru, a seasoned player, teams up with Bear to participate in an event held in the dungeon. However, unlike other players, Mimiru's motivation isn't the promise of treasure or experience points. Instead, she seeks to recapture the memories and experiences of her early days in the game.\n\nAs they navigate through the dungeon, Mimiru and Bear cross paths with a character named Mimika. Together, the trio embarks on a series of quests and events, offering Mimiru a deeper understanding of the game's true meaning. This special OVA episode serves as a bonus storyline following the events of '.hack//SIGN,' providing a nostalgic journey for Mimiru and an engaging adventure for viewers.",
