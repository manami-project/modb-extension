    "text": "And so begins the escapades of Yamada, a stunningly beautiful first-year high school student with an unconventional ambition: to share intimate moments with 100 partners before graduation. But there's a catch - Yamada is a virgin, and her self-consciousness about her own body and lack of experience make her quest more challenging.\n\nEnter Takashi Kosuda, an unassuming, camera-loving classmate who, as fate would have it, is also a virgin. Yamada sees him as the perfect starting point for her journey, believing that his inexperience will make him less judgmental. However, seduction isn't as easy as it seems, and Yamada's raging hormones and rival suitors don't make things any simpler.\n\nAs Yamada embarks on her mission to win Kosuda's heart and more, she discovers that there's more to relationships than just the physical aspect. Will Yamada succeed in her seduction, or will she find that there's more to love than she initially thought? Join Yamada and Kosuda in this hilarious and heartwarming tale of self-discovery, friendship, and first loves.",
