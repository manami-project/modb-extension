    "text": "Electronics from behind the scenes. Amidst this political turmoil, Banagher Links, an ordinary 16-year-old student residing in the manufacturing colony Industrial 7, finds himself entangled in a web of secrets and conflicts that transcend his peaceful life. His chance encounter with a mysterious girl, Audrey Burne, who is on a mission to prevent a war, sets him on a path towards the enigmatic Laplace's Box.\n\nLaplace's Box, a forbidden object shrouded in mystery, is said to possess the power to shape the course of the universe. The Vist Foundation, a puppeteer manipulating world events, intends to hand over this secret to the Sleeves, remnants of the Neo Zeon faction. The exchange is set to take place at Industrial 7, unbeknownst to Banagher, who is unwittingly drawn into this grand conflict by his own bloodline.\n\nAs the white mobile suit Unicorn Gundam undergoes repeated tests and becomes the subject of diverse speculations, Banagher must navigate the complexities of war and uncover the secrets of Laplace's Box. With the hundred-year curse of the Universal Century on the brink of resolution, Banagher's life is forever changed as he steps into the cockpit of the Unicorn Gundam to defend his friends and protect the fate of humankind.",
