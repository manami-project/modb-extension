  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Spain, Ethiopia, and the devastated Hiroshima serve as the backdrop for an extraordinary journey undertaken by two unsuspecting junior high school students, Mii and Yuko. During a school trip to the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, the pair stumbles upon a monument dedicated to Dr. Marcel Junod, a name unfamiliar to them. Suddenly, they find themselves enveloped in a mysterious light and transported back to 1935, embarking on a path that mirrors the life of the young Dr. Junod.\n\nAs a delegate of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Dr. Junod is dispatched to Ethiopia, where he witnesses the horrors of war firsthand. The young doctor is confronted with the atrocities of poison gas attacks and the targeting of Red Cross workers, but he remains steadfast in his mission to alleviate the suffering of those affected by the conflict.\n\nThroughout World War II, Dr. Junod's humanitarian efforts extend from the battlefields of Europe to the devastated city of Hiroshima, where he becomes the first foreign doctor to provide aid following the atomic bombing. His unwavering dedication to improving the conditions of prisoners of war, facilitating prisoner exchanges, and establishing communication channels between prisoners and their families earns him recognition and gratitude.\n\nAs Mii and Yuko traverse the tumultuous path of Dr. Junod, they bear witness to his indomitable spirit and the profound impact of his work. This journey of self-discovery prompts the young girls to reflect on their own lives and challenges, ultimately inspiring them to embrace the values of compassion and resilience embodied by the remarkable Dr. Junod.",
