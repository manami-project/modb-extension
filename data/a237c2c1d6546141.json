    "text": "Japanese trainer Ichiro Ogami arrives in Paris in 1926 to assemble a unique, all-female team called the Paris Assault Force, based in a secret nightclub, Les Chattes Noires. Erika Fontaine, a cheerful yet clumsy girl with strong spiritual powers, is the first member. Soon, she's joined by four other spiritually gifted girls, each with diverse backgrounds: a nun, a thief, a noble, and a circus performer. Together, they pilot steam-powered mechanical suits to protect Paris from monsters. Despite their differences and personal challenges, can they unite as a team and defend their beloved city against the looming darkness? The Paris Floral Assault Division is ready to face the enemy and safeguard their city.",
