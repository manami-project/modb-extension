    "text": "In 1926 Paris, an unseen evil presence lurks in the city's streets, threatening to unleash destruction. The fate of the City of Love rests on five young women who possess spiritual powers - Erika, a cheerful girl with clumsy nature, Charlotte, an aristocrat, Juri, a thief, Erica, a nun in training, and Oise, a girl mourning a loss. Though originally strangers, they are brought together as the \"Paris Assault Force\" - a secret, all-female team operating out of the Les Chattes Noires nightclub. Donning steam-powered suits, they must put aside their differences and bond as a team. Together, they have the spiritual abilities to defend Paris and its people from the monsters spawned by the evil presence. Despite their wildly diverse backgrounds, these five heroines share a dedication to protecting their beloved city. Can this unlikely team of gifted women come together and unlock the full potential of their powers to defeat the supernatural threat before Paris is lost forever?",
