  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nekoma High School's volleyball team recruits an exceptionally tall but inexperienced new member named Lev Haiba. Though Lev proclaims himself the ace, his poor ball control frustrates setter Kenma Kozume during practice. At their coach's urging, Kenma reluctantly agrees to personally train Lev. Initially overwhelmed by Lev's clumsy spikes and blocks, Kenma slowly realizes his potential value as an offensive weapon given proper technique. Their extra practice pays off when Lev is allowed to play in a practice match versus a powerhouse school. Faced with this high pressure opportunity, Lev must prove he can utilize his height advantage effectively and evolve into the ace he envisions himself to become. Through hard work and persistence, this mismatched pair shows the beginnings of a promising partnership.",
