    "text": "One fateful night, a strange phenomenon occurs across the nine provinces, setting in motion events that will change the fate of one young disciple. Five years after that incident, Chu Feng awakens a mystical lightning beast and discovers a sealed egg within himself, marking him with an unknown power. As an unremarkable outer disciple of the Azure Dragon School, Chu Feng begins walking the path of cultivation, determined to unravel the mysteries of that night. With each revelation, his might grows, soon awakening the attention of powerful enemies. Yet the young disciple remains firm in his dedication, ascending through the ranks with both courage and cunning. Along the way, he accumulates steadfast comrades, fearsome spirits, and astonishing skills to overcome all who stand in his way. In time, Chu Feng's legend spreads far and wide, known to all as Asura, the one who defied heaven's will to become a Martial God. But to Chu Feng, enlightenment was always the goal, to honor those who believed in him from the beginning and to protect the world that fate chose him to save.",
