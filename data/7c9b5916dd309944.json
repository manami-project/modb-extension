Inspired, he embarks on his own volleyball journey, aspiring to reach similar heights despite his short stature. Enrolling in the same school as his idol, Hinata is eager to join the volleyball team, but is met with an unexpected obstacle - Tobio Kageyama, a prodigious setter and former middle school rival.\n\nTheir tense history and ongoing rivalry lead the Karasuno team to deny their entry into the club, insisting they learn to cooperate. Determined to play, Hinata and Kageyama return with a plan to demonstrate their newfound teamwork. As they form an unlikely duo, an old rival school extends an invitation for practice matches, rekindling the competitive spirit between the two schools.\n\nThis retelling of the first season of the TV anime Haikyuu!!, complete with never-before-seen story material, follows Hinata and Kageyama as they strive to overcome their differences and work together to lead Karasuno High School to a national championship.",
