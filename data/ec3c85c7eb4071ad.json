  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mihoshi and Kiyone are on high alert as they join Washuu and Sasami in a galaxy-wide search for their missing friend, Tenchi. Back on Earth, Ryoko and Ayeka, despite their usual rivalry, team up in the hopes of finding him. After months of relentless searching, they finally pick up Tenchi's signal in Tokyo. However, the Tenchi they find is not the same boy they once knew. He appears older, and more shockingly, he seems to have no memory of his past life or his friends. Instead, he is living with a mysterious woman named Haruna. As Ryoko and Ayeka grapple with this new reality, they must unravel the enigma of Haruna's connection to Tenchi's grandfather, Yosho. Will they be able to rescue Tenchi from this parallel world and restore his memories, or will they lose him forever to this strange new life? The answers lie in the heart of a battle that will be fought not with weapons, but with love.",
