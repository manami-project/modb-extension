    "text": "Kurumi's and Baku's escape from the dungeon of Mary Land, armed with the magical Melody Bow, spells chaos in the human world as they manipulate dreams into nightmares to amass dark power. My Melody, a magical being from the same realm, is dispatched to the human world to thwart their evil plans and safeguard people's dreams.\n\nArriving in Yumegaoka City, Kuromi entices the citizens with false promises of wish fulfillment, only to twist their dreams into nightmares with the Melody Key. Meanwhile, My Melody finds an ally in Yumeno Uta, a junior high school student who shares her passion for music. When Uta's violin is cursed with evil magic, My Melody intervenes, leading to a blossoming friendship and partnership.\n\nTogether, My Melody and Uta face various challenges orchestrated by Kuromi, resolving them with the help of Melody Tact, a magical instrument. However, as the nightmares escalate, Uta's loved ones and even those close to her secret crush, Hiiragi, fall victim to Kuromi's schemes. The stakes have never been higher as My Melody and Uta strive to protect the dreams of those around them and put an end to Kuromi's reign of terror.",
