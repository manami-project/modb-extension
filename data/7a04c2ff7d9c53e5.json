    "text": "For Oz Vessalius, a privileged 15-year-old heir to the esteemed Vessalius household, the Abyss is merely a chilling bedtime story meant to keep unruly children in line. But his world of opulence and comfort is shattered when his coming-of-age ceremony is disrupted by the sinister Baskerville Clan, who cast him into the Abyss, a treacherous realm teeming with grotesque creatures called Chains.\n\nIn the depths of the Abyss, Oz encounters Alice, a mysterious Chain known as the Bloodstained Black Rabbit. Together, they forge a contract and escape the Abyss, only to find themselves entangled with the clandestine organization, Pandora. As Oz embarks on a journey to unravel the enigma surrounding Alice, the Abyss, and the prophecy that led to his banishment, he begins to question the true meaning of his existence.\n\nBased on the supernatural manga of the same name, Pandora Hearts follows Oz's thrilling adventure as he navigates through a world of dark secrets and hidden truths, challenging the boundaries of his reality and uncovering the mysteries that lie within the Abyss.",
