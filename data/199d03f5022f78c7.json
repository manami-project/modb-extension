  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Contains 27 episodes, including 23 animated shorts that aired on TV Asahi Network's 'Bokusho Mondai Boss Chara Ou' and 4 unbroadcast episodes, this anime is based on the comics by the late Nekojiru. The story follows the lives of Nyako, a carefree cat girl, and her younger brother Nyatta, who are both selfish and inconsiderate, causing chaos and destruction in their daily lives. With a total disregard for the lives of others, these kittens can't even perform simple tasks without causing harm to innocent bystanders. The family dynamics are further complicated by their alcoholic father and abusive mother. Despite being upright cartoon animals with human-like feelings and thoughts, they still eat and kill each other without remorse. Nyako and Nyatta lead the audience through these often brutal, yet light-hearted scenes.",
