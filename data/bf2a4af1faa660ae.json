  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Osaka-based aspiring manga artist Nishi has harbored feelings for his childhood friend Myon since they were nine. Now 20, Nishi's love for Myon remains unchanged, but his cowardice has prevented their relationship from blossoming beyond friendship. Upon reuniting, Myon reveals her impending marriage, but invites Nishi to her family's restaurant. There, they encounter two yakuza seeking Myon's father to settle a debt. As the situation escalates, one of the yakuza threatens Myon, and Nishi, fueled by newfound courage, attempts to intervene, only to be shot and killed.\n\nIn the afterlife, Nishi's unyielding desire to live propels him back to Earth, moments before his demise. Seizing the opportunity, he outsmarts his killer, and escapes with Myon and her sister. The trio finds themselves pursued by the yakuza, but their fate takes a surreal turn when they end up inside a whale's belly. There, they meet an old man yearning for human companionship, and together, they forge a temporary life filled with love, camaraderie, and dreams of returning to the world above.\n\nDirector Masaaki Yuasa's Mind Game presents a captivating tale of love, courage, and living life to the fullest, with a unique visual style that complements its extraordinary narrative.",
