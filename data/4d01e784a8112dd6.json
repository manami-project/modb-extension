    "text": "Kazuko and Taichi, an anime production assistant with a childhood dream of becoming a hero, are part of a groundbreaking initiative in a not-so-distant future Japan. As the country grapples with escalating public security concerns, the government introduces a new system that empowers select civilians to aid in apprehending criminals within specific zones. This novel approach gives rise to the Deliver Police, of which Taichi is a proud member.\n\nIn this world of advanced transportation, conventional law enforcement faces limitations in maintaining public safety. The Deliver Police, with Taichi and Kazuko at the helm, strive to fill this gap and restore order. As they navigate their designated territory, they must race against time to capture the villains wreaking havoc.\n\nThis thrilling tale is one of four short films showcased at Animenotane 2021, offering a unique blend of action, suspense, and a dash of anime production insights. Will Taichi and Kazuko's heroic efforts be enough to curb the rising tide of crime and make their city safe once more? Only time will tell.",
