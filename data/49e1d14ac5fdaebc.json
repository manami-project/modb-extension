  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Colonel Takashiro Yooichi leads a formidable defense unit in the year 1999, as Earth is besieged by the Idelians, a nomadic alien race whose colossal colony-spaceship is on the brink of depleting its energy reserves. The Idelians seek refuge in our solar system, leading to a sudden invasion in the Alps. The Earth Defense Forces are outmatched by the invaders' advanced powered armor, except for one specialized unit comprised of three courageous soldiers and their transformable robots.\n\nMasato Mugen, Pierre Bonaparte, and Louie Oberon are the skilled human pilots who command their respective variable mecha, each designed for all-terrain combat. These machines, capable of transforming into robots, include a jeep, a tank, and a helicopter. As the Triple Command, they valiantly resist the Idelian onslaught, engaging in fierce battles to protect their home planet. This international trio forms Earth's last line of defense against the alien threat, offering a glimmer of hope in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.",
