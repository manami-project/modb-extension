    "text": "Half way through his mundane life, Takemichi Hanagaki, a downtrodden freelancer, is jolted by the tragic news of his middle school sweetheart, Hinata Tachibana's, brutal murder at the hands of the infamous Tokyo Manji Gang. As he stands on the edge of despair, quite literally on a train platform, he is inexplicably thrust back in time by twelve years. Seizing this unexpected opportunity, Takemichi embarks on a mission to rewrite his bleak past and save Hinata from her grim destiny. To achieve this, he must rise through the ranks of the very gang responsible for her death, aiming for the top of Kanto's most notorious delinquent faction. As Takemichi navigates the complexities of his past, he realizes that he has the power to change not only Hinata's fate but also his own.",
