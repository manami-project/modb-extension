    "text": "Fudanshi Koukou Seikatsu follows the daily life of Ryou Sakaguchi, a seemingly ordinary high school student with an extraordinary hobby. Sakaguchi is a fudanshi, a term coined for men who have a deep passion for boys' love (BL) stories. Despite being surrounded by classmates who don't share his enthusiasm, Sakaguchi remains steadfast in his love for the genre. His world takes a turn when he encounters Rumi Nishihara, a closeted fujoshi who shares his interest in BL stories. Along with Yuujirou Shiratori, an openly gay cooking club leader, Akira Ueda, Shiratori's devoted admirer, and Daigo, a popular BL doujinshi author, Sakaguchi finds himself in a diverse group of individuals who embrace their unique interests. As they navigate the chaotic world of otaku culture, Sakaguchi's best friend, Toshiaki Nakamura, can only hope for a return to normalcy. This hilarious slice-of-life comedy explores the joys and challenges of being a fudanshi in a world that doesn't always understand.",
