  "synopsis": {
    "text": "At the ripe age of 25, Rentt Faina has spent a decade battling monsters, but his lackluster skills confine him to a life of slaying slimes and goblins for a paltry sum. His mundane existence takes a dramatic turn when he stumbles upon an unexplored path in the Labyrinth of the Moon's Reflection. Instead of finding treasure, Rentt encounters a legendary dragon that promptly devours him. Awakening as a pile of bones, Rentt finds himself undead but undeterred. Equipped with his trusted sword, tool belt, and eerie new appearance, Rentt embarks on a quest for Existential Evolution, hoping to regain a human form and rejoin society. Will Rentt's journey through the labyrinth lead to redemption, or will he remain trapped in his undead state forever? Join Rentt as he battles monsters and seeks a new lease on life in this thrilling anime adventure.",
