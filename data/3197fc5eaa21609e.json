  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mikagura High School is known for its prestigious cultural clubs and cute school uniforms, which draw in transfer student Eruna Ichinomiya. However, Eruna soon discovers an intense club battle system, where representatives from each club possess unique powers and compete against one another. These battles determine club rankings, which decide club member privileges. As club participation is mandatory, Eruna joins the going-home club, led by the popular Mikagura Seisa. Here she befriends fellow members but must also assist them in competing for the top spot against drama, manga, and calligraphy clubs. Through her adventures across quirky school clubs and supernatural battles, Eruna strives to find her place in school while uncovering the troubled lives of new friends. With high-energy action and a slice-of-life coming-of-age journey, Mikagura High School takes an imaginative look into school club politics and after-hours drama. Eruna tries to make the most of her high school experience while caught up in the ultimate attacks of competing cultural clubs.",
