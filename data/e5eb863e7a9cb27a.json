However, an unexpected power surge caused by time-traveling terrorists led to a short circuit, leaving Doraemon in a heap of industrial waste. Luckily, Noramyaako, a charming robotic feline, swooped in to save him, sparking an instant connection between the two. Despite his production mishap, Doraemon was sent to a special class for unique robots, where he reunited with Noramyaako. This heartwarming tale serves as a prequel to the beloved series, offering a glimpse into Doraemon's early days, his first love, and his eventual decision to journey back in time to assist the Nobi family.",
