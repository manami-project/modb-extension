  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Time had worn away the memories of a fleeting encounter, but the heart held on to a promise etched in the form of a feather. As a young boy, he stumbled upon an unfamiliar path in his hometown, leading him to a chance meeting with a captivating girl during a sudden downpour. The shelter they shared sparked an immediate affection, and when the rain ceased, he carried with him a featherâ€”a token of their reunion. Despite his efforts, the mysterious path eluded him the next day, and as the years passed, the girl slipped from his mind. Half a century later, the now-grown man returns to his roots, only to find himself dreaming of the girl he once loved. Guided by the very feather he's cherished, he sets out to rediscover the love that time couldn't erase. This timeless tale is brought to life by the masterful hand of Yoshitaka Amano, serving as its writer, illustrator, and director.",
