    "text": "Welcoming weary travelers and noblemen alike, Izakaya Nobu is a hidden gem tucked away in the ancient city of Aitheria. With its unassuming exterior, one might never guess that this humble establishment serves up the finest alcohol and dishes from another world. Master chef Nobuyuki Yazawa and his trusty server, Shinobu Senke, work tirelessly to provide their patrons with an unforgettable dining experience. From lazy palace guards to incognito clergymen, the diverse clientele of Nobu all share one thing in common: a love for the exquisite cuisine and warm atmosphere that only Nobu can provide. As the doors open and the aroma of delicious food fills the air, patrons can't help but call out, \"Give me a cold ale, master!\" and leave their troubles at the door.",
