    "text": "The story follows Futaro, a tutor hired by five sisters who initially struggled with their studies. Over time, Futaro helps the Nakano quintuplets significantly improve their grades and work towards achieving their dreams. As their final school festival approaches, marking the end of their time together, deeper feelings have grown between Futaro and the sisters after their bonds strengthened from tutoring sessions. The sisters start to see Futaro as more than just a tutor while he promises to sort out his own feelings by the festival's end. With graduation nearing, the Nakano quintuplets try capturing Futaro's heart, hoping for a future together. Yet deciding who he has feelings for proves difficult for the conflicted Futaro. As the last school festival arrives, will love blossom between Futaro and one of the sisters he's guided over the years? Or will they go their separate ways after this final high school memory?",
