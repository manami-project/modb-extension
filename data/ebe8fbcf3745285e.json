    "text": "Futaro Uesugi, a dedicated tutor, has successfully guided his five students, the Nakano quintuplets, towards the end of their high school journey. Initially reluctant learners, the girls have not only improved academically but also developed a deep bond with their tutor. As their final school festival approaches, the air is thick with unspoken feelings and potential romantic connections. The quintuplets, each with their own dreams and aspirations, find themselves vying for Futaro's affection. With the promise to reveal his true feelings by the end of the festival, Futaro faces a challenging decision. Will this academic journey culminate in a romantic union between Futaro and one of the Nakano sisters? Only time will tell.",
