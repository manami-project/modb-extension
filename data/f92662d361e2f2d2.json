  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sena is a shy, small-statured high school student who has become adept at running away from bullies. After the cunning Hiruma, captain of the school's fledgling American football team the Deimon Devil Bats, witnesses Sena's impressive speed, he coerces Sena into joining the team as a secret weapon running back. To conceal Sena's identity from rival teams, Hiruma makes him wear an eyeshield helmet with a dark visor and the number 21, dubbing him \"Eyeshield 21.\" Though initially lacking confidence, Sena gains self-assurance from his experiences on the Devil Bats, who hope to go from underdogs to championship contenders with Eyeshield 21's lightning-quick speed leading the charge. Along the way, Sena forms strong bonds with his teammates as they strive to make their way to the Christmas Bowl, Japan's premier high school football tournament.",
