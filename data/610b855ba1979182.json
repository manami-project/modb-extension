  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Demon King Echidna, once a formidable threat to humanity, is now struggling to rebuild her once-mighty army after her defeat at the hands of Leo, the world's strongest hero. In a twist of fate, Leo, who was once hailed as a savior, finds himself shunned by the very people he protected due to his overwhelming power. With no place left to turn, Leo seeks employment in the very army he vanquished, hoping to find purpose and acceptance.\n\nAs the demon army grapples with financial difficulties, staffing shortages, and a mountain of work, Leo takes it upon himself to utilize his immense strength to turn the situation around. Along the way, he crosses paths with Echidna once more, and a burning question resurfaces in his mind: why did she invade the human world in the first place? The answer he receives is far from what he expected, challenging everything he thought he knew about the war and his role in it.\n\nFilled with unexpected alliances, personal growth, and a quest for understanding, this anime delves into the complexities of heroism and the consequences of power, as Leo navigates his new life among the very enemies he once fought.",
