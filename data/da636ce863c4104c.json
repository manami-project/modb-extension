  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As we step into the near future, a new era of coexistence unfolds, with nearly one in ten individuals being humanoids - highly advanced, sentient robotic beings. These humanoids, while seamlessly integrated into society, grapple with their own unique health challenges, much like their human counterparts. Enter Dr. Hikaru Sudou, a compassionate and dedicated physician specializing in humanoid healthcare.\n\nIn a world where the lines between artificial and organic life blur, Dr. Sudou navigates the complex ethical landscape of treating his unconventional patients, even resorting to clandestine methods when necessary. As he delves deeper into the enigmatic world of humanoid ailments, he encounters a diverse range of cases, from a humanoid grappling with her identity to a robotic teddy bear carrying the memories of multiple owners.\n\nWhile the technological advancements continue to pose intricate questions about the essence of humanity and the definition of self, Dr. Sudou remains steadfast in his mission. His journey is not one of war or violence, but of love, friendship, and the relentless pursuit of understanding in a rapidly evolving world. As he treats his patients, he constantly challenges societal norms and redefines the boundaries of empathy, compassion, and acceptance.",
