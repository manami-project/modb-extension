  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unable to shake off the guilt, a young student finds himself in a moral dilemma as he repeatedly witnesses the relentless bullying of his classmate, Don-chan, at the hands of Yaragase and his gang. Despite the teacher's discussions on bullying, the timid bystanders remain silent, fearing they might become the next victims. As the torment escalates, the young student grapples with the question of whether he should intervene or continue to mind his own business. This thought-provoking anime, funded by the '2011 Young Animator Training Project', invites viewers to reflect on the consequences of inaction and the importance of standing up for others.",
