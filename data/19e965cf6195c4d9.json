  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Saiki Kusuo is your typical high school student, or so it seems. Beneath the surface, he harbors a plethora of psychic abilities, including telepathy and telekinesis, that often prove to be more of a burden than a gift. Craving the simplicity of an ordinary life, Kusuo strives to keep his extraordinary talents hidden from his peers. However, his attempts to maintain a low profile are thwarted by the eccentric characters that are inexplicably drawn to him, such as the dim-witted Riki Nendou and the delusional Shun Kaidou. As Kusuo grapples with the chaos that surrounds him, he discovers that the mundane existence he yearns for is much harder to attain than he initially thought. Initially aired as a series of short episodes, this anime offers a unique blend of humor and supernatural elements, providing a fresh perspective on the life of a reluctant psychic.",
