    "text": "Meanwhile, in a parallel universe, the essence of human souls transforms into books upon death, revealing their deepest secrets and past experiences. The Bantorra Library serves as the sanctuary for these books, safeguarded by the elite Armed Librarians who possess extraordinary psychic abilities. However, the religious sect known as the Shindeki Church poses a significant threat, as they convert individuals into living weapons called 'Meat' with the sole objective of eliminating Hamyuts Meseta, the Armed Librarians' leader. Amidst the looming danger of Dragon Pneumonia, the Librarians must utilize their unique powers to thwart the Church's sinister schemes, especially when one of their own betrays them and seizes a legendary war machine. In this battle of psychic prowess and determination, will the Armed Librarians be able to protect the invaluable books and the world itself from the clutches of the Shindeki Church? The final chapter remains unwritten.",
