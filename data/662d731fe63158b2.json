    "text": "Cammy's Delta Red team navigates the Amazon jungle, investigating a mysterious force that has ravaged the landscape. Meanwhile, Guile and Chun Li are on a mission to uncover the truth behind the sudden disappearance of powerful fighters from around the world. As they delve deeper into their respective investigations, all eyes turn to the elusive and legendary fighter, Ryu.\n\nRyu, a master of his combat discipline, is struggling to control the power of the Dark Hadou that threatens to consume him. Unbeknownst to him, a secret agent is hot on his trail, determined to track him down at any cost. As the world's greatest fighters begin to vanish, it becomes clear that a new evil is on the rise, and those who fought against Shadaloo must once again take up arms.\n\nSet after the events of Street Fighter II, this animated prequel to the video game Street Fighter IV follows Ryu and his allies as they uncover a sinister plot to kidnap powerful fighters and use them to create deadly biological weapons. With Cammy walking through the woods with her troops, Sakura and Chun-Li fighting against a gang of thugs, and Crimson Viper facing off against Ryu, the stakes have never been higher. Will Ryu be able to control his dark side and save the day, or will the world succumb to this new threat? Only time will tell.",
