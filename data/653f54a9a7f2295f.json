  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Can a rookie detective crack the case and provide an alibi for a man accused of murder? That's the premise of this anime, which follows middle school student Shinichi as he investigates the death of a man's grandmother. The man, Kouichi Akimoto, claims he was asleep in the park at the time of the killing, but he needs someone to confirm his story. Shinichi takes on the challenge, determined to prove Kouichi's innocence and find the real culprit. Along the way, he encounters various obstacles and dead ends, but he refuses to give up. Will he be able to solve the case and clear Kouichi's name?\n\nThis anime is part of the Magic File series, which includes promotional OVAs released to commemorate the beginning of each Meitantei Conan film. The OVAs often feature side stories related to the film, such as backstory on the characters or events. In addition to the OVA, each Magic File release includes a second disc with unaired PPV episodes of the series. The first disc of Magic File 2 contains the Movie 12 Side-Story OVA, which focuses on Shinichi and his investigation into Kouichi's case. The second disc contains previously released PPV episodes. Magic File 2 was sold at select retailers in Japan, including 7-11 branded equivalents.",
