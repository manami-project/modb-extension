    "text": "News flash from the countryside! In the quaint village of Tokio, the fourth-graders at the local school possess peculiar superpowers that are more amusing than menacing, like flying eyeballs and missile-hair. Among these gifted youngsters is Ippei and his pals, who are determined to become top-notch ninjas. However, their journey to mastery is fraught with challenges, as they constantly face off against the obnoxious cheaters from the neighboring Techno village. This anime offers a delightful blend of ninja action and school-life humor, all adapted from Kawai Kazuyoshi's beloved children's manga. Brace yourself for a unique and entertaining experience!
