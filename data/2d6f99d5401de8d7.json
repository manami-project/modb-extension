  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an alternate vision of modern-day Germany, the country finds itself besieged by an outbreak of demonic creatures called Amalgams. Arising mysteriously from dead bodies, these biomechanical beasts exhibit a vicious compulsion for violence and destruction. Their ability to fuse with technology grants them deadly new abilities and makes them nearly unstoppable. To combat this threat, the government forms an elite military unit called the Xenogenesis Assault Team (XAT). However, even the highly-skilled XAT struggles to contain the unrelenting Amalgam attacks. The situation worsens with the emergence of a new threat - Amalgams created from living humans instead of corpses. Unlike the mindless normal Amalgams, these human variants retain their intelligence and free will. Among these awakened Amalgams are the determined Gerd Frentzen and the enigmatic Joseph Jobson. Nicknamed \"Blassreiter,\" Jobson demonstrates unrivaled strength and mastery over his powers. However, the secret behind his abilities remains shrouded in mystery. With mankind teetering on the brink, these Amalgam outliers emerge as central figures in the fight for humanity's future. Will their efforts be enough to turn the tides against the Amalgam scourge? Or is doomsday inevitable?",
