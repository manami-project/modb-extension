  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nakajima Atsushi, an orphan kicked out of his orphanage, rescues a suicidal man named Dazai Osamu while starving by a river. Dazai and his partner Kunikida are members of the Armed Detective Agency, which solves supernatural cases too dangerous for the police. They are tracking down a man-eating tiger connected to Atsushi. Later, the Guild organization enters the city to take it over and capture Atsushi. With the Port Mafia also vying for control, a three-way war looms. Amidst the fighting, Atsushi and his rival Akutagawa find allies in unexpected places, while Dazai continues his scheming. In the past, Dazai was an executive in the Port Mafia alongside the low-ranking Sakunosuke Oda and intelligence agent Ango Sakaguchi, who gathered as friends at a bar. One night, Ango disappeared, leaving only a photo of the three. Now in the Armed Detective Agency, Dazai faces threats from the Port Mafia and the American Guild aiming to steal his group's work permit.",
