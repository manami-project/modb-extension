    "text": "Asano Shinichiro, a high school student down on his luck, finds himself in need of a job to keep a roof over his head. Following his teacher's advice, he takes up a housekeeping job for the Shimazu family, where he encounters the beautiful yet brash Sakuya. Unbeknownst to him, Sakuya is the 37th head of the Shimazu family, a lineage responsible for exorcising and eliminating unwanted creatures. When Shinichiro inadvertently releases one of these captured entities, the duo must join forces to recapture it. Along the way, Shinichiro discovers his own latent abilities in 'true names' and 'true eyes,' drawing him further into Sakuya's supernatural battles. Amidst the chaos, Shinichiro's knack for cooking and cleaning makes him an invaluable asset to the Shimazu family, leading to unexpected adventures filled with comedy and creature hunting.",
