    "text": "April 6th, 2020 marked the return of the feisty demoness Jashin-chan and her gothic summoner, Yurine Hanazono, in the second season of \"Jashin-chan Dropkick.\" Stuck in the human realm due to an incomplete summoning spell, Jashin-chan finds herself reminiscing about the day she first met Yurine. Desperate to return home, Jashin-chan vows to eliminate Yurine, her earthly tether, and scribbles her name in her 'Death NOT.' However, this is no easy task, as Yurine possesses formidable strength and frequently subjects Jashin-chan to gruesome, albeit regenerative, punishments.\n\nAs the power struggle continues, an unexpected visitor arrives: Pino, a former subordinate of Pekola and Poporon. Pekola, elated, assumes Pino is a divine envoy sent to guide her home. But the situation grows tense as Pino brandishes a weapon, leaving everyone on edge. Catch the thrilling chaos of their cohabitation, filled with violent slapstick comedy and unexpected twists, exclusively on Amazon Prime Video Japan and Crunchyroll.",
