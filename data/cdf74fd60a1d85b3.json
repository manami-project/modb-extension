  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Niwaka Samurai, a legendary assassin for hire, is said to roam the seedy underbelly of Fukuoka, a city that appears peaceful on the surface but is plagued by crime and corruption. The Hakata district is a breeding ground for professional killers, detectives, informants, and revenge seekers, among other unsavory characters. Zenji Banba, a perceptive and laid-back detective, finds himself investigating the activities of various hitmen organizations in the area. However, when he crosses paths with Xianming Lin, a disgruntled crossdressing hitman who works for one of these organizations, an unlikely partnership is formed. Lin, who is tired of being underpaid and undervalued, is tasked with eliminating Banba but instead offers him a chance to join forces. As they navigate the dangerous world of organized crime, they uncover a dark conspiracy involving the corrupt mayor and the Kakyuu Group. With the Niwaka Samurai on their tail, Banba and Lin must work together to survive and bring justice to the city of Fukuoka. Will they be able to put an end to the rising crime rate, or will they become the next victims of the killer of professional killers? Only time will tell.",
