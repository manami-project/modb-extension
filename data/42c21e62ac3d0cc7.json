    "text": "One young boy's life is forever altered when his pursuit of fame and recognition as a DJ leads him to a mysterious world hidden from reality. Yukiya Araki, a 14-year-old with a deep love for house music, spends his days creating and uploading music videos online, hoping to one day become a renowned DJ. However, his life takes a dramatic turn when he decides to film a music video in the enigmatic Ziggurat, a place that exists beyond our reality. In doing so, he inadvertently attracts the attention of powerful duos known as Hand Shakers, who possess the ability to summon weapons called Nimrodes from their psyche. As a result, Yukiya finds himself embroiled in a series of battles, a fate his adoptive father, a former Hand Shaker himself, had hoped to shield him from.",
