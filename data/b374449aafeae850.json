    "text": "Yuuya Tenjou is a high school student who has faced mistreatment and adversity throughout his life. Bullied at school and neglected by his parents, his only source of affection was from his grandfather. When his grandfather suddenly passes away, Yuuya inherits his home. Upon exploring the house, Yuuya discovers a mysterious door that transports him to a magical parallel world. In this new fantastical realm, Yuuya gains extraordinary abilities, weapons, and game-like stats and skills. After leveling up and becoming nearly invincible in the magical world, Yuuya returns to Earth through the door in his house. Back in the real world, Yuuya finds his appearance changed and that he now possesses superhuman talents. Empowered by the treasures and blessings bestowed upon him in the other world, Yuuya now has the potential to reach new heights and transform his once difficult life. As he adjusts to his newfound gifts, his life heads toward an exciting and uncharted future.",
