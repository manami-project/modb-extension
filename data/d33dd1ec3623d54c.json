    "text": "Saotome Ranma is a teenage martial artist who, during a training journey with his father Genma, fell into a cursed spring that causes him to transform into a girl when splashed with cold water. Seeking a cure, Genma takes Ranma to meet his old friend Tendou Soun, who agrees to let Ranma marry one of his three daughters in order to carry on the family's martial arts school. Ranma is reluctantly paired with Tendou Akane, Soun's short-tempered but kindhearted youngest daughter. Though initially adverse to each other, Ranma and Akane slowly warm up despite the chaos that ensues from Ranma's continuing search for a cure, Akane's many aggressive suitors, and the introduction of other characters cursed at Jusenkyo Springs. This includes Shampoo, a Chinese Amazon girl who turns into a cat and is bound by her laws to kill girl Ranma and marry boy Ranma. There's also Mousse, a hidden weapons master who competes with Ranma for Shampoo's affection despite being no match for him. Through many misadventures, the ever-growing cast come to accept the craziness that has invaded their lives while Ranma and Akane's relationship deepens. But the chaos has only just begun.",
