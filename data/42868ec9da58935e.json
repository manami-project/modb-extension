    "text": "Eternal servitude to the victor - that's the high stakes duel challenge Ikki Kurogane, the so-called 'Worst One' at Hagun Academy, faces from Stella Vermillion, the foreign princess and top-ranked Blazer. In a world where magic knights wield weapons forged from their souls, Ikki's magical abilities are almost non-existent, earning him the title of the worst student at the academy. But when Stella transfers to Hagun, their fateful encounter sets the stage for a duel that could redefine societal norms. Will the Worst One rise to the challenge or succumb to the Crimson Princess? Join Ikki and Stella in their thrilling journey of magical growth, unexpected friendships, and life-altering consequences.",
