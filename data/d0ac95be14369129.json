  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime episode revolves around Tomoki, a character with a penchant for perverted schemes, and Nymph, an angeloid in search of a new master. The setting is an indoor water park, owned by the enigmatic Mikako Satsukitane, where the gang decides to spend the day. Tomoki, true to his nature, uses this opportunity to execute another one of his questionable plans. Meanwhile, Nymph grapples with the void left by her previous, sadistic master. Feeling a twinge of jealousy towards Ikaros, who has Tomoki, Nymph embarks on a quest to find a new master. This particular episode, filled with chaos and comedic moments, was deemed too risqu√© for television broadcast.",
