  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kenzaburou Tondabayashi, a 52-year-old Japanese civil servant, finds himself in a peculiar situation after a car accident. He wakes up reincarnated as Grace Auvergne, a duke's daughter, in a world strikingly similar to an otome game his daughter used to play. The twist? Grace is the game's villainess, a role Kenzaburou struggles to embrace due to his disciplined and kind demeanor.\n\nDespite his best efforts to maintain the original game's narrative, Kenzaburou's calm and respectful aura, honed from years in the workforce and his family-oriented values, earns him the admiration of the heroine and the student body. As he navigates this new world, Kenzaburou must rely on his past experiences and impeccable manners to fit in with the younger crowd. However, remembering the foreign names and staying true to the villainess role proves more challenging than he anticipated.\n\nIn this unique blend of reality and fantasy, Kenzaburou embarks on a journey to balance his new identity as Grace Auvergne while ensuring the happy endings of the characters around him remain intact. Will he succeed in his mission, or will his kind-hearted nature steer the story off course? Only time will tell.",
