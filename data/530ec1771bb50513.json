    "text": "Kenzaburou Tondabayashi is a 52-year-old Japanese government worker who gets into a car accident and finds himself reborn as Grace Auvergne, the villainess of an otome game that his daughter used to play. Now living as a haughty noble girl in a fictional European country, the disciplined older man struggles to act according to his new role. Despite attempts to play the part of the arrogant villainess, Kenzaburou's kind aura leads him to befriend the story's heroine and earn the admiration of the student body with his elegant demeanor. Drawing on his life experience and family-oriented values, he tries to keep the story on track while fitting in with his younger peers. Though playing the villain is harder than expected, Kenzaburou is determined to avoid interfering with the happy endings of those around him.",
