Their primary activity involves indulging in delicious snacks and engaging in casual conversations. However, their laid-back lifestyle is threatened when the popular student council presidential candidate, Satsuki Shinonome, proposes the disbandment of clubs with no significant contributions to the school.\n\nDetermined to protect their cherished club, the Food Research Club members approach the current student council president, Yakumo Mōri, for guidance. Following his advice, Yūki decides to run for the presidency, challenging Satsuki's stance on club abolishment. As the election looms, Yūki and his friends must rally support to safeguard their club and preserve their snack-filled sanctuary. Can they rise to the challenge and secure victory, or will their beloved Food Research Club crumble under the weight of political change?",
