  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers on special two-person teams called \"Patraisers,\" consisting of a \"Sugar\" and their \"Patron\" supporter. The purpose of the Patraisers is to reinvigorate frozen hearts. The main story focuses on one particular Patraiser pair: Sugar Asahi Yuga, played by Masaya Imamura, and his Patron Ryouya Nekoyashiki, played by Masato Toyoshima. Their bond allows them to merge into a single Patraiser hero. The side stories provide a glimpse into the daily lives of Asahi and Ryouya, as well as the experiences of the other Patraiser teams. Over time, we see how the Patraisers use their powers to unlock frozen hearts and make emotional connections. Though the Patraisers all share the same overarching goal, each pair has their own style and approach. By exploring multiple perspectives, the anime highlights the diverse ways people can lift each other up. At its core, this is a story about understanding, acceptance, and the ties that bind us together.",
