    "text": "Masato Toyoshima and Masaya Imamura star as the central Patraiser duo in this anime, featuring unique hero pair teams known as 'Patraisers.' Each Patraiser team comprises a 'Sugar' and their 'Patron,' who work together to rejuvenate the hearts of those who have become emotionally frozen. The main storyline follows the Sugar Asahi Yuga and his Patron Ryouya Nekoyashiki as they embark on their mission to restore warmth to people's hearts. Complementing the main story are side stories that offer a glimpse into the daily lives of the Patraiser teams and other characters, adding depth and charm to the overall narrative. This anime is presented in two formats: a 41-episode series of 7-minute shorts and a combined 11-episode series with 26-minute episodes, each containing four parts of the original.",
