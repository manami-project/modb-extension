However, their idyllic vacation takes a sinister turn as a threatening figure from their past reappears, intent on disrupting their hard-earned peace. Shintaro and the Raimu Unit must once again take up arms to defend themselves, all while dealing with furtive romantic advances from the girls. Their mettle tested in both war and love, the Amanohara crew face their enemy head-on, willing to fight to maintain the bonds they have forged.",
