  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Algaroc, the envious God of Wind, once sowed discord between Oceanus, the God of Water, and Hyperia, the Goddess of Fire, leading to a seemingly eternal conflict between their respective followers. However, the heirs to these divine lineages, Prince Sirius of the Sea Kingdom and Princess Malta of the Fire Kingdom, unexpectedly cross paths and find themselves inexplicably drawn to one another. As they struggle to keep their forbidden love hidden, they must contend with the weight of their parents' age-old prejudices and the question of whether their love can bridge the divide that has separated their people for generations. Can Sirius and Malta's love triumph over the deep-seated enmity between the Children of Fire and Water, or will they ultimately be forced to accept a future where they must remain forever apart?",
