    "text": "Botanâ€™s lifelong aspiration of sharing a tea party with angelic beings seems within reach when she and her childhood friend, Shinobu, join the prestigious St. Asmaria All-Girls School. Their ordinary lives take a peculiar turn with the sudden appearance of an eccentric angel named Un. After an unexpected mishap, Un offers her halo as a snack to Botan, resulting in a bizarre side effect: Botan must regularly \"give birth\" to vibrant, mushroom-like objects. Un reveals that Botan's dream could come true if she manages to lay one hundred thousand of these \"eggs.\" With this newfound purpose, Botan embarks on a chaotic and unpredictable journey at her school filled with angelic girls.",
