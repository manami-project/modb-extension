  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zeusâ€™s divine realm, a tiered hierarchy of angels, was established eons ago to maintain harmony among the animals of Earth. The Supreme Deity appointed six Saint Beasts, guardians of immense power, to protect the mortal world. Among them were Go, Shin, Rei, Guy, Yuda, and Ruka, each governing a unique dominion. However, two angels, Kira and Maya, descended to Earth, shunning their celestial duties.\n\nAs time passed, Zeus's oppressive rule sowed seeds of discord among the once-loyal angels. Meanwhile, the human world faced a growing threat from the dark pit, a prison for fallen angels. During the Holy Spirit Festival, banished souls escaped, casting a sinister shadow over the heavens. The Saint Beasts, now caught in a battle against their own kin, vowed to thwart the insidious plans of these vengeful spirits.\n\nAmong the escaped fallen angels were Kirin no Judas and Houou no Luca, who sought retribution against Zeus by destroying heaven and creating a paradise in hell. As the world teetered on the brink of chaos, the four holy beasts were summoned to investigate the mysterious disappearance of guardian angels. With the fate of the heavens and Earth hanging in the balance, the Saint Beasts prepared to face their greatest challenge yet.",
