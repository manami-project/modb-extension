  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japan was once a formidable force due to the powerful Onmyoudou magic, but a catastrophic event caused by Yakou Tsuchimikado led to its downfall. In the aftermath, the Onmyou Agency was formed to manage spiritual disasters and combat demons. Fast forward to the present, and Onmyoudou magic has evolved and become more accessible, but not everyone can wield it. Harutora, born into the prestigious Tsuchimikado family, is one such person. Despite his inability to use magic, Harutora made a childhood promise to protect Natsume, the heir to the Tsuchimikado family and Yakou's supposed reincarnation. When a member of the Onmyou Agency attempts to recreate the experiment that led to Japan's downfall, Harutora must decide whether to keep his promise and fight by Natsume's side as her familiar or continue living a normal life. With danger looming, Harutora's destiny is set in motion as he embarks on a journey to protect Natsume and prevent another disaster.",
