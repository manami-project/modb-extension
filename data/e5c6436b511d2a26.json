  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kageyama Torako, an irresistible force of nature, and her quiet best friend, Saotome Suzume, cross paths with two lost freshmen, the shy Ayumi Nonomura and the taciturn Tatsuki Iizuka, on the sprawling campus of Kamizono Academy. Torako takes the lead, sometimes gently guiding and other times firmly pushing, as the girls and their classmates navigate the trials and tribulations of high school, home life, and adolescence. Alongside their eclectic group of classmates, including a last-minute Morals Officer named Nene and Kageyama's robot-building endeavors, they find friendship, excitement, and a shared determination to conquer the monotony of everyday life at Kamizono Academy.",
