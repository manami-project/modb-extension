    "text": "In the spring of 1998, 15-year-old Kouichi Sakakibara transfers into class 3-3 at Yomiyama North Middle School. He soon notices his new classmates behaving strangely and sensing a fearful atmosphere hanging over them. 26 years prior, a popular student named Misaki from class 3-3 suddenly passed away. Since then, a gloomy curse is believed to loom over all subsequent third-year classes. Students and teachers seem to pretend a ghost student named Misaki still exists. Kouichi is drawn to Mei Misaki, a quiet, eye-patch wearing girl whom his classmates oddly pretend does not exist. Despite warnings from classmates and Mei herself, Kouichi reaches out to Mei in an attempt to unravel the sinister truth behind the fearful atmosphere. As Kouichi and Mei investigate the mysterious curse of class 3-3, their classmates are plunged into a series of tragic and inevitable deaths. Solving the curse may reveal the unsettling secrets behind the class but will come at a terrible price.",
