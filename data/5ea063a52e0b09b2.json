    "text": "Yoru and Ran, two halves of a passionate love story, reside within the hearts of Hashiba Sora and Fujimori Sunao, two young men bound by a shared past. When Sora experiences a devastating fall that erases his memories, he finds himself navigating a complex web of relationships and hidden truths. As he struggles to regain his lost memories, Sora must confront the enigmatic alternate personalities that emerge when night falls.\n\nSunao, Sora's new roommate and supposed childhood friend, is eager to reconnect with his forgotten companion. But Sora's memory loss has left him with a blank slate, and Sunao's insistence that they were once close only adds to his confusion. As they share a room in their boarding house, guided by their mutual friend Honjo Matsuri, the two boys must navigate their tangled past and the mysterious bond that connects them.\n\nAs Sora's memories slowly resurface, he uncovers shocking secrets about his youth and the origins of Yoru and Ran. Despite their initial discomfort with their alter egos' nocturnal activities, Sora and Sunao find themselves inexplicably drawn to each other. Can they unravel the mysteries of their past and embrace their feelings, or will the shadows of yesterday threaten to tear them apart?
