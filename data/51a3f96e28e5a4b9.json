  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Natsuki Enomoto is a high school student who has romantic feelings for her childhood friend, Yu Setoguchi. However, Natsuki struggles to properly confess her love to Yu. When she finally works up the courage, she becomes overwhelmed by embarrassment in the critical moment and claims she was just \"practicing\" her love confession on Yu. Oblivious to Natsuki's true intentions, Yu promises to support her as she continues \"practicing.\" Meanwhile, Natsuki's classmate Koyuki Ayase asks her out on a date. Natsuki now finds herself hiding her feelings for Yu while potentially embarking on a new romance with Koyuki. As Natsuki deals with her failed confession attempt and Koyuki's date offer, the story follows the sweet and bitter trials surrounding young romance. Natsuki dreams of one day genuinely confessing her love to Yu instead of just \"practicing,\" but must find the courage within herself to speak from the heart. Will Natsuki finally admit her true feelings, or will her continued \"practices\" jeopardize her chances with both Yu and Koyuki?",
