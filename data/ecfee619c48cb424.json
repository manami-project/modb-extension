    "text": "Nanakaâ€™s life takes an unexpected turn when a fall down the stairs leaves her with the mindset of a six-year-old. As a 17-year-old high school student, Nanaka was once a serious and goal-oriented individual, often criticizing her childhood friend, Nenji, for his delinquent behavior. Now, with her memory lost and her mind reverted, Nanaka must navigate through life with the help of Nenji and her father, who strive to keep her condition a secret. As Nanaka's classmates, including an honor student and Nenji's rivals, become entangled in her life, the challenge to maintain a normal school life becomes increasingly complex. Will Nanaka and Nenji be able to keep up the facade, or will their secret be revealed? Join Nanaka as she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth, all while believing she is a magical princess in a world full of surprises.",
