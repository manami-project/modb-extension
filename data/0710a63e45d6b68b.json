    "text": "In the holy city of Mecca, a humble potter named Aws lives a simple life with his wife. But when a ruthless general named Abraha leads a massive army to invade the city, Aws is compelled to take up arms to defend his home. Though the people of Mecca are peaceful and the city has no formal defenses, Aws and a small band of men stand resolute to protect their families, their city, and the sacred Kaaba sanctuary from destruction. They know the battle ahead will be all but impossible to win against the imposing enemy forces. Among the defenders is Aws's old friend Zurara, an atheist mercenary who unexpectedly returns to fight for Mecca after being inspired by Aws' powerful faith. Despite impossible odds, Aws hopes that by uniting with brave men like Zurara their love for Mecca will give them the strength to prevail. With the enemy attack imminent, Aws confronts his own doubts and turbulent past in order to lead the courageous defense of the holy city.",
