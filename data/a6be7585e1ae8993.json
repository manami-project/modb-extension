    "text": "Oreki Houtarou, a high school student with a penchant for energy conservation, finds his tranquil life disrupted when his older sister coerces him into joining the Classic Literature Club to prevent its disbandment. In the club, he encounters three distinct individuals: Chitanda Eru, a beautiful and inquisitive girl with an insatiable curiosity; Fukube Satoshi, a cheerful boy with an exceptional memory who refers to himself as a database; and Ibara Mayaka, a petite, strict girl who harbors feelings for Fukube.\n\nAs they delve into the club's activities, they stumble upon a mystery that took place 45 years ago, involving a female member's uncle. The clues to this enigma are hidden within an old anthology of works by the club's former members, titled 'Hyouka'. Despite his initial reluctance, Houtarou, driven by Chitanda's relentless curiosity, finds himself entangled in a series of intriguing mysteries that range from a self-locking classroom door to the club's own shadowy history.\n\nJoin Houtarou and his friends as they navigate through these puzzling cases, challenging Houtarou's energy-saving lifestyle and piquing the interest of the ever-curious Chitanda. Will they uncover the truth buried within the dusty pages of 'Hyouka'? Only time will tell in this engaging and suspenseful anime.",
