    "text": "Li Changshou is a young man struggling with an incurable illness who finds himself reborn in ancient times before a pivotal battle that will determine the new gods. Now a cultivator in a cruel, prehistoric world, Li realizes that keeping a low profile offers his best chance at survival and the immortality he seeks. Avoiding conflicts and dangerous situations, Li quietly focuses on honing his mystical abilities, mastering escape techniques and pill refinement in the seclusion of the mountains. However, Li's peaceful cultivation is disrupted when his master unexpectedly brings home a new female junior disciple. Forced out of isolation, Li soon becomes embroiled in a series of adventures that will transform his understanding of lifeâ€™s value and purpose. Though typically calm and measured in his actions, when compelled Li wields astonishing power against evil enemies. Yet he also finds camaraderie with like-minded friends. With new bonds forged and old beliefs challenged, this accidental cultivator in antiquity will shape the fate of the coming Fengshen War and his own future.",
