  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Moz, the mightiest warrior of Treasure Island, stumbles upon Senkuu's hidden laboratory while pursuing Amaryllis, who was sent to inform Senkuu of a failed mission. Kohaku and Ginrou, members of the Kingdom of Science, had attempted to infiltrate the harem of the Petrification Kingdom's leader, but their mistake exposed their true intentions to Minister Ibara and Moz. However, Moz's ambitions do not align with Ibara's, as he desires to overthrow the minister and claim the petrification device for himself. If Senkuu, the scientific genius and son of astronaut Byakuya, can outwit Moz, he may gain a formidable ally and secure victory in the impending war against the Petrification Kingdom.\n\nMeanwhile, Senkuu and his companions have successfully produced nitric acid and discovered platinum, enabling them to revive their petrified friends. Ryuusui, the first person to be freed from petrification twice, is among those rescued. With the rest of the crew soon to be revived, the stage is set for a showdown between the Science Kingdom and the Petrification Kingdom.",
