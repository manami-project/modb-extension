    "text": "It's crunch time for the Urusei Yatsura saga! A new suitor, Lupa, enters the scene, triggering a high-stakes game of tag between Lum, Ataru, and the fate of Earth itself. To triumph, Ataru must utter three simple words he's consistently avoided saying to Lum: 'I love you.' Will Ataru confess his true feelings and secure Earth's safety, or will his stubborn pride lead to its downfall?\n\nMeanwhile, an old agreement made by Lum's grandfather comes to light, promising Lum's hand in marriage to a wandering merchant. Misunderstandings and heated arguments arise, forcing Lum to confront Ataru's true feelings. As their relationship hangs in the balance, a game of tag ensues, with Ataru's victory hinging on his ability to express his love for Lum. However, his pride might just be his undoing.\n\nIn a twist of fate, a long-forgotten deal sealed by Lum's grandfather threatens to separate Lum and Ataru forever. Consumed by anger and deception, Ataru finds himself in a cosmic chase to rescue Lum from the clutches of the merchant. As the thrilling events unfold, the destiny of Ataru, Lum, and their friends will be determined once and for all.",
