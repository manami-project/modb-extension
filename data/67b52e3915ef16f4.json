    "text": "Shizoaki Haruno, a 17-year-old high school girl living in a quaint, rural Japanese town, yearns for a vibrant city life. Her daily commute to school with friends Anri and Sayo on their stylish scooters, passing by the envious Maezono Rie pedaling her bicycle, becomes a catalyst for Rie's determination to obtain her own motorcycle license. Haruno's life takes a turn when her parents, proprietors of Niwa Caf√© and a motorcycle repair shop, hire Cynthia B. Rogers, an adventurous Australian biker. As Cynthia shares tales of her thrilling motorcycle journeys across the globe, Haruno's perspective on her mundane life begins to shift. Inspired by Cynthia's stories and encouraged by the diverse guests at her parents' boardinghouse, Haruno starts to envision a more daring future, reigniting her desire to chase her dreams.",
