  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a bustling modern city, there is a small photo studio called Time Photo Studio. The shop seems ordinary, but it is run by two men with extraordinary abilities - Cheng Xiaoshi and Lu Guang. They have the power to literally enter customers' photographs in order to fulfill special requests. Using their supernatural talents, Cheng and Lu Guang jump into the frozen moments captured in photos, where they relive the events surrounding the image to unlock secrets and change outcomes on behalf of clients. However dangerous the mission, they take on each job with the utmost professionalism. But tampering with past events, no matter how small, always carries great risk. As Cheng and Lu Guang become more embroiled in the personal lives of those in the photos, it takes tremendous focus to set aside their feelings and alter the future only as much as their assignment requires. One wrong action could forever reshape the destiny of the photo's subject and set off unintended consequences. Cheng and Lu Guang have a remarkable gift. But with such power over the past, they must be careful not to lose themselves in the process.",
