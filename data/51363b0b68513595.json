  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Iko is a carefree third grader living in an old house in Tateyama with his four eccentric older brothers. Having tragically lost their parents at a young age, the brothers lovingly raise Iko as their own. Though Iko remains unaware, his brothers share a magical secret - they are immortal wizards with extraordinary powers. While on a seaside family vacation one summer, Iko's ordinary world collides with the extraordinary world of magic and wizardry. As strange events unfold around him, the young boy finds himself drawn deeper into his brothers' mystical lives, unfolding a tale of familial love and fantastical adventure. This mixed-media project aims to connect the modern-day story of Iko and his wizard brothers in anime form with a medieval-era musical exploring similar magical themes. While the anime focuses on present-day Japan, the musical provides a historical contrast by transporting audiences to a time of knights, kings and mythic beasts. Together, these two interwoven stories promise to create a spellbinding multi-genre experience.",
