  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In modern society, a concerning new trend called \"net addiction\" has emerged among youth, characterized by excessive internet and technology use stemming from loneliness, disbelief, and outrage. To combat this epidemic, rehabilitation facilities have been established with the aim of guiding young people back onto the right path. One such facility, however, is revealed to be more prison than rehabilitation center. Hibiki, a young man enrolled to treat his supposed net addiction, soon discovers the disturbing truth. Stripped of his freedom and faced with an environment of despair, Hibiki must find the will to survive and challenge the system. Through encounters with fellow inmates, authority figures, and a mysterious ally named Shin, Hibiki just may find a spark of hope in the darkness. This suspenseful anime promises to delve deep into issues plaguing modern youth, exploring the line between treatment and imprisonment. Viewers are left to wonder - in trying to save young lives, have these facilities only served to extinguish them? As Hibiki fights for his rights and identity, the show also highlights the strength of human connection in even the bleakest of settings.",
