Unbeknownst to her, this mansion lies on the threshold of the human and spirit realms.

Ignoring his warnings to leave, Himari vows to help Aoi break the curse, delving into the enigmatic world of the youkai and uncovering her own family's hidden past. As she embarks on this supernatural journey, Himari is determined to restore Aoi's freedom and unravel the secrets of her bloodline.",
