  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kongo, the manager of the Houseki, assigns each of the 28 members a specific role in their ongoing battle against the Lunarians. These moon-dwelling beings pose a constant threat, seeking to shatter the Houseki and use their fragments as decorations. While some Houseki are tasked with fighting or providing medical assistance, Phos, the youngest member, is given a unique responsibility: to create an encyclopedia detailing the natural history of their world. Despite Phos's aspirations to join the fight against the Lunarians, they find themselves contributing to the cause in a different, yet equally important way. This is the story of Phos and the Houseki, a new form of life born in a distant future.",
