    "text": "That's right! A solitary otaku finds himself reincarnated in a fantastical realm, not as a hero, but as a humble pig. His last memory is of consuming raw pig liver, making his transformation all the more ironic. In this new world, he befriends Jess, a young girl with the extraordinary ability to read minds. Despite his often inappropriate thoughts, Jess sees past his porcine exterior and accepts him as a companion. However, their bond is complicated as Jess harbors plans to eventually consume him. When Jess faces a dark destiny, the pig must rely on his heightened sense of smell and cunning intellect to protect her, forging a unique alliance between a girl and her pig. Will they navigate the prejudices and perils of their world, or will their unconventional bond be their undoing? Join this unlikely duo as they embark on a thought-provoking and heartwarming adventure.",
