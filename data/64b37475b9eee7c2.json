  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After losing a bet, Keiichi and his friends Rena, Mion, Satoko, and Rika are forced to parade around town in silly costumes. Eager to avoid further embarrassment, the group decides to visit the nearby abandoned village of Yagouchi. Once there, Mion tells Keiichi and Rena about a mysterious, haunted quarry located in the village. Seven years ago, two people died there under strange circumstances. Rena's curiosity is piqued and she wants to explore the quarry, but Rika and Mion caution against it, referring ominously to \"the pit.\" It's clear there are sinister secrets surrounding this quarry. Though warned of potential danger, Rena remains fascinated, and she and Keiichi debate whether or not they should investigate further. Just what happened at that quarry seven years ago? And what is this \"pit\" that has Rika and Mion so frightened? The group is tempted to uncover the mystery, but disturbing revelations may await them in the shadows of the abandoned quarry.",
