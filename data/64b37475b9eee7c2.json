  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yagouchi—a once-thriving village now left deserted—becomes the unexpected destination for a group of friends after a playful bet goes awry. Keiichi Maebara, Rena Ryuuguu, Mion Sonozaki, Satoko Houjou, and Rika Furude find themselves parading around in costumes, hoping to avoid the curious eyes of the townspeople. When they stumble upon a fork in the road, the group decides to explore the eerie abandoned village.\n\nAs they delve deeper into Yagouchi, Mion and Rika share whispers of a mysterious quarry, long abandoned and rumored to be haunted. Keiichi and Rena, intrigued by the tale, express their desire to investigate the quarry. However, Mion and Rika hesitate, revealing the quarry's dark past—a place where two people met their untimely demise seven years ago.\n\nWith curiosity piqued and caution in the air, the friends engage in a debate: should they explore the haunted quarry or heed the warnings of its past? The answer lies in the unknown, and the group must decide whether to unravel the mystery or leave the quarry's secrets undisturbed.",
