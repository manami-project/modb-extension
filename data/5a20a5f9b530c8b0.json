  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Son Goku's triumph over Beerus has ushered in a tranquil era on Earth, but the serenity is shattered by the arrival of two sinister henchmen, Sorbet and Tagoma, from the remnants of Frieza's army. Their nefarious mission: to revive their ruthless leader using the mystical Dragon Balls. Frieza, rekindling his vengeful fury against the Saiyans, particularly Goku and Future Trunks, plots his retribution.\n\nUpon learning of Goku's power escalation beyond his previous encounter on Namek, Frieza invests four months into rigorous training, even in the depths of hell, to surpass the strength of Mystic Gohan in his initial form. With Goku and Vegeta absent from Earth, engaged in their own training under Whis, Bulma rallies the remaining warriors to confront the resurrected Frieza and his formidable army, safeguarding the universe from imminent peril.\n\nAs the threat of Frieza looms, the question hangs in the balance: Will Frieza's relentless pursuit of vengeance finally lead to Goku's downfall, or will Goku and his allies rise to the challenge, preserving Earth's fragile peace once more?",
