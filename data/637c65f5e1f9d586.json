  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows two pairs of young lovers whose lives are disrupted by an impending war between the rival kingdoms of Itha and Paro. Itha is portrayed as a flourishing maritime city, blessed with riches and prosperity. In contrast, Paro is depicted as a barren military state, likely fueled by jealousy and greed. The peace between them shatters when Paro's monarch hatches a plan to sabotage Itha and claim its wealth. The first pair of lovers consists of Itha's princess Ahnas and Paro's prince Jill, who have fallen deeply in love despite their kingdoms' animosity. The second pair comprises the young villager Izu, an ambitious man enthralled by the promise of fame and fortune, and his beloved wife Marin. Their lives are upended when Izu leaves to join Paro's army, lured by the reward, while a distraught Marin prays for his safe return. The story seems to caution against the foolishness of war and how easily it destroys lives. It remains to be seen whether the genuine love between Ahnas and Jill and the vows exchanged between Izu and Marin will withstand the devastating impact of the impending conflict. At stake is not only these relationships but also the peace of the humble farming village of Saki caught helplessly in the middle.",
