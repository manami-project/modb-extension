  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yamada-sensei, Doi-sensei, and a host of other colorful characters guide the mischievous trio of Rantarou, Kirimaru, and Shinbei through the rigorous world of Ninjutsu Academy. As first-year students, or 'Nintamas,' they must master the art of ninjutsu, but their love for money, food, and play often leads them astray. Set in the Sengoku Period, each episode of this whimsical anime series offers a delightful mix of slapstick humor, engaging action, and unexpected twists. With seasons spanning 60 to 90 episodes and each episode lasting just 7 minutes and 30 seconds, the adventures of these young ninjas-in-training are as diverse as they are entertaining. Join Rantarou, Kirimaru, Shinbei, and their friends as they navigate the thrilling, unpredictable world of Nintama.",
