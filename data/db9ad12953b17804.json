  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nintama Rantarou follows three young ninja apprentices named Rantarou, Kirimaru, and Shinbei who attend Ninjutsu Academy, a school that trains youths to become ninjas. The first-year students are nicknamed \"Nintamas,\" a play on the words ninja and tama (egg). Though dedicated to their training, Rantarou, Kirimaru and Shinbei often find themselves more interested in goofing off, playing pranks, and chasing girls than perfecting their ninja skills. Their misadventures frequently land them in trouble with their strict teachers like Doi-sensei and the cross-dressing Yamada-sensei. Joining the main trio are their fellow Nintama classmates, the mischievous Kunoichi girl ninjas, rival gangs of ninjas, wacky family members, and even a crew of pirates! With such a big cast of eccentric characters, each 7-30 minute episode over the course of the long-running 29 season series delivers laughs and light-hearted fun.",
