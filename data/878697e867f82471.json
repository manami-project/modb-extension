    "text": "KILLTUBE takes place in an alternate 2026 where Japan remains isolated under the rule of the Edo Shogunate. In this rigidly hierarchical society, three individuals from the lowest social class fatefully meet in prison. Seeking fortune and freedom, they join \"KILLTUBE\", a popular dueling platform where combatants live-stream battles to the death. Initially facing discrimination, the unlikely trio steadily gain fame and celebrity status through continued victories. However, at the height of their popularity, they uncover the dark secrets behind KILLTUBE's success. Fighting against a system designed to keep them down, their struggle epitomizes the oppressed rising up in a segregated world. As they break boundaries and defy expectations, their story explores the themes of social inequality, the price of ambition, and the corrupting nature of power. KILLTUBE offers a thrilling battle spectacle set against thought-provoking societal commentary.",
