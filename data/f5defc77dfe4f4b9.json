    "text": "Kikyou Kiri, a physical education teacher, crosses paths with her childhood friend, Kamikura Hiroki, at Nadeshiko Academy, where he serves as an art teacher and advisor for the high school's art club. Hiroki, once a gifted painter, has inexplicably abandoned his craft, much to the dismay of his cousin, Housen Elis, who is a talented artist herself. Elis, having received a scholarship to the academy after her parents' tragic death, seeks to rekindle Hiroki's passion for painting. As Kiri and Hiroki reconnect, old feelings resurface, but Elis's growing affection for Hiroki complicates matters. Will Hiroki conquer his artistic struggles, and will he choose between the love of his childhood friend or his cousin?",
