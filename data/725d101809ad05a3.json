    "text": "What awaits you in the realm of Gamindustri is a captivating tale of camaraderie, conflict, and cooperation among powerful Goddesses who govern the four distinct nations of Planeptune, Lastation, Lowee, and Leanbox. For ages, these lands have been entangled in a relentless struggle for Shares, the divine source of the Goddesses' might. Fearing that the endless battle would only weaken their territories, the Goddesses agreed to a Friendship Treaty, prohibiting the forceful acquisition of Shares.\n\nThis historic agreement ushered in a vibrant new era, punctuated by moments of laughter, discord, and unity among the Goddesses and their younger siblings. However, not all is well in this fantastical world. Neptune, the fun-loving Goddess of Planeptune, finds herself slacking off and indulging in games, causing her land's Shares to dwindle.\n\nJoin Neptune and her companions as they strive to restore the Shares and confront an ominous menace that looms over both the Goddesses and Gamindustri itself. The future of this enchanting world hangs in the balance, and only time will reveal what destiny has in store for Gamindustri and its divine rulers.",
