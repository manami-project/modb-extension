    "text": "Years after being captivated by the thrilling tales of the pirate 'Red-Haired' Shanks, Monkey D. Luffy embarks on his own pirate journey, inspired by his childhood dreams. When Luffy unintentionally consumes the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit, his life takes a drastic turn, granting him the ability to stretch like rubber but also cursing him with the inability to swim. Determined to become the king of the pirates, Luffy sets sail on a solitary rowboat, seeking the world's greatest treasure, the legendary 'One Piece.'\n\nTo celebrate the 25th anniversary of the ONE PIECE anime, Netflix and WIT Studio are collaborating to bring a fresh adaptation of the beloved manga to life. This new anime will reimagine the original story, starting from the iconic East Blue saga, inviting both new and old fans alike to join Luffy on his daring adventure.",
