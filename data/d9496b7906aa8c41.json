    "text": "Fujiya Kotobuki, a vibrant and fashion-forward 14-year-old girl, has a penchant for exploring specialty shops, gift stores, and clothing boutiques. Her favorite among these is 'Galopine Et Galopin', a trendy clothing store in Harajuku run by the talented and handsome fashion designer, Hodaka. Despite the age gap, Kotobuki finds herself smitten by Hodaka's quiet charm and growing popularity in the fashion world.\n\nIn an attempt to bridge the gap between them, Kotobuki decides to lie about her age, hoping to get closer to the 26-year-old Hodaka. Initially, Hodaka remains reserved and distant, but the arrival of a mysterious young man named Kazuomi seeking part-time employment at the boutique brings unexpected changes to their relationship dynamics.\n\nAs Kotobuki navigates the complexities of love, deceit, and the fashion world, she must confront the challenges that arise from her lies and the potential conflicts in her budding relationship with Hodaka. Will their bond survive the trials ahead, or will Kotobuki find herself lost in a world of glamour and pretense?",
