  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Licht Bach, a masked vagabond bearing a count of -999, crosses paths with Hina, a determined young traveler, in the world of Alcia. In this realm, each individual is branded with a 'Count' that dictates their social standing and can lead to their doom if it reaches zero. Hina's mother met this very fate, leaving Hina with a mission to seek out the legendary Aces, heroes of a war that took place three centuries ago. As Hina and Licht journey together, they uncover the truth about their world, the dreaded Abyss, and the enigmatic Aces. Along the way, they encounter Nana, a tavern owner, and face challenges like battles with military soldiers. Based on Yuu Minazuki's manga, \"Plunderer\" follows Hina and her companions as they navigate a world ruled by numbers and unravel its mysteries.",
