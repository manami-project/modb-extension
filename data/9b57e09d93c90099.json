  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sho Zama is an ordinary teenager whose life is changed forever when he's mysteriously transported from Earth to the mystical medieval world of Byston Well. There, Sho discovers he has been recruited by the ambitious Lord Drake Luft to pilot a powerful weapon called an Aura Battler - a giant insectoid mecha fueled by magic. Initially forced to fight for Drake's political agenda to expand his territory, Sho has a change of heart when he meets Marvel Frozen, a defiant young woman leading a rebellion against Drake's rule. Realizing the tyrant's sinister intentions, Sho chooses to turn against him and join Marvel's resistance movement, led by Neal Given. Together with Riml, Drake's own daughter working secretly with the rebels, Sho and his new allies fight desperately to stop Drake's plans before the villain gains control over Byston Well. Using his own strong aura abilities, Sho takes control of an Aura Battler and plunges into an epic conflict where magic and mecha collide, and the fate of Byston Well hangs in the balance.",
