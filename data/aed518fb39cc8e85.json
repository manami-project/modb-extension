    "text": "And so, amidst the desolate ruins of a forgotten city, a chilling game of hide-and-seek known as 'Otokoyo' unfolds. Children don fox masks and venture into the eerie labyrinth, only to vanish without a trace. As whispers of ghosts and demons fill the air, one boy named Hikora steps forward, driven by the unyielding determination to find his missing sister, who fell victim to the game. Joined by seven others, each with their own reasons for playing, they soon realize that the line between rumor and reality blurs in this deadly game, where survival becomes the ultimate prize. As the street lamps flicker and the shadows dance, the terrifying ordeal begins, leaving the players to wonder if they will ever escape the clutches of Otokoyo.",
