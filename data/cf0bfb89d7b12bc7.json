  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Upon the backdrop of 2063, where interstellar travel has become commonplace, a group of nine enthusiastic students from Caird High School embark on an exhilarating journey to Planet McPa for a unique camping experience. Among them is the lively Aries Spring, whose excitement is quickly dampened when a peculiar, sentient-like orb catapults them into the uncharted depths of space, leaving them stranded 5012 light-years away from home.\n\nFortunately, they stumble upon an abandoned spaceship, the Astra, which becomes their beacon of hope and temporary sanctuary. To navigate the treacherous path back home, these students must rally together, harnessing their collective strength, resourcefulness, and camaraderie. As they traverse the cosmos, they'll face trials that will test their mettle in ways their camping trip never could, turning their school excursion into an epic voyage of survival and self-discovery. Join Aries Spring and her fellow astronauts in \"Astra Lost in Space,\" an anime adaptation of Kenta Shinohara's enthralling manga, as they brave the vast expanse of space together.",
