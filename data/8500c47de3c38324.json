  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Naota is a young boy living a mundane life in a sleepy town, spending his days with Mamimi, his brother's ex-girlfriend, since his brother moved away. One day, Naota's routine is interrupted when he meets Haruko, an eccentric girl who rides a scooter and carries a bass guitar. After literally running into Naota, Haruko whacks him with her guitar, causing a horn to grow from Naota's forehead. As Haruko moves into Naota's home, his days become increasingly chaotic and supernatural. Robots sprout from Naota's head as he gets caught up in a corporation's secret plans. All the while, the offbeat Haruko engages in questionable antics, flustering and confusing Naota. Once desiring nothing more than normalcy, Naota finds himself dragged into a mind-bending adventure mixing music, aliens, battling robots, and the pains of adolescence. In the process, the cynical boy gains maturity in the face of absurdity.",
