Riding a Vespa and wielding a bass guitar, Haruko crashes into Naota, leaving tire tracks and a horn sprouting from his forehead. As if this wasn't strange enough, Haruko inexplicably becomes his housekeeper, dragging Naota into a whirlwind of chaos involving robots, aliens, and intergalactic battles.
