  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ever since a mysterious illness began transforming the inhabitants of Planie into the undead 150 years ago, the once-thriving town has been plagued by darkness. As the disease spreads, Planie earns the grim nickname of \"the cursed city.\" A glimmer of hope arrives in the form of Kanae, a priest who takes up residence in a church on the outskirts of the town. As if by divine intervention, the number of cases of the disease begins to decline following Kanae's arrival. But when a cryptic stranger joins Kanae, the fate of the town is forever altered. Unbeknownst to the townspeople, the enigmatic stranger is none other than Alexander \"Kuzuha\" Lagusa, a vampire hailing from Devildom. Kuzuha is on a mission to eliminate an escaped sorcerer, and as he and Kanae delve deeper into the mystery of the disease, they discover that it is inextricably linked to the sorcerer. With the stakes higher than ever, Kanae and Kuzuha form an unlikely alliance to save Planie and uncover the truth behind the curse. This gripping tale serves as the backstory for the beloved Japanese V-Tubers Kanae and Kuzuha.",
