  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The spotlight shines on 16 ordinary girls as they embark on an extraordinary journey to realize their dreams of becoming local idols in the vibrant city of Sagamihara. In a refreshing twist, this anime shifts the focus from the usual cutthroat competition to become the 'top idol' and instead highlights the girls' dedication and energy in enlivening their city through idol activities. As the Tsubu Doll members, these girls are not your typical idols but rather local idols who are deeply rooted in their community. With a variety of events, a drama CD, and a radio program planned, this anime promises to not only entertain but also revitalize Sagamihara and bring its viewers closer to the heartwarming world of local idols.",
