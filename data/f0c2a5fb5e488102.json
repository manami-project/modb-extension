  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers on a group of 16 teenage girls living in the city of Sagamihara who all share the dream of becoming idols and performing on stage. Rather than competing to become mainstream celebrities, these local idols are focused on bringing excitement and energy to their hometown through local idol activities. We follow the daily lives of the Tsubu Doll members as they pursue their passion for singing, dancing, and connecting with their local fans. Whether it's putting on street performances, making radio programs, recording CDs, or organizing local events, the girls devote themselves wholeheartedly to revitalizing Sagamihara with their youthful spirit. While the path to stardom is often portrayed as cutthroat, this heartwarming anime highlights the cooperative side of following one's dreams. Through both the ups and downs, the Tsubu Doll idols support each other, spread joy, and work together to achieve their shared goal of becoming local idols beloved by their community.",
