    "text": "School is back in session for the brave crew of the Harekaze at Yokosuka Girls' Marine High School, but their future as a team hangs in the balance. After their heroic victory against the Musashi, the Harekaze lies critically damaged, and whispers of its dissolution spread through the school. The crew's morale is further tested as other classes try to poach their members, leaving their unity more uncertain than ever.\n\nAs they recover from midterm exams, a new mission arises for Coco, but the fate of the Harekaze remains the pressing concern. With time running out, the key to their predicament may lie in the sealed orders entrusted to Kouko Nosa, the ship's secretary. Can these orders turn the tide for the Harekaze and its crew, or will they be forced to disband and sail with different ships?\n\nThe crew anxiously awaits the distribution of the sealed envelopes, hoping for a solution that will keep them together. As rumors swirl and other captains eye their talented members, the girls of the Harekaze must stand strong and face whatever challenges lie ahead. Will they be able to embark on another thrilling sea adventure together, or will this be the end of their journey as a team?",
