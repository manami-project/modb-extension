    "text": "Alchemists have resurrected renowned writers from history, confining their souls within a vast library. These reincarnated authors, including Osamu Dazai and Ryunosuke Akutagawa, are tasked with venturing into tainted books to purge the malevolent entities known as Taints that have corrupted the stories. Alongside their fellow writers, they must also rescue and recruit other authors trapped within the narratives they once penned. As they embark on this mission, some struggle to recall their past lives and works, while others retain their former selves. Despite the seemingly endless task, they remain dedicated to uncovering the truth behind their collective resurrection and the enigmatic Alchemist. Join these legendary authors as they navigate through labyrinthine libraries and battle the forces of darkness to restore the purity of the written word.",
