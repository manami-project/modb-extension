    "text": "Kazuaki Terasawa takes the director's chair in this captivating original short, a collaborative effort between WIT STUDIO and studio Kafka. The narrative unfolds the transformative journey of a young girl, Hina, following her chance encounter with an enigmatic creature. This creature, a Yeti, is an entity previously unknown to Hina, characterized by its white shaggy fur. As the winter chill sets in, an unlikely bond forms between the two, leading Hina to gain new insights and perspectives about life. The short was first showcased at a preview screening event alongside 'Mahoutsukai no Yome SEASON 2' episode one at Tachikawa Cinema City's Cinema Two in Tokyo on March 11, 2023. It was subsequently uploaded onto JUNNA's YouTube channel on March 18, 2023, and will also be featured in the limited first edition of JUNNA's 5th anniversary 3rd full album 'Dear' (CD+Blu-ray), set to release on April 12, 2023.",
