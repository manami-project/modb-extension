    "text": "Kotoko Iwanaga had her life forever changed when she was kidnapped by spirits known as yokai as a young girl. In exchange for becoming the yokai's 'God of Wisdom' - a mediator between the spirit world and humanity - Kotoko lost her right eye and left leg. Now 17, Kotoko uses her unique position to help resolve issues between benevolent yokai and humans. However, some dangerous yokai threaten the balance. When Kotoko meets university student Kurou Sakuragawa, she senses he has a special encounter with the supernatural himself. She soon confirms Kurou has mystical healing abilities after tangling with a yokai. Kotoko develops feelings for Kurou over time and suggests they team up. Together, they work to handle threats posed by hostile yokai and solve supernatural mysteries. As they cooperate, Kotoko hopes Kurou may someday reciprocate her budding romantic affection. But for now, the two make an unlikely duo protecting the line between the worlds of spirits and humans.",
