  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime short film tells the poignant story of a young girl searching for her identity amidst the grand natural landscapes of Hokkaido, Japan. Directed and animated by Takuji Miyamoto, with an evocative musical score by sooogood!, the film explores the universal theme of finding oneself, using the metaphor of the girl becoming lost both physically and spiritually in the wilderness. Through Miyamoto's animation, we follow the girl as she wanders alone through forests, fields, and mountains, struggling with inner turmoil. The turning point comes when she has an epiphany while gazing at her reflection in a pool of water, realizing that the answer she seeks lies within. Thereafter, she finds peace and a sense of belonging in the nature around her. In crafting this film, Miyamoto wished to capture the range of emotions people may experience when immersed in Hokkaido's majestic natural beauty. Currently being screened at New Chitose Airport to reach international audiences, the film is a poetic ode to the human journey of self-discovery. With its lush visuals and universal message, it promises to resonate with viewers as they reflect on their own understanding of identity.",
