    "text": "Karasuno High School's volleyball team faces their toughest opponent yet in the finals of the Miyagi preliminaries for the Spring Tournament. Their adversary is the powerhouse Shiratorizawa Academy, undefeated champions led by Wakatoshi Ushijima, one of Japan's top three high school aces. Despite Karasuno's recent growth, Shiratorizawa dominates early on. Ushijima's vicious spikes and the blocking of Shiratorizawa's middle blocker Tendo overwhelm Karasuno. However, the tide starts to turn with the brilliant play of Karasuno's own middle blocker Tsukishima. His precision defense enables freak quick attacks from Hinata and Kageyama. Two contrasting teams and philosophies clash in a desperate, hard-fought struggle. Karasuno fights to continue their underdog run, while the mighty Shiratorizawa seeks to cement their dominance. Though outmatched on paper, Karasuno refuses to back down, fueled by their dream of nationals and the taunts of Ushijima. This battle of wills comes down to which team can best execute their strategy while facing the highest level of competition.",
