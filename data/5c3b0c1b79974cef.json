  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This lighthearted parody offers a humorous behind-the-scenes look at the making of the sci-fi anime film \"Gall Force: Eternal Story.\" Chibi versions of the Gall Force characters play exaggerated versions of themselves as they try, and often hilariously fail, to complete filming amidst chaos and mishaps. Lufy speeds onto the set and crashes her car into the stage, Rabby unwittingly uses a \"toilet\" that has a crew member trapped underneath, and Eluza's shower scene goes embarrassingly awry when a camera set up by the lecherous Shounen records her naked. Other ridiculous out-takes and bloopers pile up, leaving the flustered director wondering if they can ever finish the movie. Despite multiple snafus and off-the-wall antics, the spunky female stars persevere with good humor. After a disastrous premiere filled with catty infighting about who is the most popular, the friends makeup and band together, demonstrating the same solidarity and girl power that make \"Gall Force\" so beloved by its fans.",
