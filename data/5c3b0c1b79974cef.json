  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aside from the usual glitz and glamour of movie-making, the studios of Gall Force: Eternal Story are filled with chaos and hilarity in this wacky parody of 'Making of' documentaries. The chibi-styled characters from Gall Force: Eternal Story are brought to life in a series of out-takes and strange occurrences, with humor often derived from the relationships between the characters and the movie itself. From Lufy's disastrous car crash on set to Rabby's toilet mishap, Eluza's shower accident, and Shounen's ill-placed camera, the filming process is fraught with embarrassing incidents and calamities. Despite the mayhem, the cast and crew persevere, resulting in a film that is as much a product of the behind-the-scenes pandemonium as it is of the actual script. The premiere, however, brings forth a new challenge as the girls engage in a popularity contest, proving that the drama is not just confined to the screen. This parody offers a fresh and humorous take on the Gall Force: Eternal Story, inviting viewers to witness the chaos and laughter that ensues when things don't go as planned.",
