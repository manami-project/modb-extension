As he anticipates their celebration at Shichirigahama beach, he encounters a young girl bearing a striking resemblance to Mai during her child acting days. As Sakuta grapples with this enigmatic encounter, his father contacts him with unexpected news: Sakuta's mother, who has struggled to accept Kaede's circumstances, expresses her desire to see her long-hospitalized daughter. In an effort to honor their mother's wish, Sakuta and Kaede decide to reunite with her, an event that leaves Sakuta visibly anxious. As they prepare for this emotional meeting, Sakuta discovers mysterious scars appearing on his body, potentially hinting at an unseen form of puberty syndrome.",
