    "text": "Marginal #4 is a fresh new idol group determined to make it big in the entertainment industry. Managed by Pythagoras Productions, the four members - Atom, Rui, L, and R - bring boundless energy and passion to the stage. Though still rookies, Marginal #4 aims to follow in the footsteps of their popular senior group Lagrange Point. When not performing, the boys try to live normal high school lives. But between chaotic classes, securing a club room, filming commercials, and all the hijinks in between, their days are anything but ordinary! Still, the group takes it all in enthusiastic stride, supporting each other like family. As Marginal #4 continues pursuing their dreams, they hope to mature into world-class idols capable of delivering their kisses to the galaxy's edge. With their youthful charm and determination, they just may have what it takes to conquer the entertainment world - and win over legions of adoring fans!",
