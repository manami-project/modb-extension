  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akane Hiyama, the school's most admired girl, and Aino Seiji, an ordinary high school student, find themselves unwittingly entangled in a web of supernatural romance. The catalyst? A magical notebook known as a Kiss Note, wielded by an angelic cupid named Guri. When Guri inadvertently writes Seiji's name in the Kiss Note, she sets off a chain of events that could lead to dire consequences: if Seiji doesn't lock lips with someone within 24 hours, Guri will meet her demise, and Seiji is doomed to a life of celibacy.\n\nIn a desperate bid to avoid this fate, Seiji is coerced into kissing his long-time crush, Akane. But this is no ordinary crush; Akane's feelings for Seiji teeter on the edge of obsession, revealing a darker, more psychotic side to the popular girl. As if this weren't complicated enough, Guri finds herself developing feelings for Seiji, further entangling the trio in a complex love triangle.\n\nSeiji, who once dreamed of a normal, uncomplicated relationship, now finds himself navigating a tumultuous romantic landscape. With the stakes high and the situation growing increasingly convoluted, Seiji must juggle his feelings, the affections of two very different girls, and the responsibility of assisting Guri in her cupid duties. All the while, he yearns for the simple, ordinary life he once knew.",
