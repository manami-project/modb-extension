  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Each episode of this animated variety show, created by the renowned Monkey Punch, is a delightful 52-minute extravaganza that aired on WOWOW. The series, which ran from July 31, 2004, to June 25, 2005, comprises 12 episodes, along with a special 15-minute DVD exclusive titled \"Crime Mate.\" The show is cleverly segmented into Mini Stages, lasting 15 minutes, and Grand Stages, lasting 30 minutes, with 60-second interludes peppered throughout. Fans of Monkey Punch will be thrilled to see beloved Lupin characters appear in silent, visually-driven 60-second segments called \"The Lupin Gang.\" Additionally, these characters make an appearance in the \"Mankatsu Monkey\" segments, which feature a monkey with a penchant for saying 'Mankatsu.' This series is a delightful medley of Monkey Punch's signature humor, ecchi-gags, and iconic characters, making it a must-watch for fans and newcomers alike.",
