    "text": "Now, imagine being reborn into a magical realm with the assurance of extraordinary powers, only to find yourself discarded as a powerless infant by royal parents who fail to recognize your true potential! Meet Haruto, once a reclusive 20-year-old, now reincarnated as Prince Reinhardt, gifted with magical abilities that surpass the charts but remain unnoticed by his royal family. Abandoned in the woods, Haruto's life takes a turn when he encounters Flay, a Flame Fenrir who pledges her loyalty to him, recognizing his immense power. Adopted by his relative, Gold Zenfis, Haruto spends nine years honing his overpowered barrier magic in secret, preferring to keep his abilities hidden from his new family. However, when his younger sister, Charlotte, discovers his strength, Haruto must use his magic to protect his loved ones from impending danger. Despite his desire to live a life of tranquility and seclusion, Haruto must navigate through a world filled with magic and treachery, all while trying to keep his family safe and maintain his facade of weakness.",
