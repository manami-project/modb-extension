  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sakurako, Ayano, and the rest of the Amusement Club and student council members embark on a series of end-of-summer adventures in these two bonus episodes of Yuru Yuri Nachuyachumi! In the first episode, the girls engage in a lively water balloon fight, accidentally sparking a ghost rumor in the process. As they wind down, they take turns capturing memories with their cameras and reminiscing about their recent camping trip. The second episode finds the Amusement Club enjoying a sleepover at Yui's house, complete with video games and laughter. Meanwhile, the student council members hold their own sleepover, where Sakurako takes the opportunity to express her gratitude towards Ayano for her constant support. These heartwarming episodes aired on TV in 2015, accompanied by new opening and ending theme songs.",
