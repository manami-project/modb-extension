    "text": "After surviving a vampire attack, high school student Koyomi Araragi notices concerning changes in his friend and savior Tsubasa Hanekawa. When he sees her with an odd bandage on her face, his worries grow. Hanekawa insists it is nothing and pleads for his discretion, but fate intervenes when they witness a strange cat get hit by a car. Seeking answers, Araragi consults his friend Meme Oshino, an expert on the supernatural. Oshino reveals the cat to be an apparition that has possessed Hanekawa in her stressed mental state. Araragi races to find Hanekawa, discovering she has attacked her parents while under the malevolent cat's influence. To save his friend who once saved him, Araragi must free Hanekawa from the sinister curse before more harm is done. Their ordeal triggers a harrowing nine days that will test the bonds of friendship.",
