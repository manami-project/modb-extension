    "text": "Hanabata Nohkins, Hitamu 'Hitamuuki' Kyan, Maidena Ange, and Toxico Dannar are the four promising newcomers assigned to Kikuru Madan, the most accomplished hunter in the Adventurer's Guild. Kikuru, who has spent his entire childhood perfecting his hunting skills, now yearns for a peaceful retirement to enjoy his youth. However, his dream seems to be slipping away as he struggles to train his successors. Hitamu, in particular, is extraordinarily clumsy and constantly gets into trouble with monsters. To make matters worse, the monsters outside Mebuki's walls have developed a strange fascination with women, causing endless problems for Kikuru and his trainees. Despite these challenges, Kikuru remains determined to retire early and pass on his legacy to the next generation of hunters. Will he be able to whip his unruly apprentices into shape and secure the future of the guild? Only time will tell in this exciting and unpredictable adventure.",
