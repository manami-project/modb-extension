  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yukito Kunisaki is a wanderer on a quest to find the \"girl in the sky\" from his family legend about a winged maiden bound to the heavens long ago. His journey brings him to a sleepy seaside town, where he crosses paths with an unusual local girl named Misuzu. She quickly befriends Yukito and convinces him to stay in town for a while. As Yukito connects with the small community and temporarily puts his longtime search on hold, he gets entangled in the lives of Misuzu and others in town. In time, he discovers that his new friend seems to harbor a strange, otherworldly secret somehow tied to the very legend that set him wandering years ago. Over the course of a summer in this unassuming place, the threads of fate draw Yukito deeper into a mystery spanning centuries. Friendships are forged, secrets revealed, and destinies intertwined. Could his family legend and quest for the winged girl inexplicably involve the smiling girl standing before him?",
