    "text": "On the mystical Floating Lights Island in the Eastern Sea, nature flourishes with abundant spiritual energy. However, three hundred years ago a surge of sinister spirits plunged the island into chaos. To save Floating Lights, the divine Cat God Lan performed a powerful ritual under an ancient mountain tree, driving away the evil spirits. In gratitude, the islanders built the Floating Lights Temple to honor the Cat God. A protective enchantment now shields the island, keeping monsters at bay. Additionally, some fortunate cats have gained the mystical ability to transform into human-like beings with cat ears and tails, assisting the Cat God in safeguarding Floating Lights Island and its inhabitants. Though darkness once befell this island paradise, hope and harmony now prevail thanks to the bravery and magic of the Cat God and his feline followers.",
