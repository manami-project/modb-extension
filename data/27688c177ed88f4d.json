  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Three centuries ago, the tranquil island of Fuguang, nestled in the heart of the Eastern Sea, was besieged by a horde of malevolent spirits, disrupting its serene beauty and spiritual harmony. In a bid to restore peace, the divine feline entity, Lan, invoked powerful spells under the boughs of an ancient mountain tree. The grateful islanders commemorated this act by constructing a shrine beneath the tree, establishing a protective aura that has since kept the island safe from monstrous threats. This divine intervention also bestowed a unique gift upon certain felines, enabling them to assume human form, albeit retaining their distinctive cat ears and tails. This enchanting tale unfolds on an island where spiritual energy is abundant and the line between humans and cats delightfully blurs.",
