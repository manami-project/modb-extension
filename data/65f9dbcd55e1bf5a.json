Eager to embark on a life of cooking, cleaning, and serving her new master, Yui finds herself in the midst of an unexpected twist. Takaya, driven by his vivid imagination and creative flair, has a unique set of plans for his new companion. Instead of the mundane chores she anticipated, Yui is thrust into a world of elaborate costumes and fantastical dress-ups, much to her initial chagrin.
