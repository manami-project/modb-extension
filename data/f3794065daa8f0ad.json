  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a seaside town during the late 19th century, a young Asian woman nicknamed \"Miss China\" runs a restaurant and boarding house called Tenkai. Among her tenants are Breckenridge, an eccentric inventor constantly behind on rent, and Jim, a kind-hearted apprentice watchmaker who has caught China's attention. When Breckenridge creates an astonishing new invention allowing travel to the moon, the skeptical townspeople doubt its legitimacy. Motivated by his affection for China, Jim hatches a clever plan: he will use the invention to retrieve the most beautiful ring on Earth from the moon itself to gift to China. With the \"spirit of wonder\" on their side, the three unlikely companions embark on a whimsical adventure beyond the stars and back, proving the power of imagination along the way. Full of quirky characters and fantastical hijinks, this story celebrates curiosity, romance, and the magic that happens when we open our minds to the possibility of the impossible.",
