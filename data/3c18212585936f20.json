He gifts Ban Chao a bronze swallow talisman and asks him to uncover the secret to immortality and locate a legendary golden Buddha from the emperor's dreams. To aid in this quest, Ban Chao assembles a team of 36 capable individuals, including martial arts masters, heirs of the Mo clan, former pirates, and a spiritual medium from Yelang. Together, they set out on a perilous journey beyond the edges of the Han empire. Ban Chao has ulterior motives as well. He hopes to uncover his family history and expose the true criminal behind his father's wrongful prosecution. Along the way, Ban Chao and his team will face numerous threats and uncover secrets that may shake the foundations of the Han dynasty.",
