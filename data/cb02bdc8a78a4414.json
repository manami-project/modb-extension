    "text": "Mari is a dog who has recently given birth to three puppies. Their lives are suddenly disrupted when a devastating earthquake strikes their hometown of Yamakoshimura. In the aftermath of the quake, Mari's owner becomes trapped in the rubble of their now destroyed home. Driven by love and loyalty, Mari manages to break free of her chains and stays steadfastly by her owner's side, offering what comfort she can until help finally arrives. Though Mari's owner survives, he is unable to care for the dogs. Heartbreakingly, Mari and her three puppies are left behind in the abandoned ruins of the village they once called home. With no one left to depend on but each other, this little canine family faces an uncertain yet hopeful future, relying now solely on their bonds of devotion to survive in a changed world.",
