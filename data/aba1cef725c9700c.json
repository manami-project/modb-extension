  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In November 1998, a shocking double homicide occurs at the newly built Ogawa apartment complex in Mifune City. The prime suspect is Tomoe Enjou, a teenage runaway, who encounters Shiki Ryougi and convinces her of his guilt. In an unexpected move, Shiki allows Tomoe to hide out in her apartment, leading to a strange cohabitation. However, the mystery deepens when Tomoe sees his mother alive - the very woman he insists he murdered. Shiki and Tomoe investigate, only to find both of Tomoe's parents living in the Ogawa Complex, unraveling his account. There, Shiki uncovers that master mage Souren Araya has orchestrated the perplexing events to ensnare her. Trapped in an elaborate scheme filled with paradoxes, Shiki realizes this is only the beginning of Araya's vicious plot against his rival, the sorceress Touko. The mind-bending story and occult forces at work make Mujun Rasen a dark, thrilling addition to the Kara no Kyoukai series.",
