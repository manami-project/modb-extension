    "text": "The realm of Fairyland is on the brink of collapse, as the essence of happiness that stems from people's hearts - the Happiness Tones - begins to vanish, causing flowers to wilt and the worlds of beloved fairytale princesses to fade away. In order to restore harmony and save Fairyland, the Queen sends three magical creatures, Sei, Dai, and Ryoku, to the human world on a mission to find three special girls who can embody the legendary princesses and become the 'Super Miracle Idols'.\n\nIn the human world, three ordinary girls - Natsuki, Ringo, and Layla - are about to embark on an extraordinary journey. As they encounter the magical creatures, they are bestowed with the power to transform into the idol group 'Lilpri', tasked with the responsibility of collecting Happiness Tones from humans and restoring the fading fairytale worlds.\n\nAfter an unexpected debut at a popular idol's concert, the girls become the sensation known as 'Little Princesses' or 'LilPri'. As they captivate audiences with their enchanting performances, they must also balance their newfound fame and the weight of saving Fairyland, proving that happiness can indeed be found in the most unexpected places.",
