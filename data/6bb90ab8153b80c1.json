  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ten Count tells the story of Tadaomi Shirotani, a corporate secretary struggling with severe mysophobia, an abnormal fear of germs and contamination. His life changes when he meets Riku Kurose, a therapist who recognizes Shirotani's condition and offers to guide him through a personalized 10-step program to help overcome his phobia. As Shirotani works through touching items he finds disgusting in ascending order of difficulty, he slowly opens up to Kurose, forming a bond of trust and friendship. Over time, Shirotani's feelings gradually grow into attraction and love. Originally planned as an anime series, Ten Count was greenlit for a feature film set to release in 2023. However, despite anticipation from fans, production was cancelled in January 2024 due to undisclosed reasons. Though disappointing for eager viewers, one can still enjoy the story through the popular manga source material.",
