    "text": "After much anticipation, the anime adaptation of the manga \"Ten Count\" has been regretfully cancelled due to production issues. The story revolves around Tadaomi Shirotani, a secretary grappling with an extreme case of mysophobia, causing him to recoil at the thought of contact with germs. His life takes a turn when he encounters Riku Kurose, a therapist who extends a free treatment offer to help Tadaomi overcome his phobia. The therapy involves a ten-step program, with each step targeting a specific fear. As they journey through the program, a bond forms between Tadaomi and Riku, leading to an unexpected attraction. Despite the cancellation, the intriguing narrative of \"Ten Count\" remains a compelling read in its original manga format.",
