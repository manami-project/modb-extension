    "text": "Celty Sturluson, an underground courier in Ikebukuro, is tasked with delivering a suspicious red handbag that several organizations are trying to obtain. As Celty attempts to complete the delivery, she is chased by mysterious foreigners speaking an unknown language. The commotion draws many of Ikebukuro's residents into the conflict, including Mikado and his friends who get swept up in the events while trying to enjoy a summer festival. Meanwhile, famous actor Yuuhei Hanejima arrives in Ikebukuro to search for a couple to feature in his next movie. However, Yuuhei is actually Kasuka Heiwajima, the younger brother of Shizuo. When an anonymous internet user threatens Kasuka's life, they soon realize the gravity of provoking Shizuo's wrath. In addition, two strange incidents transpire - the supposed sighting of a UFO over Ikebukuro, and a wagon disappearing on the highway, pursued by men in suits. While the true nature of these events remains unclear, they add an air of mystery and intrigue to the chaos unfolding in the city.",
