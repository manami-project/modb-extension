  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gijinka Keikaku, an international initiative, has ushered in a new era of tranquility following humanity's protracted struggle against colossal monsters known as kaiju. In this peaceful epoch, an extraordinary phenomenon has emerged: the birth of young girls with dual souls—one human, the other kaiju. These unique beings, christened 'Kaiju Girls,' possess the ability to metamorphose into the very creatures that once threatened our existence.\n\nThe International Kaiju Rescue and Mentoring Organization, or GIRLS, has taken on the responsibility of guiding these Kaiju Girls in harnessing their formidable powers and integrating them into society. Among the newest members of GIRLS are three distinct individuals: the reserved Aki Miyashita, who harbors the soul of Agira; the earnest Reika Shiragane, who inherits Windom; and the vivacious Miku Ushimaru, who receives Miclas.\n\nAs these young girls navigate their newfound abilities and grapple with their monstrous impulses, they embark on a poignant, thrilling, and occasionally lighthearted journey. With the support of their peers, they strive to understand the true essence of being a Kaiju Girl—a fusion of human spirit and kaiju might. This is their tale of courage, self-discovery, and the peculiar destiny they share.",
