    "text": "Kuno's relentless pursuit to defeat Ranma leads him to acquire a mysterious egg, believed to contain the mythical Phoenix's power. However, when the egg hatches on his head, the Phoenix refuses to leave, causing chaos and destruction throughout Tokyo while perched on Kuno's head. In a desperate attempt to remove the bird, Kuno and his friends feed it growth pills, only for the Phoenix to grow to an enormous size, further intensifying its rampage. It's up to Ranma, Akane, Ryouga, Shampoo, and Ukyou to devise a plan and force the Phoenix to leave Kuno's head, putting an end to its destructive spree.",
