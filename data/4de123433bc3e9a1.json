  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kuno Tatewaki, the self-proclaimed arch rival of Ranma Saotome, acquires a mysterious egg in hopes that it contains the mythical powers of the Phoenix that could finally lead to Ranma's defeat. However, things quickly go awry when the egg unexpectedly hatches atop Kuno's head. The newborn Phoenix chick refuses to leave its perch, yet continues growing rapidly after being fed special pills. Soon the enormous, unruly bird begins rampaging through Tokyo, with the hapless Kuno still attached. Ranma and his allies Akane, Ryoga, Shampoo and Ukyo must join forces to subdue the raging creature. After an epic battle across the city, they finally scare the Phoenix off of Kuno’s head, forcing it to fly away and restoring peace. Though Kuno’s dream of conquering Ranma remains unfulfilled, at least the destructive Phoenix has moved on to new horizons.",
