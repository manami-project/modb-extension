  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hamaji Youhei is an aimless high school freshman who struggles to find direction and purpose. He lazes around, rarely studies, and gives up easily on sports or other activities. Youhei is also desperate for female attention but continuously rejected. When a sophomore convinces him to join a club where he can get close with girls, Youhei impulsively joins the water polo team. However, his inability to commit poses a challenge. As Youhei spends time with the team and plays water polo, he may discover motivation, responsibility, and friendship. Yet the question remains â€” can someone who never sticks to anything finally find his place? This anime follows Youhei's humorous but meaningful coming-of-age journey as an apathetic boy who joins water polo on a whim. Alongside the sport and team antics, he faces the deeper challenge of learning to push himself.",
