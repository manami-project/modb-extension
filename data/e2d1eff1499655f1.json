  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so, the curtains close on Araragi Koyomi's high school life, as he stands on the precipice of college. But the morning after his graduation, an ordinary bathroom ritual takes an extraordinary turn. As he gazes into the mirror, his reflection seems to stare back with a life of its own. On a whim, he reaches out, only to find his fingers sinking into the glass. When he regains consciousness, he finds himself in a world that is a twisted mirror image of his own, where familiar faces bear unfamiliar expressions, and the laws of reality seem to have been turned on their head. As Araragi navigates this strange new world, he realizes that there's more to his predicament than meets the eye. This is the continuation of a dream forgotten, a tale of the bizarre and the supernatural that unfolds in 'Zoku Owarimonogatari'.",
