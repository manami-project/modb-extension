  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Edward and Alphonse Elric are gifted young alchemists who lose much at a young age when they attempt the forbidden act of human transmutation in an effort to resurrect their deceased mother. When the transmutation backfires horribly, Edward loses his left leg while Alphonse loses his entire body. In a desperate bid to save his brother, Edward sacrifices his right arm to bind Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. Now with Edward's limbs replaced by automail prosthetics, the brothers set out on a quest to find the mythical Philosopher's Stone which is said to allow alchemists to override the fundamental law of equivalent exchange. They believe the Stone holds the key to restoring their bodies. Edward's reputation as a brilliant alchemist earns him the title of Fullmetal Alchemist as he joins the military, gaining privileged access to research that may lead to the Stone. However, the Elrics uncover dark secrets about the extravagant powers of the Stone, bringing them to the center of a far-reaching conspiracy. To obtain their ultimate goal, the brothers must unravel the mystery surrounding the Stone while confronting those who seek its power for more sinister aims. Their enduring devotion to each other is tested as they face escalating dangers and find their quest is far more complex than they ever imagined.",
