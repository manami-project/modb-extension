    "text": "Tadeshi Daiba has been duped by Alberich, a member of an ancient race that once ruled the universe, into creating the Ring of the Niebelung. This device will enable Alberich to restore their power, leading to chaos and destruction. The legendary treasure, the magical gold of Rhein, has been stolen, and the ancient gods have awakened to reclaim their legacy. Now, the universe is on the brink of a devastating war. The only hope lies with Captain Harlock, a noble space pirate, and his crew aboard the Arcadia. Along with Esmeralda, Tochiro, and Tadeshi, Harlock must restore the gold to its rightful heirs before humanity is caught in the crossfire and destroyed forever!",
