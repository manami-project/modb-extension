    "text": "When the mythical gold of Rhein is stolen by Alberich, an ancient being seeking to restore his extinct race's power, the universe plunges towards chaos. The theft awakens long-dormant gods demanding vengeance, threatening all humanity in the process. To avert catastrophe, the brave crew of the space pirate ship Arcadia embarks on a crucial mission to retrieve the pilfered treasure. Led by the notorious Captain Harlock and aided by the young Tadashi Daiba, this ragtag team races to return the gold to its rightful owners - the heirs of the original Rhein. Failure would ignite a devastating war engulfing every corner of existence. Harlock and his band stand as humanity's final bulwark against annihilation. But they cannot triumph alone. To save humankind, they must first outwit Alberich, unlock the secrets of the mythical gold, and appease the wrathful gods - a truly herculean task. Yet if any are up to the challenge, it is Harlock and his intrepid pirates aboard the Arcadia!",
