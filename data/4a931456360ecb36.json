The organization remains divided on whether his powers will be a force for good or evil, leaving the ultimate decision in Shen La's hands.\n\nBased on the novel of the same name by Er Dong Shui Shou, this anime follows Shen La and Sun Desheng as they navigate the treacherous waters of the supernatural world, ultimately shaping their destinies and the fate of the bureau.",
