  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Due to an unexpected alien spaceship crash in Tokyo Bay a year ago, Japan has welcomed a new group of residents known as DearS, an alien race predominantly composed of females. Despite the nation's fascination with these extraterrestrial beings, high school student Takeya Ikuhara maintains a skeptical view of them. However, his ordinary life takes a turn when he stumbles upon a mysterious and helpless DearS girl named Ren, shivering and lost on the side of the road.\n\nIn an act of compassion, Takeya offers her shelter, unaware that this simple gesture would initiate a master-slave bond between them. As Ren's designated \"Master,\" Takeya becomes responsible for teaching her about human culture and customs. Ren, in return, remains devoted to serving and pleasing Takeya, much to his discomfort.\n\nAs Takeya and Ren navigate their newfound relationship, they face various challenges, including misunderstandings, embarrassing situations, and the constant fear of Ren being discovered as a malfunctioning DearS. Meanwhile, the enigmatic \"Gift\" connection begins to develop between them, leading Takeya to learn more about the DearS and their true purpose on Earth. With Ren's determination to stay by Takeya's side and her unique nature compared to other DearS, their extraordinary adventure is just beginning.",
