  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Musunde Hiraite is an ensemble high school romance that follows several students at the same school. The primary storyline centers around Hiroshi Furuya, a first-year student who immediately falls for Himari Asaki, a beautiful senior girl, on his first day of high school. Despite Hiroshi's repeated attempts to confess his feelings, Himari avoids him out of a secret fear of men. Intertwined are additional tales of high school love among their classmates. One boy tries unsuccessfully to win over his pretty upperclassman crush, having been rejected 15 times. Another student keeps detailed notes on all the girls at school, but finds himself developing real feelings when he investigates an extremely shy and quiet girl. With its shifting perspective across various student romances and focus on the triumphs and tribulations of high school love, Musunde Hiraite promises an engaging take on the academy youth story genre.",
