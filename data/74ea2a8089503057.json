  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Kanta, a lonely young boy, stumbles upon an orphaned baby deer in the forest one day, he takes it upon himself to rescue the fawn and names it Poyu. Kanta soon discovers that Poyu has a special golden tail, unlike that of a typical deer. As the two form an unlikely friendship, a new threat emerges - hunters descend upon the forest, greedily seeking Poyu's rare golden fur. With guns in hand and profits on their minds, the hunters have no regard for the lives of the creatures dwelling in the forest. As bullets fly, Kanta bravely steps forward to shield Poyu and advocate for the defenseless deer targeted by the hunters. Joined by the rest of the herd, the boy and his golden-tailed companion band together to find safety and preserve the sanctity of their woodland home in the face of human malice. Their heartwarming odyssey illuminates an important message about compassion and highlights the bittersweet relationship between man and nature.",
