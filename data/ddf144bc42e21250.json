    "text": "Try as she might to abandon her passion for baseball, Yomi Takeda's fate has other plans. During her junior high years, Yomi's signature 'Magic Throw' remained unused due to her catcher's inferior skills, resulting in an unfulfilled dream of advancing in a cross-school tournament. After transferring to Shin Koshigaya High School, a school devoid of a baseball club, Yomi unexpectedly reunites with her childhood friend, Tamaki Yamazaki.\n\nTamaki, a skilled catcher, shares Yomi's love for baseball and is one of the few who can catch her legendary 'Magic Throw.' Together, they rekindle their shared dream of excelling in baseball, which they vowed to pursue during their childhood. Alongside newfound friends and baseball enthusiasts, Yoshino and Ibuki Kawaguchi, the girls embark on a journey to revive their school's baseball team.\n\nWith renewed determination, Yomi and Tamaki's ambition extends beyond merely forming a team; they aspire to lead Shin Koshigaya's girls' baseball team to victory in the national championships. Witness the thrilling story of friendship, passion, and perseverance as these girls take on the world of baseball.",
