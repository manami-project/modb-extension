    "text": "Yukino, Kanade, and their friends receive an unexpected invitation from Sakuya to a private pool party in the middle of winter, hosted at her family's newly built indoor pool. As snow blankets the world outside, the girls find themselves in a tropical paradise, complete with bikinis and cocktails. However, Kanade's peace is short-lived as Sakuya orchestrates surprise photo shoots and impromptu editing sessions, leaving Kanade to balance her desire for a serene day with her sister and the need to thwart Sakuya's plans. Unbeknownst to the guests, Sakuya's intentions for the party are not as innocent as they seem, leading to a twist that puts Kanade's patience to the test.\n\nIn this final episode of Candy Boy, join the girls for an unforgettable day at the pool filled with laughter, surprises, and a healthy dose of sisterly love.",
