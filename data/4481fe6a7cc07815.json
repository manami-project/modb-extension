  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The final episode of the anime Candy Boy centers around an indoor pool party that Sakuya has organized for her friends before the pool opens to the public. She invites twin sisters Yukino and Kanade, as well as their friend Shizuku, to relax in bikinis and enjoy tropical drinks inside while snow falls outside. However, Sakuya has an ulterior motive - she wants to stage impromptu photoshoots of the girls and edit the photos. When Kanade discovers this, she spends much of the party trying to thwart Sakuya's photo schemes, as she desires some peaceful quality time with her sister instead. Though playful in her methods, Sakuya's true wish is simply to capture memories with her dear friends.",
