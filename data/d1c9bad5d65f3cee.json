    "text": "United by a tragic past and fueled by a thirst for vengeance, Avilio returns to the lawless town of Lawless during the Prohibition era. Once a haven for Avilio and his family, the town is now a hotbed of illicit activities, with the Vanetti mafia family ruling the streets and peddling forbidden liquor. After receiving a cryptic letter, Avilio embarks on a perilous journey to avenge his family's brutal murder at the hands of the Vanettis. Infiltrating their ranks, he forges a bond with the don's son, Nero, setting in motion a chain of events that will forever alter the fate of these men. As the line between revenge and redemption blurs, the 91-day saga unfolds, leaving one to ponder: will vengeance bring solace or only ignite a never-ending cycle of retribution?",
