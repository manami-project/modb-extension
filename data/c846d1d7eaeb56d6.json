  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Feature d in this anime is the legendary Monkey King, Wukong, who rebels against the divine rule of the Jade Emperor, leading to an epic confrontation with the formidable Er Lang Shen, the emperor's nephew. The story is inspired by the opening chapters of the timeless fantasy novel, Journey to the West. Wukong's mischievous antics in the royal mansion land him the responsibility of managing the Peach Orchard, but his destructive behavior continues, culminating in the theft of the coveted Golden Elixir. Mother Queen retaliates by dispatching Heavenly King Lee and an army of 100,000 heavenly soldiers, only to witness their defeat at Wukong's hands. The mighty God Erlang is then summoned, resulting in a grueling battle that spans three hundred rounds and ultimately leads to Wukong's capture. However, the Golden Elixir grants Wukong invincibility, forcing the desperate Jade Emperor to seek assistance from the omnipotent Rulai Buddha. This captivating anime combines puppet live-action with animated 3D backgrounds and characters, offering a unique visual experience that earned it a nomination for Best Animated Feature Film at the 1st Asia Pacific Screen Awards.",
