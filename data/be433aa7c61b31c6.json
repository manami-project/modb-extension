  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hakubo tells the story of two high school students living in Iwaki, Fukushima following the devastating Tohoku earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Sachi Koyama is a diligent violinist who continues to practice daily, striving to perform at her school's upcoming cultural festival despite the hardships she and her family have endured. Yuusuke Kijinami fled to Iwaki after his hometown was rendered uninhabitable by the disaster. Haunted by the impermanence of life, Yuusuke tries to capture the fleeting beauty around him through his artwork for his school's exhibition. When Sachi and Yuusuke have a chance encounter while Yuusuke is searching for scenic vistas to paint, they begin to open up to each other about their creative passions which give their lives meaning in the aftermath of tragedy. As they meet up repeatedly to appreciate sunsets together, the two develop a heartfelt bond over their shared experiences and appreciation for living in the present. Though initially awkward with each other and focused on their individual goals, by supporting each other's artistic aspirations, Sachi and Yuusuke find inspiration and solace. Their budding romance represents the possibility of hope and human connection emerging even out of disaster.",
