    "text": "Christmas is approaching, and Retsuko, an overworked red panda, finds herself in a relentless pursuit for social media validation. To alleviate the stress from her demanding job, she once sought solace in death metal karaoke, but now, she's discovered a new outlet: Instagram. With the help of her colleague Tsunoda, Retsuko learns to craft the perfect photo, going to great lengths to capture the most likable moments. As her obsession with online approval intensifies, she concocts a grand plan for Christmas Eve: a picture-perfect date to dazzle her followers. But as the festive season draws nearer, Retsuko's quest for the ultimate post hits a snag â€“ she's yet to find a date.
