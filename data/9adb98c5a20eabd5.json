    "text": "One day, Conan Edogawa, while nursing a cold, receives a call from Ai Haibara, who offers him a chance to try the latest antidote for APTX 4869, the drug responsible for turning him into a child. Excited to return to his original form as Shinichi Kudo, Conan accepts the offer. However, upon transformation, he realizes that he's been catapulted ten years into the future. In this new timeline, Conan and Ai have not taken the antidote and have grown up alongside their friends Genta, Mitsuhiko, and Ayumi, continuing their detective adventures. As Conan grapples with the shock of his new reality, he learns that he has not defeated the Black Organization and is still Conan, now a 17-year-old. The revelation that Ran has accepted Araide-sensei's proposal propels him to find her and reveal the truth.",
