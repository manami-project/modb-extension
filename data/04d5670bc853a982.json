    "text": "Sakuyo's best friend, 15-year-old Saki Uno, is a rookie idol who finds herself inexplicably drawn to Sakuyo's famous idol brother, Mohiro Mikage. As she navigates the challenging world of idol stardom, Saki's life takes an unexpected turn when she crosses paths with a menacing Yakuza member. This intimidating figure reveals that her mother was once a powerful Magical Girl, and that he was her loyal animal mascot.\n\nWhen Mohiro is kidnapped by peculiar demons resembling muscular men with adorable squirrel heads, Saki resolves to do whatever it takes to save him. She forms an alliance with the Yakuza and transforms into a Magical Girl herself, only to discover that she takes on the form of a dashing man in a girl's outfit. As if this weren't complicated enough, Mohiro finds himself attracted to Saki's male form.\n\nMeanwhile, Sakuyo harbors feelings for Saki and becomes a Magical Cross-dressing Guy to protect her. With this revelation, their manager, a self-proclaimed Magical Girl enthusiast, seizes the opportunity to create a unique idol unit. As they confront the various challenges and surprises that await them, Saki and Sakuyo must navigate the complexities of love, friendship, and their newfound roles as magical protectors.",
