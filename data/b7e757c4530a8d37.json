  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kaori Makimura's heart beats no more in her own chest, but finds a new home in the body of a young Taiwanese assassin known only as 'Glass Heart'. This elite killer, raised to be a heartless machine, takes her own life by leaping from a building, only to be saved by a transplant that gives her a second chance. As she recovers, strange dreams begin to haunt her, dreams that lead her to seek out the previous owner of her new heart.\n\nIn a world parallel to the events of 'City Hunter', Glass Heart finds herself inexplicably connected to the spirit of Kaori. Driven by a desire to understand these strange visions, she embarks on a journey to Japan, where she crosses paths with Ryo Saeba, Kaori's former partner. Despite his lecherous demeanor, Ryo may hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of her dreams and offer her a new purpose in life.\n\nAs she navigates the dangerous underworld of Japan, Glass Heart finds herself inheriting not only Kaori's heart but also her memories, her home, and even her penchant for violence when provoked. Together with Ryo, they become entangled in a mafia-like conspiracy, as Glass Heart struggles to reconcile her past as a ruthless assassin with her newfound connection to Kaori and the strange, new world she now inhabits.",
