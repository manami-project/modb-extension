    "text": "At the tender age of six, Chieri, a young girl with a vivid imagination, discovers a discarded stuffed animal, Cherry, in the depths of her home during a dark period of her life. As her father's passing leaves her feeling isolated and overwhelmed, Cherry becomes her steadfast companion and a beacon of comfort.\n\nAs Chieri grows older, her bond with Cherry remains unbroken, even when faced with ridicule from her cousins at her grandmother's memorial service. Seeking solace, Chieri stumbles upon a magical realm filled with enchanting creatures, including a pregnant dog on the brink of giving birth. However, this whimsical world is not without its dangers, as sinister forces lurk in the shadows.\n\nWhen the life of the newborn puppy hangs in the balance, Chieri and Cherry must confront these dark forces head-on, leading to a climactic battle that demands a heart-wrenching sacrifice. As Chieri navigates the delicate boundary between fantasy and reality, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and growth.",
