    "text": "Judy Abbott is an orphan living at the John Grier Orphanage who receives a life-changing opportunity - a full scholarship to attend the prestigious Lincoln Memorial Girls' School. This scholarship is provided by an anonymous benefactor that Judy refers to as \"Daddy Long Legs\" after seeing his tall shadow. As Judy begins her new adventure at the school, she promises her mysterious sponsor that she will write to him every month to chronicle her experiences. At Lincoln, Judy befriends fellow students like the wealthy Julia Pendleton and her good friend Sally McBride. With her bright spirit and open heart, Judy embraces all the new lessons and friendships that come with her new home. This hopeful coming-of-age story follows Judy's journey as she steps out of the orphanage and into a future full of possibility, enabled by the kindness of a stranger. As Judy writes to Daddy Long Legs, detailing her growth at Lincoln, a unique bond forms between them even across the distance.",
