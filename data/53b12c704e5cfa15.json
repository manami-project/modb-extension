  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Bow is a homeless bull terrier living a carefree life as a stray dog. With a distinctive black circle around one eye and an exceptionally goofy demeanor, Bow drools when hungry, wags his tail when happy, and barks when excited - displaying behavior just like an ordinary dog, albeit in an especially messy and foolish fashion. Bow's dumb innocence often leads to chaotic mishaps and disasters. Yet despite his ugly appearance and lack of intelligence, people can't help but be charmed by him. After being adopted by the young daughter of an unimpressive yakuza family, Bow turns their orderly home upside down with his silly antics. The gangster father struggles to discipline Bow, now his beloved little girl's pet. At the same time, Bow builds meaningful relationships with groups including local schoolchildren and a lonely cartoonist. Through the absurdity and humor of this bull terrier's life, the story provides lighthearted comedy sure to delight viewers of all ages.",
