  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Koko Hekmatyar is a young, idealistic arms dealer selling weapons illegally across the globe. Though her work skirts international law, she pursues the greater purpose of someday realizing world peace. Koko heads the shipping company HCLI as a front for her arms dealing. Her team of bodyguards, composed of former special ops soldiers, protects her on dangerous missions to war-torn regions. The crew's latest addition is Jonah, a child soldier whose family was killed by arms dealers. Though he despises weapons, Jonah joins to find those responsible for his familyâ€™s death. With Jonah and her hardened soldiers at her side, Koko fearlessly travels into the darkest corners of the arms trade, staying one step ahead of the CIA and assassins. From conflict zones to the black market, this team transports arms to clients engaged in violence while somehow keeping their hopeful belief that peace is possible.",
