    "text": "Sana is one of a group of gifted girls with the extraordinary ability to turn imagination into reality, known as \"Alice's Dream.\" Having escaped from a secret research facility where she was detained and experimented on, Sana encounters Zouroku, a stubborn, elderly florist who values order and justice. Though initially dismissive, Zouroku's sense of right and wrong compels him to shield Sana from her pursuers. In spite of their vastly different personalities, the pair begin an unlikely cohabitation, neither anticipating just how much their lives will be disrupted by Sana's incredible power. Together, they navigate the fantastical chaos brought on by \"Alice's Dream,\" and learn the true meaning of family along the way.",
