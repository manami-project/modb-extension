    "text": "Although the film Deep Sea follows the trend of original animated features, it distinguishes itself by immersing viewers in a breathtaking underwater universe, unlike anything they have seen before. Directed by Tian Xiaopeng, this 3D animation marks a significant milestone for October Media. The story revolves around a young girl's extraordinary journey as she navigates through the enigmatic depths of the ocean, filled with colossal whirlpools and peculiar marine life.\n\nThe captivating poster hints at the wonders and dangers that lurk beneath the surface, showcasing striking images of enormous maelstroms, bizarre fish, and haunting eyes peering from the vortex. The girl's resolute stance as she dives headfirst into the whirlpool embodies the film's tagline, \"Where the heart goes is deeper than the sea.\" With its unique blend of modern and oriental aesthetics, Deep Sea promises to deliver a visually stunning and emotionally engaging experience that pushes the boundaries of Chinese animation.",
