    "text": "In a future where large-scale disasters and widening inequality are commonplace, two cybernetically enhanced girls - the cheerful Nanakorobi Nene and the grumpy Clarion - cross paths on the high-tech island metropolis of Cenancle. Though they seem an unlikely pair, their meeting becomes intertwined with the fate of the city when a dangerous terrorist threatens Cenancle. Nene has come to Cenancle to live with her aunt and make a fresh start, unaware of the adventures that await her. A chance encounter introduces her to the super-rich inventor Uzal Delilah and Clarion, Uzal's cyborg companion. Nene is excited to find a friend who is also cybernetically enhanced, but Uzal and Clarion guard intriguing secrets about Cenancle's true nature. When disaster looms, Uzal informs Nene that the only hope is for her and Clarion to combine their hidden powers - abilities Nene never suspected she possessed. Thrust into an unlikely partnership, Nene and Clarion must rise to the challenge and become heroes for the city they now call home. Their blossoming friendship could determine the fate of Cenancle's inhabitants and the future of human-cyborg relations. On this high-tech island, the divide between safety and catastrophe rests on the shoulders of these two cybernetic girls.",
