  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Guided by a peculiar curse, Junpei Kousaka, a cat-allergic high school student, finds himself in an unexpected predicament. After accidentally damaging a statue of a cat deity, Junpei gains the ability to understand cats, much to his chagrin. To break this curse, he must perform one hundred acts of kindness for these furry creatures, or else he will transform into a cat himself â€“ a fate that could be deadly given his allergies. As he navigates through the whims and wishes of various cats, Junpei must also deal with the cat-loving people in his life, including his family, his estranged childhood friend, and his crush Kaede Mizuno. With his grumpy cat Nyamsus as his guide, Junpei embarks on a journey filled with feline antics and personal growth, all while trying to keep his curse a secret.",
