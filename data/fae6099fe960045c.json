  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rei'Junior' Fujisaki, a middle-school hikikomori with a passion for games, shares his apartment with two feline companions, Shito and Zero. Shito, a charming white cat, and Zero, a sleek black cat, reside cozily under a kotatsu in their Tokyo neighborhood. The cats have a lively social circle, including a pink dog named Hana, and embark on delightful escapades together.\n\nInspired by a 2006 Japanese live-action science-fiction/fantasy romance film, Kotatsu Neko weaves a tale of unspoken affection. Both Junior and Shito harbor secret, unrequited love. Junior yearns for a classmate but lacks the courage to express his feelings. Similarly, Shito nurtures a one-sided love, adding a layer of poignancy to their everyday adventures. This heartwarming anime explores the intricacies of love, friendship, and the everyday lives of its endearing characters.",
