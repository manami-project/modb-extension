However, their plans are complicated by a mysterious stalker and Sae's unusual dreams.\n\nAs the club members grapple with their unpredictable magic, they discover a ghostly figure lurking within the tree's branches. Who is this silent observer, and what connection does he have with the alien 'Bell'?
