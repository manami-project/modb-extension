    "text": "Itsuki Iba suddenly finds himself in charge of his father's magician dispatch company, Astral, after his father mysteriously disappears. Though Itsuki has no magical abilities himself, he now leads a diverse team of magical employees including demon summoners, spirit mediums, ritual mages, and more. Initially reluctant to take on this leadership role, Itsuki aims to prove himself by managing the team effectively as they take on supernatural jobs and compete against rival companies. However, threats emerge as there are those who wish to take down Astral. Itsuki also harbors a secret power behind his eyepatch, stemming from a childhood incident. While juggling school and his new responsibilities, he discovers there is more to both the company and himself than meets the eye. Itsuki must learn to step up as a leader while uncovering the truth behind his father's disappearance if Astral is to survive.",
