    "text": "One man stands between the delicate balance of magic and science in a world where both coexist, but at a steep cost. Introducing Rayotte Steinberg, a rogue 'tactical sorcerist' who battles the grotesque monsters birthed from the overuse of forbidden magic. Clad in a restrictive 'mold' that serves as his only safeguard against the same fate, he wields a powerful staff that explodes anything in its path. Each casting of magic brings him closer to the edge, yet failure to do so spells certain death. As he navigates through brutal encounters, he must confront a haunting past that refuses to stay buried. Joining forces with the enigmatic Kapel Theta, they embark on a perilous journey to eradicate demonkind... for a price. In this thrilling anime, witness the relentless pursuit of a lone wolf sorcerer teetering on the brink of madness in a world polluted by unseen forces.",
