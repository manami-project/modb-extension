    "text": "Grancrest, a land perpetually ravaged by chaos, finds its inhabitants living in fear of impending disaster. The Lords, wielders of powerful 'Crests,' once pledged to protect the people by suppressing the chaos. However, a thirst for power has led them to abandon their vows, engaging in ruthless battles to seize each other's Crests and assert dominance. Amidst this turmoil, Siluca, a solitary mage with a deep disdain for the Lords, and Theo, a wandering knight with dreams of liberating his oppressed homeland, find themselves bound by a mutual oath. Inspired by Theo's noble aspirations, Siluca employs her persuasive tactics to form a contract with him. Together, they embark on a perilous journey to restore peace and reform their war-torn land. As the epic saga of war and fantasy unfolds around the crystal of order, Grancrest, the duo's unwavering determination and shared vision offer a glimmer of hope in a world consumed by chaos.",
