    "text": "During the tumultuous Tang dynasty, young Li Haobai and his friend Hu Jian set off from Bashu to join the military forces fighting against demonic monsters that are terrorizing the land. However, their journey takes an unexpected turn when Li Haobai accidentally fuses with the guardian spirit of the dragon veins while battling a monster. Imbued with draconic powers, Li Haobai becomes embroiled in the machinations of powerful factions vying for control and influence. The Taoist Xun Guoshi misleads the Emperor in Chang'an about achieving immortality, while ruthlessly capturing dragon spirits. The mysterious Free Spirit roams Chengdu, eliminating demons. And Li Haobai must evade constant pursuit from those coveting the Lixi Pearl fused within him, which allows control over the dragon veins. With the help of new allies, including a wandering girl from the West named Ahimu, Li Haobai quests to return the Lixi Pearl to the dragon veins before catastrophic upheaval ensues. But mysterious forces still hunt him at every turn, intent on harnessing the pearl's incredible power for their own ends. Li Haobai must navigate friends and foes alike on his journey eastwards, while striving to understand the burgeoning abilities granted by his draconic transformation.",
