    "text": "Mizuru Mido and her assistant, Fuu Sagami, find themselves in a desperate battle against alien lifeforms known as 'Kikou' in a parallel world that mirrors modern Japan. These extraterrestrial beings first appeared in 2025, causing widespread destruction and leaving humanity in ruins. To combat this threat, the Tokyo Kikou Institute was established to research the Kikou's weaponry, ultimately leading to the creation of the Muttsu â€“ a mecha made from the remains of an enemy.\n\nAs Mizuru and Fuu bravely pilot the Muttsu in hopes of turning the tide against the Kikou, they face a mysterious side effect: the pilot suffers from memory loss after each battle. Now, they must not only fight for humanity's survival but also unravel the enigma behind this strange affliction. As they delve deeper into the mystery, a cruel fate looms over the duo, testing their resolve and the future of mankind. This captivating tale, born from a winning smartphone novel, promises a thrilling and emotional journey.",
