  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the continent of Spooner, sorcerers make up the aristocracy and have begun abusing their magical powers. To stop these evildoers from oppressing the weak, a team called the Sorcerer Hunters takes action. The Hunters work under the direction of Big Mama. The team includes: Carrot, who morphs into a giant monster when spelled; Gateau, a muscular bodybuilder; Marron, a mage; and Chocolate and Tira, sisters able to transform at will into dominatrices. Together, they confront the rogue sorcerers through a mix of combat, seduction and negotiation. However, the Hunters face their biggest challenge yet when the ancient wizard Zaha Torte emerges. He aims to unleash a destructive god that lies dormant inside one member of the Hunters team. With the fate of the world at stake, the Sorcerer Hunters must prevent Zaha from succeeding in his catastrophic goal.",
