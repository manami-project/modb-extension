  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Big Mama and her motley crew of Sorcerer Hunters are the last line of defense against the tyranny of magic users on the continent of Spooner. Carrot, a hunter with a peculiar transformation under magic spells, Gateau, a muscular powerhouse, Marron, a skilled mage, and the enigmatic duo Chocolate and Tira, who can assume dominatrix forms at will, embark on a series of adventures to protect the weak from the corrupt sorcerers. As they face these challenges, they remain largely clueless about the grand scheme of things, with perhaps the exception of Marron.\n\nBut when an ancient wizard, Zahha Torte, sets his sights on world domination by awakening the God of Destruction residing within one of the Hunters, the tables turn, and the hunters become the hunted. From local virgin kidnappings to mysterious soul-sucking entities, no job is too bizarre for this eclectic group. Brace yourself for a thrilling, titillating, and often bewildering journey in the world of Sorcerer Hunters!",
