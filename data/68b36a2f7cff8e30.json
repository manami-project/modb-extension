  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Realizing the harsh realities of a future where the earth's surface is uninhabitable due to intense radiation from the sun and abandoned nuclear plants, two special police officers find themselves on a mission that transcends their duty. In the aftermath of a raid on a religious cult's stronghold, they stumble upon a barely alive winged mutant girl, bound in chains.\n\nBefore they can react, government scientists clad in hazmat suits swoop in, whisking her away to a research facility. The officers realize that the girl has merely been moved from one captivity to another. Driven by a sense of justice, they devise a daring plan to set her free.\n\nThis thrilling narrative unfolds in the music video for \"On Your Mark\" by Chage & Aska, directed by the legendary Hayao Miyazaki. The two police officers, modeled after the pop duo, embark on a dangerous rescue mission, pitting themselves against the might of the government to save the winged girl.",
