  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tooru Amuro, a Public Security Bureau officer, is on a relentless hunt for the criminal responsible for the death of his colleague three years ago. Meanwhile, Miwako Sato, a Metropolitan Police Department detective, is preparing for her wedding at Shibuya Hikarie on Halloween. However, the joyous occasion is abruptly interrupted when an intruder storms in, resulting in Wataru Takagi being injured while shielding Miwako. This incident triggers painful memories for Miwako, reminding her of the bombings that claimed the life of her first love, Jinpei Matsuda, three years prior. As fate would have it, the perpetrator behind those bombings has just escaped from prison.\n\nAs the situation unfolds, Amuro finds himself targeted by a mysterious figure who attaches a collar bomb to him. In response, Conan Edogawa steps in to help, visiting an underground shelter to defuse the bomb. Amuro reveals to Conan a chilling encounter from three years ago, when he and his fellow Police Academy members crossed paths with an unidentified virtual bomber known as 'Plamya' in Shibuya. As Conan and his team delve deeper into the investigation, an ominous presence begins to close in on them. With time running out, Conan must act swiftly to solve the case and protect those around him.",
