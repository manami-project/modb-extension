  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It has been six years since Taichi Yagami and his friends traveled to the Digital World. In that time, the gate between the two worlds mysteriously closed. Now high schoolers, the former DigiDestined have moved on with their lives, though Taichi remains unsure of his path. When a savage insectoid Digimon called Kuwagamon appears in Odaiba, it wrecks havoc and disrupts electronics across the city. Taichi impulsively chases after it alone, only to find himself cornered. As Kuwagamon attacks, Taichi's Digivice glows and his partner Agumon emerges to defeat the rampaging Digimon. Taichi wonders why Digimon are able to cross over to the human world and what new threat endangers both worlds. The appearance of his classmate Meiko Mochizuki seems connected to the deepening digital crisis. Though years have passed, Taichi and his friends may need to take up their roles as DigiDestined once more to face this new evil.",
