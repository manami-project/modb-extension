    "text": "Selectors return for another season of the high-stakes card game, WIXOSS, where special cards known as LRIGs hold the power to grant wishes. Ruko, a young player, finds herself once again entangled in the game's mysterious world. As she battles alongside her LRIG, she discovers the dark consequences of losing and the potential ruin it can bring to her cherished life.\n\nWhile Ruko and her friends, Yuzuki and Hitoe, hesitate to engage in the dangerous game, another Selector, Chiyori, remains oblivious to the potential consequences. As Ruko tries to dissuade Chiyori from her perilous path, she uncovers secrets about a WIXOSS novel that may hold the key to understanding the LRIGs and the very existence of the Selector battles.\n\nMeanwhile, Akira, a model whose career has been revived thanks to Iona, now possessed by Ulith, pledges her allegiance to Ulith. Unbeknownst to Akira, Ulith is plotting to use a familiar LRIG to torment Ruko and prevent her wish from ever being granted.\n\nDetermined to uncover the truth behind WIXOSS and save the LRIGs, Ruko embarks on a quest filled with shocking revelations and intense battles. Will she be able to set the LRIGs free and confront the game's malicious creator? The fate of the LRIGs hangs in the balance as Ruko delves deeper into the world of WIXOSS.",
