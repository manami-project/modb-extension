  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On Christmas Eve, Hiro Hirono has a fateful encounter with Miyako Miyamura, a vivacious girl who borrows his bicycle to chase a thief. This chance meeting leads them to realize they attend the same high school, allowing their budding relationship to develop further. However, their deepening bond elicits jealousy from Hiro’s childhood friend, Kei Shindou, who has long harbored feelings for him. As Kei competes for Hiro’s attention, her radiant personality also captures the interest of Kyosuke Tsutsumi, an aspiring photographer seeking his next muse. Elsewhere, Renji Asou meets the demure Chihiro Shindou, Kei’s twin sister, at an abandoned train station. Though shy at first, a tender friendship grows as they discover a shared love of literature. However, Renji soon learns of Chihiro’s debilitating disability - a peculiar amnesia causing her memories to reset every 13 hours. Moved by her dream of writing a novel, Renji dedicates himself to making this dream a reality, despite the formidable obstacles of her condition. As these youths’ interwoven relationships develop, their histories begin to emerge in emotional revelations of love, heartbreak, acceptance and cherished memories. Though the future remains uncertain, their paths are guided by compassion and the resilience of the human spirit.",
