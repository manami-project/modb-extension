  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This 25-minute silent anime film depicts behind-the-scenes stories surrounding the production of the 1938 film \"Nezumikozo Jirokichi - Edo Chapter,\" directed by acclaimed but short-lived filmmaker Sadao Yamanaka. It focuses on Yamanaka's efforts to transition Japanese cinema from silent films to talkies with this particular film. \"Nezumikozo Jirokichi - Edo Chapter\" tells the story of the title character, a heroic thief in Edo-era Japan who steals from the wealthy and gives to the poor. Other main characters include Suzu, a struggling widow; Bonji, Yasugoro, and Chogoro, who aim to expose the identity of Nezumikozo Jirokichi; and Kanâ€™emon, a detective who respects righteousness. Through their stories, Yamanaka hoped to showcase the drama and intrigue unfolding in old Edo's streets. This silent anime film pays tribute to Yamanaka's creative ambitions and pivotal role spurring the film industry's shift to talkies before his early death at age 28. Capturing the spirit behind \"Nezumikozo Jirokichi - Edo Chapter,\" it promises to provide a window into a dynamic period of Japanese cinematic history.",
