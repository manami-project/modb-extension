    "text": "Nezumi Kozō Jirokichi - Edo no Maki: A Silent Tribute to a Visionary Filmmaker\n\nIn the heart of Edo, under the cover of darkness, a mysterious figure stirs in the attic. This is Nezumi Kozō Jirokichi, a chivalrous thief who steals from the rich to give to the poor. The tale of this noble thief unfolds in a human drama filled with vibrant characters such as Suzu, a widowed merchant struggling to raise her child, and Bonji, Yasugoro, and Chogoro, who seek to reveal Nezumi Kozō's true identity. Among them is Kan'emon, a seasoned detective who despises sin but holds a deep affection for people.\n\nThis captivating story is the brainchild of Sadao Yamanaka, a visionary film director who tragically passed away at the age of 28 in 1938. Yamanaka's work played a pivotal role in the Japanese film industry's shift from silent films to talkies, and his film Nezumikozō Jirokichi - Edo no Maki (Nezumikozo Jirokichi - Edo Chapter) is no exception.\n\nThis 25-minute silent anime film offers a rare glimpse into the behind-the-scenes story of Yamanaka's production efforts, paying homage to the director's unwavering dedication to his craft. Immerse yourself in this poignant tribute to a remarkable filmmaker and his timeless creation.",
