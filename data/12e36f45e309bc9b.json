    "text": "Home page: [500,000,000-nen Button Official Home Page](https://500million-nen.com/)\n\nIn a world where a single button holds the power to grant a million yen, there's a catch - the button's presser must endure 500 million years of solitude in a barren space. Yet, upon completion of this time, their memory is wiped clean, and they return to the moment before pressing the button. For Tonio, Jaibi, and Suneko, three siblings desperate for money to cover their father's hospital bills, the appearance of this button presents a challenging decision. This new anime adaptation of the beloved '500 Million Year Button' story from the Minna no Tonio-chan series promises a thought-provoking and emotional journey.",
