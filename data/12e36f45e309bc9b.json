    "text": "Three siblings - 5-year-old Tonio, 14-year-old Jaibi, and 17-year old Suneko - face a dire situation when their father is hospitalized and needs treatment they cannot afford. Then, an opportunity arises when a mysterious person appears with a special button that can give them the money they need. This \"500 Million Year Button\" offers a trade-off: press it to receive one million yen instantly, but the person must spend 500 million years alone in an empty space. When the time ends, their memory of that experience will be completely erased. Faced with their father's illness and no other options, the three siblings must grapple with an impossible question - is pressing this mysterious button worth the unimaginable solitude they will endure in exchange for the money to treat their father? This profound choice forms the crux of the story depicted in this anime adapted from the classic \"500 Million Year Button\" tale. By having to weigh present desperation against timeless isolation, the anime promises to explore the depths of human choice through speculative fiction. Will the siblings press the button? The answer promises high drama focused on moral struggle.",
