  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Specter, a cunning monkey, has orchestrated a daring escape from a circus, harnessing the power of a mind-controlling device that has not only boosted his intelligence but also granted him command over other monkeys in the vicinity. To thwart this simian uprising, a professor enlists the help of Kakeru, tasking him with the mission to apprehend all the monkeys under Specter's influence, with the ultimate goal of capturing the mastermind himself.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kakeru, his visit to the professor's residence marks the beginning of an extraordinary adventure. The monkeys have discovered the power of pipo helmets, a device that amplifies their fighting capabilities by an astonishing 300 times, posing a significant threat to human dominance. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Kakeru embarks on a thrilling quest through the professor's dimensional transport machine to capture the pipo-wielding monkeys and foil Specter's sinister plan for world domination.",
