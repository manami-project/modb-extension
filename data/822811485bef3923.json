  "synopsis": {
    "text": "For ced by overpopulation, humanity in Universal Century 0079 has expanded into space, establishing large, cylindrical colonies known as Sides, governed by the Earth Federation Space Force. Amidst these colonies, Side 3, nestled near the moon's dark side, declares independence, becoming the Principality of Zeon and sparking a relentless war.\n\nIn a desperate bid to counter Zeon's formidable mobile suits, the Federation unveils its new weapon: the powerful Gundam, housed within the White Base. When a Zeon attack inadvertently thrusts teenage civilian Amuro Ray into the Gundam's cockpit, he finds himself at the heart of the conflict, alongside other young pilots.\n\nAs the war intensifies, Amuro and his comrades aboard the White Base must navigate the brutal realities of warfare and uncover their inner strength to protect their home and the future of the Federation. The fate of the universe hangs in the balance, as Amuro's journey of self-discovery unfolds amidst the chaos of war.",
