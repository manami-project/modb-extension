    "text": "After a decade abroad, Azuma Ikki's homecoming to Japan is far from warm. Instead, he is ambushed by a group of menacing armed men and held captive. His salvation comes in the form of Kogane Asabuki, a childhood friend wielding a unique weapon known as Bubuki, a sentient entity attached to her right hand. Upon discovering his own ability to command Bubuki, Azuma embarks on a mission. Joined by his newfound allies, he seeks to awaken Oumai, a colossal Buranki (titan) slumbering beneath the earth's surface, setting the stage for an epic adventure.",
