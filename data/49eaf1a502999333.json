    "text": "Mari Tamaki is a high school student entering her second year, filled with aspirations to make the most of her youth, but struggling with self-doubt and hesitation holding her back. That changes when she encounters Shirase Kobuchizawa, a girl determined to travel to Antarctica to search for her missing mother. Despite facing ridicule over her ambitious dream, Shirase remains resolute. Inspired by her tenacity, Mari joins Shirase's planned expedition. They are soon joined by the eccentric Hinata Miyake, eager for adventure, and graceful Yuzuki Shiraishi, seeking meaning beyond her privileged life. United by restless hearts, the four very different but spirited girls embark on a voyage traversing the farthest reaches toward the frozen unknown. There, at the edge of the world, they hope to discover incredible sights beyond their imagination, confront their deepest fears and insecurities, and uncover pieces of themselves they never knew were missing. It is the story of a grand ambition fueled by friendship, wonder, and the courage to chase their individual dreams to a place further than the universe.",
