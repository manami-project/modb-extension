  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Summer break has arrived at the prestigious Lillian Girls' Academy, bringing both respite and tension for students Yumi and Sachiko. The two young women retreat to the Ogasawara family's countryside estate, hoping for a peaceful getaway to strengthen their \"soeurs\" bond. \n\nHowever, their plans go awry when some of Sachiko's wealthy former acquaintances impose themselves on the vacation. These haughty girls view Yumi as unworthy of Sachiko's companionship and scheme to undermine their relationship. Though hurt, Yumi resolves not to let the cruelty of these debutantes ruin her treasured time with Sachiko.\n\nBack at Lillian after break, Yumi and the student council hatch a plot to gently prod the stubborn Sachiko into participating as a judge at nearby Hanadera Boys' Academy's school festival. Ever reluctant to interact with males, Sachiko requires delicate persuasion.\n\nAs the trimester continues, Yumi contends with meddling nuisances and deepens her connection to Sachiko through shared trials. She draws strength from friends in the charmingly-named \"Mountain Lily Council\" and support from her own brother who attends Hanadera. With patience and compassion, the bonds between the young women continue to grow.",
