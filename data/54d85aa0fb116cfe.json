    "text": "Noel grew up idolizing his legendary adventurer grandfather and aspired to follow in his footsteps as a powerful Seeker. However, despite his ambition, Noel disappointingly discovers that he is a Talker - a support class with minimal battle abilities. Though initially dismayed, Noel refuses to give up on his dream. Armed with intelligence and resourcefulness, he sets out to prove that even a Talker can make a name for himself. Noel decides that if he lacks personal strength, he will amass power by uniting others. Leveraging his clever wit and silver tongue, he works to assemble the greatest clan in the land, bringing together mighty heroes and assassins under his command. Though limited by his class, Noel pursues supremacy through strategy, resolve, and leadership. Employing ingenious tactics, he leads his followers to triumph against incredible odds. This is the story of an unlikely underdog who refuses to accept the expectations set upon him. With unrelenting drive and cunning, the notorious \"Talker\" carves his own path to glory.",
