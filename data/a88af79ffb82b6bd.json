    "text": "Alex Benedetto, a former prostitute, joins forces with the infamous 'Handymen,' Nic and Worick, in the corrupt city of Ergastulum, where both police and mafia hold sway. As mercenaries for hire, the Handymen tackle jobs that are too unsavory for even the city's morally bankrupt inhabitants. When a new gang encroaches on a powerful mafia family's turf, the duo is hired to take them down, only to discover that the job is far more complex than they initially thought.\n\nNic, a super-human Twilight with extraordinary abilities, and Worick, a smooth-talking charmer, must navigate the treacherous underworld of Ergastulum while protecting Alex from the sinister forces that seek to eradicate Twilights like Nic. As the city undergoes a dramatic shift in power, the Handymen find themselves embroiled in a looming conflict that threatens to engulf the entire city, leaving chaos in its wake. In this criminal haven, the Handymen must use their unique skills to maintain the delicate balance of power and survive against the odds.",
