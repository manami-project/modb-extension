  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tetsuwan Atom may have been the first 25-minute anime series, but before it, there was a groundbreaking anime that revolutionized television. This anime, divided into two seasons, was not the first anime ever broadcasted, but it holds the title of being the first anime series to grace the television screens.\n\nThe first season, 'Instant History,' aired in 1961, comprising 312 bite-sized episodes, each lasting a mere 3 minutes. The second season, 'Otogi Manga Calendar,' followed suit with 312 episodes, each slightly longer at 5 minutes.\n\nThe anime's unique premise revolved around a character who was oblivious to historical events. Each episode unraveled a historical event that occurred on the same day, providing a blend of education and entertainment. The creators ingeniously incorporated photographs, film footages, and animations to create an immersive viewing experience.\n\nThe director's Fuku-chan manga, printed in the Mainichi Shinbun newspaper, served as the research archives for the show. While Three Tales was the first Japanese anime to be shown on TV, and Tetsuwan Atom was the first 25-minute anime series, this anime series pioneered the way for anime on television.\n\nJoin this historical journey and witness the dawn of anime on television with this unique series.",
