  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This pioneering anime series, which debuted in 1961, offered viewers a unique glimpse into history. Divided into two seasons, it utilized a mix of animation and archival photos and footage to depict notable events and educate its main character - and by extension, the audience - on what transpired on any given date. The first season, titled \"Instant History\", spanned 312 episodes of 3 minutes each. The following season, \"Otogi Manga Calendar\", delivered another 312 installments at 5 minutes apiece. While not the outright first anime broadcast on television - that honor belongs to the 1960 special Three Tales - this show has the distinction of being the inaugural animated series to air. The premise centered around a character unaware of the historical significance tied to a particular calendar date. As he learned of major happenings that took place, whether wars won or scientific discoveries or influential figures leaving their mark, the show aimed to chronicle these moments that shaped human civilization in an enlightening yet entertaining format. Blending information from the robust archives of the Mainichi newspaper with imaginative animation, Manga Calendar brought education and art together. It paved the way for other iconic animated works to come, proving the medium's versatility in tackling any subject matter - even the richness of our collected past.",
