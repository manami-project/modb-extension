  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Day after day, the once thriving city of Neo Kyoto now lies in ruins, its citizens ruthlessly hunted by the King's loyal servants, the KUGE. The KUGE's sinister mission is to drain the magical energy from the people, using it to bolster their ruler's power. Amidst this chaos, a young girl emerges, relentlessly pursued by the KUGE - none other than the former King herself, Kurabe Kikka.\n\nOnce celebrated as the most formidable King in Neo Kyoto's history, Kikka now finds herself defenseless against the KUGE. With no Build-Divide deck at her disposal, she is left with no choice but to run, haunted by her past mistakes and consumed by regret. As despair threatens to engulf her, an unexpected ally extends a helping hand, offering Kikka a glimmer of hope.\n\nTogether, these two young women join forces, embarking on a perilous journey through the desolate remains of Neo Kyoto. Their mission: to find the one person they both hold dear. As they traverse the ruins, their bond grows stronger, and they prepare to face the challenges that lie ahead.\n\nWith the fate of Neo Kyoto hanging in the balance, their battle is about to commence - a battle that will test their courage, their resilience, and their unwavering determination to save the one they cherish.",
