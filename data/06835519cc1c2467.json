  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As per the 1981 book \"The Hundredth Monkey\" by Ken Keyes Jr., the anime \"100 Banme no Saru\" narrates a captivating tale inspired by a 1952 experiment on the southern Japanese island of Kojima. The story revolves around the concept that when one monkey learns to wash its food, it can pass on this knowledge to others. Intriguingly, once a specific number of monkeys acquire this skill, not only do the remaining monkeys on the island seem to instinctively know how to do it, but a separate group of apes on a different island also appear to gain this knowledge. Keyes employs this intriguing phenomenon as a metaphor for the antinuclear movement, suggesting that significant change can occur when enough individuals unite for a common cause.",
