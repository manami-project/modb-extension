  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on Ken Keyes Jr.'s 1981 book \"The Hundredth Monkey\", this anime explores a phenomenon observed in a 1952 experiment on a Japanese island. When one monkey learned to wash its food, it taught others this skill. Upon reaching a threshold of 100 monkeys who had acquired this ability, suddenly all the other monkeys on that island, and even monkeys on a completely separate island with no contact, mysteriously gained the knowledge of food-washing as well. Keyes uses this tale, though considered scientifically dubious, as an inspirational parable. Just as the new behavior spread rapidly once a critical mass of monkeys learned it, he suggests that grassroots movements can create dramatic societal shifts once they gain enough momentum and participants. Through an uplifting story of connection and change, the anime examines how individual actions can ripple outwards to transform communities.",
