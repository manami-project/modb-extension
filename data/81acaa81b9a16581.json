    "text": "One fateful day, Arata Kasuga, a potential Demon Lord possessing the 'demon lord element,' casually brushes against Lilith Asami's grimoire, the Hermes Apocrypha. Suddenly, a blinding light envelops him, and a mysterious girl appears before him. He names her Lilim, who immediately becomes fond of Arata and Lilith, treating them as her parents. However, her arrival coincides with a significant shift in their world - the awakening of the forbidden 'Eternal Library.' Within the library lies the pinnacle of alchemy, the White Demon Lord, a human-created entity with an insatiable desire to become the true Demon Lord. To achieve this, the White Demon Lord sets his sights on eliminating Arata and the Trinity Seven. As they face an adversary wielding unimaginable power, Arata and his companions must engage in a desperate battle to save the world from impending doom. Will Arata and the Trinity Seven emerge victorious in this final showdown?",
