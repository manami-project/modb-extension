    "text": "Arata Kasuga's life is turned upside down when he accidentally touches Lilith Asami's magical grimoire, causing a mysterious girl named Lilim to appear. Lilim becomes deeply attached to Arata and Lilith, seeing them as her parents. However, her sudden appearance has grave consequences - it awakens the legendary Eternal Library, unsealing the dangerous White Demon Lord. Created through alchemy, the White Demon Lord seeks to eliminate Arata and the powerful Trinity Seven so he can become the true Demon Lord. With reality itself now in peril, Arata joins forces with Lilith, Lilim, and the rest of the Trinity Seven in a desperate attempt to defeat the White Demon Lord before his apocalyptic plans come to fruition. Outmatched but determined, this unlikely group of heroes engage in a climactic battle where the fate of the world hangs in the balance. Can their combined powers defeat this ultimate evil, or will the White Demon Lord gain the power he craves and reign destruction down upon them all?",
