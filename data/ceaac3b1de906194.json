  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chizuru's playful flirtations and Kota's bashful reactions set the tone for a sizzling summer break, as their group of friends revel in the sun-soaked season. Amidst the warmth, Nozomu's antics add an extra layer of chaos, while the unrequited affection between Tayura and Akane unfolds in a classic dance of pursuit and rejection. Despite the changes that have occurred since the fox claimed its prize, the enduring charm of a boy-meets-girl story persists.\n\nFor the studious and somewhat prudish Kouta Oyamada, summer vacation brings a host of unexpected challenges. While Akane Asahina seeks solace in the library, the mischievous wolf-spirit Nozomu indulges in naked slumber and alfresco bathing. As Kouta struggles to maintain his focus on homework, Chizuru's provocative morning workouts and unconventional dining habits threaten to derail his plans.\n\nWhether they're foraging for food, creating unsettling video documentaries, or simply enjoying the spectacle of fireworks, the gang's summer adventures promise anything but tranquility. Amidst the laughter, the blushing, and the various states of undress, one thing is certain: this is a season none of them will forget.",
