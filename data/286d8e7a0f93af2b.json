    "text": "Altered Carbon: Resleeved takes place in the same universe as the Netflix live-action sci-fi series Altered Carbon, expanding on the show's mythology. The story follows Takeshi Kovacs, a former soldier whose consciousness has been transferred to a new body 250 years after his death. Kovacs is hired by the leader of a yakuza crime syndicate to investigate the mysterious deaths of his father and brother during a ritualistic power transition. Kovacs rescues a young tattoo artist named Holly who was targeted by rival yakuza due to her integral role in preparing for the ritual. As her bodyguard, Kovacs gets close to the syndicate's next leader, Shinji, and the current boss, Genzou, soon realizing Shinji has his own agenda and there are sinister secrets behind the ritual. Kovacs races to uncover the truth behind the unexplained deaths, protect Holly, and stop Shinji before more lives are lost. With stunning visuals and suspenseful action sequences, Altered Carbon: Resleeved provides an exciting side story expanding on the intricate futuristic world of transferring human consciousness between bodies pioneered in Altered Carbon.",
