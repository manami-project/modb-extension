    "text": "Upon discovering that her friend has been deceived by a host, high school student Hotaru Tachibana, disguised as a boy, storms into a club seeking revenge. Instead of a physical fight, she finds herself in an airsoft duel with the club's most popular host, Masamune Matsuoka. After causing significant damage to the club, Tachibana is coerced into joining Matsuoka's struggling Survival Gaming team to pay off her debt. However, Tachibana harbors a secret: she is not a boy, and she must conceal her true identity from Matsuoka and their eccentric teammate, erotic manga artist Toru Yukimura. As they compete in various survival games, Tachibana's passion for the sport grows, and the team sets their sights on winning the prestigious Top Combat Game tournament. With her gender hidden and the thrill of airsoft battles ahead, Tachibana embarks on an exhilarating journey to become Japan's top survival game player.",
