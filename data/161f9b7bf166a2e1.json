    "text": "As the curtains of the vibrant Edo period begin to close, a group of six ordinary girls, including the cheerful Yui Tsukishima, find themselves transported through time and space by the enigmatic power of mystical stones. Tasked with the noble duty of replacing the fallen celestial guardians, these young women must now embrace their new roles as protectors of humanity against the malevolent forces that threaten to engulf the world in darkness. Each girl is bestowed with a unique power, and for Yui, her weapon of choice is the power of words, capable of instilling hope and courage in the hearts of those who hear them. As they navigate this unfamiliar era, they must harness their newfound abilities and work together to thwart the sinister plans of two demonic brothers who seek to bring about humanity's downfall. Amidst the chaos and danger, a seasoned Rakugo storyteller named Utamaru Katsura takes Yui under his wing, determined to mold her into a skilled Rakugo performer, adding a touch of humor and lightheartedness to their otherwise perilous journey. Prepare for a thrilling blend of action, comedy, and heartwarming camaraderie as these brave heroines rise to the challenge and discover their true potential.",
