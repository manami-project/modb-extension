  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tsushima Maru, a freight ship, met a tragic end in July 1944 when it was torpedoed by an American submarine while transporting a group of schoolchildren back home. This heartrending historical event serves as the basis for a captivating documentary anime, adapted from the identically titled book penned by Ooshiro Tatsuhiro. The anime, a labor of love from the survivors' family members, boasts meticulous craftsmanship and a stark realism that is strikingly juxtaposed with the unusual character designs by Kiyomizu Kazutoshi. This poignant retelling not only educates viewers about a lesser-known World War II incident but also pays tribute to the lives lost during the ill-fated voyage of Tsushima Maru.",
