    "text": "While most students at Sakuradamon High steer clear of the notorious \"Mad Dog\" Seiji Sawamura and his formidable right hand, all Seiji desires is a loving girlfriend. However, his intimidating reputation has led to a string of 20 rejections, leaving him feeling hopeless and resigned to a life with only his right hand for company. In a bizarre turn of events, Seiji wakes up one morning to find his powerful hand transformed into a miniature girl named Midori Kasugano. As it turns out, Midori has harbored a secret crush on Seiji for the past three years and is now overjoyed to be close to him. As they navigate their peculiar predicament, Seiji and Midori must tackle the challenges of school, relationships, and the lingering question of how to return Midori to her original form.",
