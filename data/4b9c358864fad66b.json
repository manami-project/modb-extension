    "text": "Ayano, Yuma, and the ever-enthusiastic Eriko embark on their high school journey with a rule-breaking tour of their new all-girls school, only to discover that their preconceived notions about the institution might not be entirely accurate. Despite the unexpected revelations, the trio forms new friendships and navigates the tumultuous waters of high school life together, facing daily challenges head-on. As they stumble through adolescence, they learn valuable lessons about trust, friendship, and the importance of critical thinking - all while providing endless amusement with their questionable decision-making and penchant for public panty displays. Join these six girls as they fumble through the ups and downs of high school, leaving a trail of chaos and laughter in their wake.",
