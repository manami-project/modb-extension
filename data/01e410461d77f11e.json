    "text": "Track star Kakeru Kurahara, once a celebrated runner, now finds himself in a desperate situation, forced to steal food to survive. Serendipitously, he crosses paths with Haiji Kiyose, a fellow runner and student at Kansei University, who saves him from a tight spot. Haiji extends an invitation to Kakeru to reside at Chikusei-so, an old, rundown apartment complex. Unbeknownst to Kakeru, Haiji harbors a grand ambition: to assemble a team from the apartment's residents and participate in the prestigious Hakone Ekiden, a renowned university marathon relay race spanning over 200 kilometers between Tokyo and Hakone. However, Kakeru soon discovers that, aside from himself and Haiji, the other residents are complete beginners in the world of competitive running. With the clock ticking, can Haiji rally this motley crew to realize his dream of competing in the Hakone Ekiden?",
