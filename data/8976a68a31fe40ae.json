  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mu Yun, a once powerful fairy king, finds himself reincarnated into a despised illegitimate child after a conspiracy led to his downfall ten thousand years ago. Awakening in the renowned 'Muyun Wasteland' of the Southern Yun Empire, he encounters Miaoxianyu, a mischievous student who attempts to ensnare him in a trap. With ease, Mu Yun navigates through the trap and begins to demonstrate his exceptional alchemy skills, leaving the masters outside the door in awe. Upon returning home, he discovers that he is to be married to Qin Mengyao, a cold and distant woman who is afflicted with a fatal condition that prevents her from living past the age of 20. The marriage is a strategic move by the Qin family to secure their position, but Mu Yun agrees to it only if he can continue his pursuit of alchemy. In this new life, Mu Yun is determined to rise to the top once again and take control of the world, ready to challenge anyone who dares to stand in his way.",
