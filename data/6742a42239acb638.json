  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When you become the central character in \"One Room,\" you'll find yourself immersed in three distinct tales that unfold within the confines of your own apartment. First, you'll meet Yui Hanasaka, a newcomer to the building who seeks your guidance as she strives to gain admission to the same university you attend. Next, you'll welcome Natsuki Momohara, your younger sister, who arrives to lend a hand with your household chores. Lastly, you'll reconnect with Moka Aoshima, a childhood friend and aspiring singer, who is eager to fulfill a longstanding promise. Although these narratives appear unconnected, they share a common thread: the unseen bonds of destiny that intertwine the lives of those who cross paths within a single apartment room. This innovative anime project from SMIRAL Animation, the creators of 'Anitore' series and 'Makuranodanshi,' invites you to explore the unique connections that can emerge within the most familiar of spaces.",
