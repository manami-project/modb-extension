    "text": "This is a story of sumo, a sport that transcends the ordinary and reaches the realm of the divine. Enter Ushio Hinomaru, a new student at Odachi High School who defies the norms of the sport with his small stature. Despite his size, Hinomaru harbors a grand ambition: to reach the pinnacle of professional sumo and claim the title of Hinoshita Kaisan, equivalent to the prestigious rank of Yokozuna.\n\nJoining the school's struggling sumo club, Hinomaru and his fellow club members embark on a grueling journey to the top. In a sport where size and weight reign supreme, Hinomaru's determination and resilience challenge the status quo. The intense battle for the dream of yokozuna unfolds, as the small sumo club strives to make its mark in the high school sumo world.\n\nWith no room for retakes, this fired-up sumo tale unfolds, showcasing the raw passion and unwavering spirit of a young sumo wrestler and his club as they strive for greatness against all odds. Will Hinomaru and his team prove that size doesn't always matter in the world of sumo? Only time will tell.",
