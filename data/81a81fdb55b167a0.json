    "text": "Keyaru, a healing mage, was once subjected to unending torture and abuse, despite his incredible ability to heal any wound. His powers allowed him to absorb the memories and abilities of those he healed, making him stronger than anyone else, but by the time he reached his full potential, he had already lost everything. Desperate to change his fate, Keyaru casts a powerful spell to rewind time, vowing to use his knowledge of the past to exact revenge on those who wronged him. In a world filled with monsters, adventurers, and mage, Keyaru becomes the strongest hero, determined to right the wrongs of his past and punish those who once inflicted pain upon him. This is a dark, heroic tale of redemption and retribution, as one healing mage uses his powers to rewrite his own destiny.",
