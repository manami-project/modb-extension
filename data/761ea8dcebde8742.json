With the building swarming with the undead, Yuu, Nobu and the other students still unaffected struggle to survive and try to find a way to escape. As the friends band together in their desperate attempt to get out alive, they must use their wits, knowledge and skills to fight through the zombies and flee the school. Their bid for survival is made more complicated by the fact that anyone bitten by the zombies will soon turn into one as well. Trapped on the school roof, the likelihood of rescue seems slim. So along with planning their escape route, the girls are also forced to cherish the friendship and bonds between them, not knowing who may be lost next. Their peaceful school days now seem a distant memory in the face of the undead nightmare surrounding them. Will Yuu, Nobu and the other students manage to make it out alive or will they join the ranks of their undead former friends? Their deadly struggle for survival plays out at their once peaceful school turned chaotic zombie battleground.",
