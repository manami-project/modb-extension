    "text": "With the backdrop of Japan in 2035, an unforeseen calamity known as the 'Burst' unfolds during a scientific endeavor, unleashing an uncontrollable artificial life form dubbed 'Matter' that swiftly engulfs the Kurobe Gorge. The once-promising research city, a beacon of hope for mankind, is swiftly sealed off by the authorities, forbidding any access. Fast forward two years, Aiko Tachibana, a resilient 15-year-old who tragically lost her family in the Burst, stumbles upon an astonishing revelation from her newly-arrived classmate, Yuuya Kanzaki. Unbeknownst to her, Aiko harbors a secret within herself, and the key to deciphering this enigma lies at the epicenter of the Burst, the 'Primary Point.'\n\nDetermined to unravel the truth, Aiko, accompanied by a dedicated team of divers and guided by Yuuya, ventures into the forbidden zone. As they delve deeper into the heart of the restricted area, the duo must confront the Matter, an adversary as fluid and elusive as water, while navigating the complex web of factions vying for control. With the destiny of humanity resting in their hands, what unfathomable truth will Aiko and Yuuya unveil in their perilous quest for answers?",
