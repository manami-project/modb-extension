  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 3015, known as the Year of Dazzling, the great nations of Donatia and Kouran have plunged the world into chaos with their ongoing war for supremacy. Caught in the crossfire is Nil Kamui, a once peaceful island nation that has lost its independence after being invaded and conquered. Without autonomy or allies, the people of Nil Kamui suffer greatly under their oppressors. To make matters worse, their guardian deity the Red Dragon has gone berserk, raging across the island's villages in a fiery rampage. Hope seems lost for Nil Kamui. Yet one last ray of hope remains - Ibuki, a descendant of Nil Kamuiâ€™s royal bloodline. Though now an orphan and wanting nothing to do with conflict, Ibuki may be the nation's last chance for freedom. Reluctantly drawn into the war, Ibuki must overcome his distaste for fighting and take up the mantle of leadership to liberate his lands from those who would destroy them. Can Ibuki rise to this monumental challenge? Will the rage of the Red Dragon and greed of warring nations finally consume tiny Nil Kamui? Or can Ibuki somehow navigate this treacherous political landscape to regain his nation's sovereignty? The fate of Nil Kamui hangs in the balance.",
