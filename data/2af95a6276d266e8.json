    "text": "Abhorring conflict and desiring peace, Ibuki, a descendant of Nil Kamui's royal family, resides in an orphanage, refusing to take on the role of king. However, the world around him is tearing apart as the great nations Donatia and Kouran engage in a relentless war for supremacy. In the midst of this chaos, the island country of Nil Kamui has lost its independence, and its guardian god, the Red Dragon, has gone berserk, causing destruction and death. Despite his reluctance, Ibuki is drawn into the conflict, and the future of his country rests on his shoulders. Can Ibuki rise above his pacifist nature and save Nil Kamui from the clutches of war and the wrath of the Red Dragon? Only time will tell.",
