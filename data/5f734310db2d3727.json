    "text": "He had witnessed the construction of the pyramids, a testament to his immense age, but now the ancient crocodile found himself weakened by rheumatism, unable to hunt for sustenance. In a desperate bid for survival, he turned to a horrifying solution: consuming his own kin. This act of cannibalism, however, led to his family deciding to end his life. Feeling disrespected and betrayed, the old crocodile abandoned the Nile, embarking on a solitary journey. Along the way, he encountered an empathetic octopus who provided him with fish, nurturing a budding friendship. But as night fell, the crocodile's primal instincts took over, and he began to feast on the octopus's legs, one by one.",
