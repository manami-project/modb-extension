    "text": "Forced to come back everyday in a strange way, Tanaka and Taishou have some weird adventures in a ramen store. In the heart of Tokyo, a peculiar ramen shop is home to an even more peculiar owner and chef - a cat named Taishou. Despite his enthusiasm for running the best eatery in town, Taishou's culinary skills leave much to be desired, a fact that his most frequent customer, Tanaka-san, experiences firsthand on a daily basis. With part-time helpers such as a kleptomaniac bum, and schemes to bring in business such as serving a restaurant critic gourmet food instead of the usual fare, Taishou's ramen shop is never a dull place to patronize or work at. Despite the challenges, Taishou remains determined to turn his small ramen shop into a thriving business, one bowl at a time. Join Taishou and Tanaka as they embark on a series of bizarre and hilarious adventures in their quest to make Neko Rahmen the best ramen shop in town.",
