    "text": "Macedoniaâ€™s young King Alexander and his troops are embroiled in a fierce conflict with Persia. As the war rages on, Alexander is struck by a sudden illness, leaving him in a vulnerable state. Faced with a dilemma, Alexander must decide whether to accept help from his lifelong friend, Philip, who hails from the enemy land of Persia, or to regard him as a foe due to his nationality.\n\nThe two kings, Alexander and Philip, had been close companions since their youth, having studied together under the tutelage of the renowned scholar Aristotle. Their bond, forged through shared experiences and wisdom, had remained unbroken over the years. However, when Alexander falls ill during an eastern campaign, Philip's offer of a homemade remedy presents a challenge. Alexander, having received a clandestine letter accusing Philip of enemy collaboration, finds himself grappling with trust and suspicion.",
