    "text": "Coach Jin Munakata spots potential in Hiromi Oka, a mediocre tennis player who joined her high school's prestigious tennis club solely to be near the talented duo, Reika \"Madame Butterfly\" Ryuuzaki and Takayuki Toudou. As Munakata trains Hiromi rigorously, her dormant passion and hidden talent for tennis emerge, leading to a strong bond between them. Simultaneously, Hiromi develops a tender connection with Toudou. Despite the rocky journey, Hiromi's determination leads her to become a representative in the junior match tournament, marking her progress towards becoming a tennis champion. This anime, inspired by the success of the classic series \"Aim for the Ace,\" follows Hiromi's growth both on and off the court.",
