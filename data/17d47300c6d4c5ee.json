    "text": "Will Conan Edogawa, the renowned teenage detective, be able to solve the perplexing case of the mysterious sniper terrorizing Tokyo in \"Meitantei Conan: Ijigen no Sniper\"? The recently inaugurated Bell Tree Tower, standing tall at over 630 meters, becomes the stage for a series of baffling events. A real estate agent, Hiroaki Fujinami, is fatally shot in broad daylight, leaving the city in a state of panic. The prime suspect, Timothy Hunter, a former Navy SEAL member, is already under investigation for a previous murder. However, the case takes an unexpected turn when Timothy himself is found dead.\n\nAs the body count rises, it becomes evident that the sniper has a specific hit list, with Shuichi Akai and Masumi Sera being among the targets. Sera is shot, leaving her fate hanging in the balance, while Akai's survival remains uncertain. With the FBI involved, including agents Jodie Starling and Subaru Okiya, the stakes are high. Can Conan apprehend the elusive sniper before more lives are claimed? The race against time begins as Conan navigates through this sensitive and internationally significant case.",
