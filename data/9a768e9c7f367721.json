    "text": "Hiroya Matsumoto joins the Right Trading Company with aspirations of becoming a successful businessman like his late father. However, unbeknownst to him, he is recruited into the company's secretive Special Duty Combat Unit known as \"Shinesman\". This hilarious and eccentric team of heroes defend Earth in their spare time against invaders from Planet Voice. When duty calls, Hiroya and his coworkers trade their business suits for color-coded combat uniforms and wage war against the eccentric Prince Sasaki and his alien forces. Despite the absurdity, Shinesman takes their mission seriously - Hiroya still has meetings to attend and deadlines to meet in his civilian corporate job. With weapons ranging from salmon pink business cards to neckties that can grab enemies, Shinesman is like nothing seen before in shows like Power Rangers or Kamen Rider. Can this zany band of heroes succeed in saving their beloved company Earth from the alien threat amidst their hectic corporate lifestyles?",
