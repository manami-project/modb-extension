  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Right Trading Company's newest recruit, Hiroya Matsumoto, dreams of following in his late father's footsteps and becoming a model employee. However, he soon discovers that his job is far from ordinary. Unbeknownst to him, Hiroya has been enlisted in the Special Duty Combat Unit, known as SHINESMAN, a secret department within the company. Their mission: to protect Earth from the hilariously nefarious alien forces of Planet Voice, led by Prince Sasaki.\n\nBalancing the mundane tasks of corporate life with the extraordinary duties of a superhero, Hiroya and his coworkers transform into the office-colored SHINESMAN team. As Shinesman Red, Sepia, Salmon Pink, Grey, and Moss Green, they don their combat Pro-suits and wage war against the alien menace.\n\nIf you think you've seen it all in shows like Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, or Dynaman, prepare for a wild ride through the zany and corporate world of SHINESMAN! With their unconventional weapons and office-themed suits, this team of unlikely heroes will have you cheering and laughing in equal measure.",
