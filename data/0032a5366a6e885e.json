  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Western lamps, a symbol of modernization, captivate a young orphan named Tatsunosuke during an errand in a nearby town. Inspired by the new technology, he introduces these lamps to his village and establishes a successful business, eventually marrying his childhood sweetheart, Setsu. However, as Japan continues to modernize, the threat of electricity looms over Tatsunke's lamp business, putting his family's livelihood at risk.\n\nYears later, Tatsunosuke's grandson, Toichi, discovers an old lamp in his grandfather's shed while playing hide-and-seek. Unaware of its significance, Toichi takes it outside to play, only to be reprimanded by his grandfather. In response, Tatsunosuke shares the story behind the lamp and the role it played in his youth during Japan's modernization.\n\nThis heartwarming tale, titled \"Ojii-san no Lamp,\" is one of four original anime produced by the Japan Animation Creators Association (JaniCA) as part of the 'Young Animator Training Project,' funded by the Agency of Cultural Affairs of Japan. The 23-minute anime, complete with opening and ending sequences, showcases the transformative power of technology and the challenges faced by those who embrace it.",
