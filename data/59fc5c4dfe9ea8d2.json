    "text": "End of the world or a new beginning? The decision rests on the shoulders of 15-year-old Kamui Shirou as he returns to Tokyo after a six-year absence. As a central figure in a prophecy foretold by the dream seer Princess Hinoto, Kamui must choose to ally himself with the Dragons of Heaven, who strive for peaceful coexistence between humans and nature, or the Dragons of Earth, who seek to eradicate humanity to save the planet.\n\nKamui's return to Tokyo is not without purpose; he seeks to fulfill his mother's dying wish and claim the Sacred Sword from the temple guarded by Kyougo Monou, father of his childhood friends Fuuma and Kotori. However, when a mysterious individual beats him to the sword, Kamui finds himself the target of both factions vying for his allegiance.\n\nAs the Seven Seals and the Seven Angels gather, Kamui struggles to accept his role in the impending battle that will determine the fate of the world. With the lives of his friends hanging in the balance, Kamui must confront his destiny and choose a side in this climactic struggle. Will he save humanity or bring about its doom? The year is 1999, and the final battle for the future of the world has begun.",
