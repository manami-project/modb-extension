  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After years of stagnation in the Japanese military, Rain Yashima finds herself on the brink of despair. The enemy army, the Seventh, boasts superior weaponry, leaving Rain's side at a significant disadvantage. But when destiny places a mysterious power in Rain's hands, she takes matters into her own hands, abandoning her womanhood to become a steel warrior. As she embarks on a solitary mission to change the course of history, Rain's battle against impossible odds begins.\n\nMeanwhile, the self-published creators of the military robot anime project, Koutetsu no Vendetta (Iron Vendetta), released a preview DVD at Tokyo's Comic Market 75 convention. The DVD features the unedited pilot film, supplemental videos, and key animation drawings, each with a runtime of under five minutes. Unfortunately, the project is currently on hold due to the dissolution of the production division of its sponsor, Ankama Japan.",
