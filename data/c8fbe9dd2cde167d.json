  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After several years serving in the Japanese military, Rain Yashima has grown frustrated with their passive stance and inferior weapons compared to their enemies, the Seventh. Believing defeat is imminent if things continue unchanged, Rain receives an opportunity to alter history's course. She is given the power to judge the past and weave a new future, abandoning her womanhood to fight as hardened steel. Now Rain's lonely battle begins, wielding the might to shape destiny to her will. Meanwhile, the military anime project Koutetsu no Vendetta has released a preview DVD containing unedited footage of their pilot film and supplemental videos, totaling under ten minutes combined. This ambitious fan-made production is currently on hold due to losing the support of their sponsor Ankama Japan. Despite this setback, the creative team behind Koutetsu no Vendetta remains passionate about realizing their vision. The preview DVD offers a promising if brief glimpse at the military sci-fi adventure they wished to produce, hinting at the potential for compelling characters and mecha action. Though the project's future is uncertain, its creators hope their labor of love may someday resume.",
