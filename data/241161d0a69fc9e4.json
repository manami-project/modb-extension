However, Tsubaki's world turns upside down when she begins to develop unexpected feelings and curiosity about the forbidden gender, leading her to question the very code she has sworn to uphold. As her fascination with men grows, Tsubaki struggles to maintain her focus on her ninja training and responsibilities, setting the stage for a heartwarming and comedic tale of self-discovery.",
