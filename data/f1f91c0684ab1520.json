However, the groom's pre-wedding jitters lead him to seek solitude in the mountains, leaving Miz furious and determined to find him. Enlisting the help of Makoto, Nanami, and others, they embark on a search that leads them to an unexpected discovery: another Ifurita residing in a hidden garden. Meanwhile, Jinnai and Diva inadvertently awaken a dormant demon named Kalia while on their quest for a new Bugrom homeland. Unlike her predecessor, Kalia possesses a mind of her own, with intentions that may jeopardize the peace of Roshtaria and the impending nuptials. Will our heroes be able to navigate these new challenges and ensure a happy ending for the couple?",
