  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This comedic sci-fi anime follows the ambitious yet inexperienced alien leader, Don, who, inspired by an advertisement, assembles a motley crew of extraterrestrials to conquer the universe. Joined by his lackadaisical comrade, Pepu, and gaming-addicted accomplice, Chiku, their first target is Earth, which seems like an easy victory according to their manuals. However, their invasion plans quickly go awry as they struggle to subdue the resilient human population. Forced to confront more mundane challenges like finding sustenance and affording rent, Don and his team must navigate life on Earth while attempting to achieve their grandiose goal of galactic domination. Along the way, they encounter quirky Earthlings and take up part-time jobs, leading to a series of hilarious and unexpected adventures. Despite their dubious beginnings, you can't help but root for this endearing group of aliens in their quest to rule the cosmos.",
