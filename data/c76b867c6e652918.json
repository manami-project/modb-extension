    "text": "Yang Wen-li, a historian turned reluctant military leader, and Reinhard von Lohengramm, a minor noble with dreams of ruling the galaxy, find themselves on opposing sides of a never-ending war between the Galactic Empire and the Free Planets Alliance. Thousands of years in the future, humanity has colonized the Milky Way and divided into these two interstellar states with vastly different forms of government. As the war rages on, these two brilliant strategists rise to power and face each other in a series of epic battles that could change the course of history and the fate of mankind. Will Reinhard's ambition to unite the galaxy under his rule prevail, or will Yang's desire for lasting peace triumph? As they navigate the complexities of war and politics, their actions will determine the future of the galaxy.",
