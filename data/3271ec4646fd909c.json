  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryosuke Aoike's award-winning anime, Catman, returns for its third season, now airing on Fuji Television and sponsored by SoftBank. In the bustling metropolis of Cattown, populated entirely by anthropomorphic cat-people, our protagonist Catman is on a perpetual quest for freedom and living life on his own terms. However, his unconventional lifestyle often clashes with the city's other inhabitants, leading to a series of drink-fueled brawls and high-stakes gambles.\n\nThis season, Catman's luck hasn't improved, as even a simple fall from a building entangles him with the formidable cheese mafia, who are gradually seizing control of the city. Amidst these challenges, Catman remains undeterred, finding solace in his two faithful companions: alcohol and gambling.\n\nUnique to Catman is its absence of spoken dialogue, with the narrative unfolding through English and Japanese subtitles, accompanied by a lively soundtrack. This innovative approach, combined with its distinctive flash animation style, sets Catman apart in the world of anime. Prepare for a thrilling ride as Catman navigates the perils and pleasures of Cattown in his relentless pursuit of freedom.",
