  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unable to detect their arrival, humans become unsuspecting hosts to a horde of alien parasites that descend from the skies, eager to infiltrate and seize control of their minds. These ravenous creatures can assume terrifying forms to satisfy their hunger for human flesh, while cleverly concealing themselves behind the facade of ordinary people. Amidst this silent invasion, a high school student named Shinichi Izumi finds himself in a unique predicament when one such parasite, later named Migi, fails to take over his brain and instead takes residence in his right hand.\n\nForced into a precarious coexistence, Shinichi and Migi must learn to rely on each other as they confront the growing threat of their fellow parasites. With the rest of humanity unaware of the looming danger, it falls upon this unlikely duo to protect themselves and those close to them. As they navigate the challenges of their symbiotic relationship, Shinichi and Migi strive to maintain their humanity and sanity in a world where trust is a luxury they can no longer afford. Can they overcome the insurmountable odds and safeguard humanity from the clutches of these sinister beings? Only time will tell.",
