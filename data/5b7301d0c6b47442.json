  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One morning during the rainy season in Tokyo, a woman with curly hair wakes up. As she goes about her morning routine, opening the curtains and washing her hair, she is suddenly afflicted by disturbing mental images related to self-hatred. These phantasmagorical visions continue to plague her, one after another. This animation short was created in 2015 by Tomomi Komazaki, a first-year graduate student at the Tokyo University of the Arts. It was produced through the university's Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation. The film features animation by Komazaki herself, music also composed by Komazaki, and sound design by Sachi Takahashi. While brief in length, the film offers a glimpse into its protagonist's inner turmoil and self-perception. As the woman grapples with these visions of self-loathing, the animation suggests a discord between how she sees herself and how she wishes to be seen. Through its impressionistic visuals, the short conveys a subjective, emotional experience.",
