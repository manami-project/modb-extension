  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Directorï¼šTomomi KOMAZAKI presents a poignant tale of self-discovery and inner turmoil in her 2015 debut work from Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation. The story unfolds on a drizzly morning when a woman with curly locks awakens to a barrage of surreal and haunting images reflecting her deep-seated self-loathing. As she rises from her bed and gazes at her reflection in the window, she becomes acutely aware of her curly hair, which seems to trigger an onslaught of phantasmagorical manifestations of her self-hatred. Accompanied by an evocative soundtrack also composed by KOMAZAKI and sound design by Sachi TAKAHASHI, this thought-provoking animated short film is sure to leave a lasting impression.",
