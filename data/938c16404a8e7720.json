  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After the Gatchaman team defeated Leader X, it seemed the threat was over. However, a surviving fragment of Leader X mutated into the villainous Leader Z. Hungry for revenge and world domination, Leader Z recruited the megalomaniac Count Egobossler and his subordinates to build a destructive army. To combat this new danger, the Gatchaman team returned with upgraded weapons and technology. Operating from an underwater base, they received a powerful new ship called the Gatchaspartan. However, the ship's ultimate weapon came at a cost - it drained the life force of pilot Ken the Eagle each time it was used. As Leader Z's plans ramp up, involving an antimatter asteroid dubbed \"Poison Apple\", Ken faces a terrible choice. He can keep using the weapon to stop Leader Z, sacrificing himself in the process, or hold back and potentially doom humanity. The stakes have never been higher for the Science Ninja Team. Will their courage, skill and new arsenal be enough to defeat Leader Z's animatronic asteroid and army? Or will his quest for revenge and earthly destruction prevail? The fate of the planet hangs in the balance.",
