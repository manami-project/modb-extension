  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gakkai, a benevolent teacher, introduces the art of origami to his young pupils. However, when he gifts a beautifully crafted paper crane to one of the children, Takeshi, the notorious class bully, seizes it. To Takeshi's surprise, the crane is not just an ordinary piece of origami but a sentient spaceship that whisks him and his friends away to a celestial amusement park. During their cosmic adventure, a girl plummets into a dark abyss known as Space Hell, prompting the children to unite and orchestrate a daring rescue. Upon awakening, Takeshi is left questioning the reality of his extraordinary experience. The following day, he returns the enchanted crane to its original owner. This captivating tale hails from the imagination of Daisuke Ikeda, the leader of the Buddhist Soka Gakkai organization, which is often controversially labeled as a cult due to its affiliation with the shinshuukyou religious movement.",
