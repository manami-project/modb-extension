  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's 2023 in Tokyo, and with the rapid expansion of global trade and internationalization, the city's underworld has become more intricate and formidable than ever before. Criminal organizations are growing in size and power, posing a significant threat to the city's peace and security. To combat this rising tide of crime, the government has established a top-secret, extralegal police unit known as Warriors.\n\nThis elite team consists of three extraordinary women, each with their own unique skills and backgrounds. There's Jingu Maya, a weapons specialist with a haunted past, Kinezono Rio, a martial arts prodigy on a quest for love, and Lilica Evette, a psychic with a surprisingly low tolerance for alcohol. Together, they take on the most dangerous and high-stakes cases, from disarming bombs to taking down armed biker gangs.\n\nBut as they delve deeper into Tokyo's criminal underworld, they begin to uncover hints of a sinister organization that may be closer to home than they ever imagined. With their unique abilities and unwavering determination, the Warriors are the city's best hope against this new wave of crime.",
