    "text": "Astro Boy is an upbeat 5-year-old robot boy living in a futuristic town where humans and robots coexist. Though he appears as an innocent, playful child, he possesses incredible strength and the ability to fly. Astro Boy lives with his robot parents and often goes on adventures with his human friends and mentor Dr. O'Shay, eagerly exploring the world around him. However, Astro Boy's cheerful nature and special abilities catch the attention of the sinister mansion-dwelling criminal Hamegg. Seeking to exploit Astro Boy's powers for his own gain, Hamegg enlists help from his friends - mad scientist Dr. Flau and Gora, a large pink gorilla robot. Together, they frequently interfere with Astro Boy's adventures, presenting unexpected troubles through their nefarious schemes. But Astro Boy and his companions bravely persevere. Facing down Hamegg, Gora, and Dr. Flau's tricks, their efforts unfold into a journey filled with challenges to overcome and wondrous discoveries about the world's values. Though Hamegg aims to outsmart, outdo or even just impress Astro Boy, the plucky robot boy either finds success against Hamegg's plots or winds up working cooperatively with him. Through it all, Astro Boy retains his upbeat spirit, learning important lessons during his adventures with friends.",
