    "text": "Kumo no Mukou, Yakusoku no Basho director, Makoto Shinkai, presents a heartwarming short anime clip for NHK's Minna no Uta program, featuring the song \"Egao\" by Hiromi Iwasaki. In a serene Japanese apartment, a young woman finds solace and companionship in her tiny orange hamster, a creature she cherishes and carries with her. As she navigates through life's ups and downs, cooking sessions, and breathtaking scenery, the bond between them deepens. However, amidst the joy the hamster brings, she finds herself reminiscing about a former love. This poignant tale delicately intertwines the threads of love, loss, and the simple pleasure found in the company of a beloved pet.",
