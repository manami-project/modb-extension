  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Drunk and dejected after his long-time crush, Airi Gotou, rejects him, salaryman Yoshida stumbles upon a young high school girl, Sayu Ogiwara, on the side of the road. In his inebriated state, he allows her to stay overnight at his apartment. The following morning, Yoshida learns that Sayu has run away from her home in Hokkaido, and despite his initial reservations, he cannot bring himself to turn her out onto the streets. Instead of succumbing to her seductive offers, Yoshida insists that she contribute to the household through chores. Thus begins an unusual yet heartwarming cohabitation between a heartbroken salaryman and a runaway high school girl.",
