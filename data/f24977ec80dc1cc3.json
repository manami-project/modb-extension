But her dreams are disrupted when she gets dragged into the school's C3 Club, a group obsessed with playing intense survival games using airsoft guns. Despite her reluctance, Yura soon finds herself caught up in the club members' passion for battle games. Led by the dedicated president Sonora Kashima, C3 members Karila, Honoka, Rento, and Yachiyo thrive on the excitement of their mock skirmishes. As Yura participates in more matches, she discovers a thrill and skill for airsoft combat she didn't know she had. Still, Yura grapples with balancing her newly awakened warrior side with her desire for a regular school life. Can she integrate her warring hobby with her quest to be a normal student? Or will she lose herself to the command, control and communication of the battlefield?",
