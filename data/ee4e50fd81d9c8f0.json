    "text": "In the prosperous world of immortals in the Jiuzhou Continent, cracks appear in the boundary wall, allowing demon invaders from another realm to infiltrate the immortal sects. Sword Immortal Mu Xun and allies try to stop the invasion but fall into a trap, wrongly accused as traitors. To uncover demon clues, Mu Xun hides his identity and sends his son Dongfang Hao to be raised by others. Despite his esteemed lineage, Dongfang Hao is seen as ordinary for not exhibiting potential. Yet when danger strikes, his relentless efforts save the day, proving his mettle on the path to immortality. Whether taming dragons in the Taichu Secret Realm or saving friends in the Zhaowu King’s capital, Dongfang Hao aids allies while seeking his missing father. Through honing skills and magic, he is determined to expose the lurking demons, clear his father’s name, reunite the divided immortal sects and drive the invaders out - restoring peace in the Jiuzhou Continent.",
