    "text": "Shin, a ruthless gang leader, and Raoh, a power-hungry warrior, threaten the remnants of humanity in a post-apocalyptic wasteland ravaged by nuclear war. Amidst the chaos, Kenshirou, a lone martial artist and rightful heir to the deadly Hokuto Shinken technique, embarks on a perilous journey to rescue his beloved fianc√©e, Yuria, from their clutches. After being defeated and left for dead by his former friend Shin, Kenshirou must face his adversaries once more, including the vengeful Raoh who seeks world domination. With civilization in ruins and survival a constant struggle, Kenshirou's mastery of Hokuto Shinken may be the last hope for humanity. As he navigates the treacherous landscape, he will discover that the line between hero and villain is blurred, and only the strongest can restore balance to this desolate world.",
