  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zeta School for Girls and Nu School for Boys are thrilled to unite, leading Char and Haman to organize a grand festival. However, the celebration takes an unexpected turn when the Counterattack School, spearheaded by Amuro, Judau, and Kamille, storms the event. In the second part, 'The Tale of the SD Warring States: The Chapter of the Violent Final Sky Castle', the narrative shifts to the fictional realm of Ark. Here, the mobile suits and mobile armors from the more serious Gundam stories are reimagined as super deformed sentient samurai, transporting viewers to an era reminiscent of ancient Japan. This two-part anime promises a thrilling ride filled with unexpected twists and captivating action.",
