  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime consists of two stories that provide a fun and comedic take on the Gundam universe. The first part, \"The Storm-Calling School Festival,\" centers around characters from various Gundam series attending rival schools. Char and Haman from the Zeon faction host a festival to unite their Nu School for Boys with the Zeta School for Girls. However, their party is crashed by the rambunctious Counterattack School gang led by Gundam protagonists Amuro, Judau, and Kamille. Hijinks and chaos inevitably ensue. The second part titled \"The Tale of the SD Warring States: The Chapter of the Violent Final Sky Castle\" transports iconic mobile suits into an imaginative feudal Japan setting. Re-envisioned as sentient samurai warped in eternal conflict, this comedic twist on warring factions offers lighthearted absurdity. With madcap school antics and chibi-fied suits of armor facing off in pseudo-historical battles, this two-part OVA promises Gundam devotees a goofy parody adventure. Both long-time fans and casual viewers can delight in this irreverent celebration of giant robot mayhem.",
