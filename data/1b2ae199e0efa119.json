  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From the quiet corners of a high school library, a peculiar tale unfolds between a reserved senior and a mischievous freshman. Nagatoro, a first-year student with a knack for teasing, finds her favorite pastime in tormenting her older classmate, Senpai. Stumbling upon Senpai's self-drawn manga, Nagatoro becomes intrigued by his talent and awkward demeanor, leading her to a relentless pursuit of mockery and provocation.\n\nAs the days go by, Senpai finds himself entangled in Nagatoro's web of antics, forced to endure her whims and caprices. Yet, as their interactions deepen, a strange bond forms between them. Senpai, initially irritated and embarrassed, begins to appreciate Nagatoro's company, finding a twisted sense of enjoyment in their peculiar relationship.\n\nNagatoro's motivations remain a mystery. Is she merely seeking to create misery for Senpai, or could there be a hidden affection behind her relentless teasing? As Senpai navigates through this tumultuous friendship, one thing is certain: his once monotonous life is now anything but dull.",
