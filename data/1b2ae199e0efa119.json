  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hayase Nagatoro is a high-spirited freshman who loves to tease her introverted senior Naoto. One day, Nagatoro discovers Naoto working on his manga drawings in the library. Amused by his awkwardness, she decides to make him her new victim. At first, Nagatoro's relentless antics embarrass and frustrate Naoto. She forces him to indulge her whims, like posing for her sketches, going on runs, and playing video games. Over time though, Nagatoro's playful bullying takes on an almost flirtatious tone. Naoto finds her annoying yet charming company not entirely unwelcome. While Nagatoro seems intent on pushing Naoto out of his comfort zone, she also appears invested in his hobbies and passions, critiquing his manga and making sure he keeps drawing. Their days together are certainly never boring. Through all the teasing emerges an unusual but genuine friendship. Where it will lead remains to be seen.",
