    "text": "Gym classes and textbooks take a back seat as Ayane Mitsui, a high school student with a fiery spirit, pursues her dream of becoming a professional wrestler. With a powerful high-kick and unwavering determination, Ayane's journey takes an unexpected turn when a seasoned trainer, Kunimitsu Tangay, offers to guide her to greatness. Little does Ayane know, Tangay's true intentions involve transforming her into a formidable kickboxer, a sport she despises.\n\nAs Ayane juggles her secret training with the pressures of school and keeping her mother in the dark, she unknowingly finds herself on the path to a kickboxing tournament. Betrayed and furious, Ayane faces a difficult decision when the top contender of the All-Japan Kickboxing League, Sakurako Miyagawa, challenges her to a fight. With her school strictly forbidding violent extracurricular activities, will Ayane rise to the challenge and unleash her high-kick on the kickboxing world, or will she risk her education for a chance at victory?",
