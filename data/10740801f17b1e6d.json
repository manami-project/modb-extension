    "text": "Nodoka Haramura, a talented mahjong player, transfers schools and leaves behind her close friends, Shizuno Takakamo and Ako, at Achiga Girls' Academy. The mahjong club at Achiga, once a formidable rival to Bansei High School, had been disbanded following a defeat in the national semifinals. Years later, Shizuno and Ako catch a glimpse of Nodoka on TV, where she is crowned the national middle school mahjong champion. Inspired by their friend's success, the duo decides to breathe new life into their school's mahjong club, aiming to reunite with Nodoka at the National High School Mahjong Tournament. However, the journey to the top is fraught with challenges, as they face off against skilled opponents like Saki Miyanagi, who seem to possess an uncanny ability to manipulate probability. Despite the odds, the determined girls of Achiga High Mahjong Club persevere, driven by their dream to compete against their long-lost friend once more.",
