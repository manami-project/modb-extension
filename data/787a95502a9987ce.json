  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the provided information, this animated short is a collaboration between the Pokémon franchise and artist Daniel Arsham. It features iconic Pokémon characters Satoshi and Pikachu. In the midst of an intense Pokémon battle, Satoshi and Pikachu are suddenly transported through time and space to a strange new place after being surrounded by a bright light. They set off on an adventure to find the Mythical Pokémon Celebi, who seems to be the key to returning them to their original time and place. This animated short was created specially for Daniel Arsham's art exhibition \"A Ripple in Time,\" on display in Tokyo. It was directed by Kunihiko Yuyama, known for his work as chief director of the original Pokémon anime series. The exhibition and short film creatively blend Arsham's signature aesthetic with the beloved world of Pokémon. By weaving together elements of time travel, vibrant battles, and the quest to get home, this collaborative animation promises to be a thrilling mini-adventure for Pokémon fans. The preview already released has likely piqued interest for the full short's premiere.",
