  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Morimori Academy is an all-boys boarding school located deep in the mountains. The story follows Takashi Toono, a first-year student who transfers into Morimori midway through the year. Feeling like an outcast at first, Toono soon befriends the kind and cheerful Kyousuke Yaguchi. However, due to the school's policy requiring all students to join a club, Toono decides to join the seemingly laidback Photography Club instead of the Soccer Club with Yaguchi. But Toono soon discovers the Photography Club is actually nicknamed the \"Yarichin Bitch Club,\" filled with eccentric upperclassmen who offer sexual services to pent-up students purely for enjoyment. Toono's fellow transfer student Yuu Kashima has also joined the club. Both new members struggle with the club's shocking secret activities and strict monthly quotas. And failure to meet these quotas results in severe punishment. As Toono's dilemma grows, Yaguchi supports him as a friend. But complications also arise as both underclassmen develop budding romances and attractions to their upperclassmen. The Photography Club must unite to deal with their secrets, sexual escapades, and even a stalker among them.",
