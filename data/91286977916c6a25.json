  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Private Morimori Academy, nestled deep in the mountains, becomes the new home for Takashi Toono, a mid-year transfer student. Initially feeling out of place, he finds solace in the company of the affable Kyousuke Yaguchi. However, the school's mandatory club policy forces him to join the seemingly laid-back Photography Club, which turns out to be far from what he expected.\n\nKnown as the 'Yarichin Bitch Club,' the club members provide sexual services to the academy's students, driven solely by their love for intimacy. Toono's predicament worsens when he learns about the club's strict monthly quota, with severe consequences for non-compliance. Desperate and running out of options, Toono finds support in Yaguchi and fellow transfer student, Yuu Kashima, who shares his plight.\n\nAs the newcomers grapple with their challenging situation, the club must also navigate a web of secrets, desires, and even stalkers. Amidst this chaos, Toono finds himself drawn to Yaguchi, while Yaguchi can't help but blush around Kashima, adding another layer of complexity to their already intricate relationships. This is a tale of love, friendship, and survival in an all-boys boarding school that's anything but ordinary.",
