  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tamahi, a typical high school student, finds her ordinary life taking a dramatic turn when she and her friends stumble upon an unsettling incident on their way home from school. They witness a figure plummeting from a nearby apartment building, prompting them to investigate. However, instead of finding the expected scene of chaos, they discover an eerily deserted building. As Tamahi grapples with the strange circumstances, she can't shake off the feeling of being under surveillance by an unseen entity. Unbeknownst to her, the abandoned building is a hotbed of grotesque creatures lurking in the shadows. This chilling tale serves as a prelude to \"Aragne: Sign of Vermillion,\" setting the stage for Tamahi's encounters with the supernatural in a colossal apartment complex.",
