  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Taichi and Rin were regular high school students until one fateful day when a magical circle transported them to a fantasy world full of magical creatures and races like elves, dwarves, and beastmen. Threatened by a monster attack soon after their arrival, they were saved by a group of adventurers who advised them to register at the Adventurers Guild to determine their magical abilities and better defend themselves. At the guild, Taichi and Rin discovered they possessed extraordinarily powerful magic that went beyond standard mages - Taichi commanded multiple magical attributes like a Quad Magician, while Rin had unique abilities no attribute could account for. With their \"cheat\" magic, the duo transformed from average teenagers into the realm's strongest magicians overnight. Now faced with this unfamiliar world, Taichi and Rin decide to become adventurers as they try to find a way back home. But danger lurks as monster attacks increase, and the pair soon realize their fantastic powers have drawn the attention of those with sinister intents. They must quickly master their magic and brace for threats hidden in the shadows. Will the cheat magicians uncover the secrets behind their transportation across worlds? And will their mighty abilities be enough to survive the looming threats and return home? Taichi and Rin's ultimate adventure has just begun.",
