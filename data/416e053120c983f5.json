  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unai-Otome, a beautiful young woman from the village of Ikuta, found herself in the midst of a heart-wrenching dilemma. Torn between two suitors who deeply loved her, she was unable to choose either. In her despair, she chose to end her own life, hoping for peace in death. However, even death did not provide her the tranquility she yearned for.\n\nDecades later, a wandering monk on his way to the capital finds himself in Ikuta, searching for the legendary Seeker's Mound. After receiving no assistance from the local women, he encounters a mysterious maiden by the river who claims to know the mound's location. She leads him to the mound, revealing it to be the resting place of the beautiful Maid of Unai. The maiden then begins to narrate the tragic tale of Unai-Otome.\n\nThe film is a masterful adaptation of a classic Noh theatre play, expertly portraying the absurdity of the human condition. It showcases the pinnacle of Kawamoto's storytelling prowess, promising a poignant and thought-provoking viewing experience.",
