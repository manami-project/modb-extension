  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Eating undercooked fish, leaving food unattended, and washing clothes in the river may seem harmless, but these actions can unknowingly spread dangerous diseases. To prevent this, disinfection with bleach and exposure to sunlight are crucial. Wearing masks is also essential to block the entry of harmful germs. Neglecting these precautions can lead to the spread of illness, affecting not just one person, but entire families and eventually, all of Japan. This animated film aims to promote awareness about the importance of hygiene, drawing inspiration from earlier science films that used microscopic cinematography to showcase the spread of diseases. This film stands out as it uses only animation to convey its message, making it a unique and engaging way to educate the public about the importance of hygiene.",
