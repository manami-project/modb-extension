  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One year before Ren Mihashi joins his high school baseball team, drama unfolds within Musashino High's squad. Ace pitcher Naoto Kaguyama feels threatened by the intense dedication displayed by talented freshman recruit Motoki Haruna. Questioning why such a devoted player would join their low-ranked school, insecure Kaguyama contemplates quitting, fearing Haruna aims to take his coveted spot on the mound. After confiding his self-doubt, Haruna reassures Kaguyama, explaining his motivation is team-focused - to transform Musashino into a squad deserving of its players' full talents. Recognizing Haruna's passion for the game and desire to win, battery mate Takaya Abe becomes an admirer, though initial tensions lurk amongst the trio vying to bring glory to their baseball program. With senior Kaguyama's position secure but vulnerable, the stage is set for an intra-squad rivalry to unfold, potentially threatening team chemistry or catalyzing them to new heights.",
