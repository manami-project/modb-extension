    "text": "Rino’s life takes an unexpected turn when she receives an invitation to attend the prestigious Gokujou Girls’ School, an all-girls institution with a student council that boasts more influence and business savvy than most corporations. Rino, a seemingly ordinary girl with no special talents, is surprisingly accepted into the council, leaving everyone puzzled. With her talking puppet Pucchan by her side, Rino befriends the talented members of the council, all the while unaware of the mysterious affection the council president, Kanade Jinguuji, has for her. As Rino and Pucchan navigate through the eccentricities of the council and the school, they leave a lasting impact on everyone they encounter. But will Rino's naïve nature and Pucchan's mischievous streak be enough to uncover the secrets that lie within the council and the school? Only time will tell.",
