  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Five high school teachers, each with their own quirks and eccentricities, take on the role of mother figures for their student, Chitose Hitotose, an orphan navigating the challenges of adolescence. As they strive to provide him with a loving and nurturing environment, Chitose must conceal his unconventional living situation from his classmates, including the ever-curious class president, Fumitsuki Nanakorobi. Amidst the whirlwind of 'motherly affections' contests, beach vacations, and school events, Chitose grapples with his burgeoning feelings for a childhood friend and even finds himself the unwilling host of a mischievous spirit. Join Chitose and his teacher-moms as they embark on a series of comedic and heartwarming adventures, from turning a peaceful seaside resort upside down to experiencing a Christmas season filled with laughter, tears, and cherished memories. Through the chaos and laughter, Chitose discovers the true meaning of family and the beauty of life's quiet moments.",
