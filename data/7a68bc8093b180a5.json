  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In July 1998, teenager Fujino Asagami is brutally raped by a street gang in an abandoned bar. The next day, horrifically mutilated bodies are discovered in the same building. Investigators believe no human could be capable of such violence. Around this time, Mikiya Kokutō helps an ailing girl he finds collapsed on the street. This girl is revealed to be Fujino Asagami, the sole survivor of the bar murders. Like Shiki Ryōgi, who possesses Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, Fujino has powerful psychokinetic abilities allowing her to gruesomely bend and reshape objects and people. Shiki is dispatched to capture or kill the perpetrator behind the murders. A race against time begins as Shiki confronts this dangerous new foe. In the end, the confrontation comes down to a fateful decision by Shiki.",
