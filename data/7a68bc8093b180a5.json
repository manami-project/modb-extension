    "text": "July 1998, on a fateful night, Mikiya comes to the aid of a young girl crippled with stomach pain. Simultaneously, the city is terrorized by a series of gruesome murders, with victims dismembered beyond human capability. The perpetrator of these heinous acts is none other than the girl Mikiya rescued, Fujino Asagami. Like Shiki, who wields the supernatural Mystical Eyes of Death Perception, Fujino possesses a psychokinetic ability to manipulate anything. As Shiki embarks on a mission to apprehend or eliminate the culprit, a thrilling race against time ensues, pushing Shiki to her limits against an enemy undetectable even by her legendary eyes. The climactic battle's outcome hinges on the crucial decision Shiki must make.",
