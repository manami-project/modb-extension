  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kazuya lives with a group of magical girls who are romantically interested in him. Their affection leads to constant arguing and competition over his attention. However, the dynamics shift with the sudden arrival of two mysterious girls from a rocket. One claims to be Kazuya's wealthy fiancée from the future. The other girls become desperate to bond with Kazuya before this supposed fiancée. Their tactics range from shouting matches to romantic gestures, though their antics prove divisive. Tensions escalate further with the emergence of a sinister new enemy. She preys on the girls' innocence and relationships, seemingly intent on turning them against one another for her own nefarious purposes. As rivalry gives way to suspicion and external threats mount, the once carefree household descends into turmoil. Kazuya and the girls face their greatest test yet - weathering internal conflicts and confronting the malicious force preying on their bonds, or else lose themselves and each other in the process.",
