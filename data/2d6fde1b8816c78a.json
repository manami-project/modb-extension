  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Benio Adashino, a prodigious exorcist, and Rokuro Enmado, a reluctant yet gifted young boy, find themselves entwined in a shared destiny as the 'Twin Star Exorcists.' In a world where grotesque creatures known as Kegare, or Impurities, lurk in the parallel realm of Magano, these two exorcists must join forces to purge the world of these evil apparitions. Despite Rokuro's tragic past and initial reluctance to embrace his exorcist lineage, Benio's unwavering determination and competitive spirit ignite a renewed sense of purpose in him. As they navigate through a series of escalating battles against the Kegare, Rokuro and Benio must confront their personal demons and learn to fight in unison. Their shared destiny, as foretold by an oracle, not only binds them in matrimony but also prophesizes the birth of a child who will become the ultimate exorcist, capable of eradicating all Kegare from the world.",
