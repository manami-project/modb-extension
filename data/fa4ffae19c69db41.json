    "text": "Unaware of the impending doom, the human race continues their daily lives in 2203, oblivious to the catastrophic event that has transformed their sun into a deadly time bomb. A rogue missile, intended for destruction in the war between the Galman Empire and the Bolar Federation, has struck the sun, causing a perilous surge in nuclear fusion. With only one year left before the radiation annihilates Earth, the Star Force is reassembled, and the iconic Space Battleship Argo embarks on a critical mission to secure a new home for humanity. Joined by eager new recruits, the crew faces a universe plagued by the territorial conflicts of two formidable empires, turning their journey into a treacherous battle for survival. As they venture beyond the solar system, the Star Force must navigate the cosmic warzone and overcome unforeseen dangers to find a suitable planet for resettlement before time runs out.",
