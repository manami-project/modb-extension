    "text": "Demanding repayment for a debt incurred by her late grandfather, an ogre deity kidnaps Aoi, a college student with the unique ability to see spirits known as ayakashi. Inheriting this supernatural sight and her culinary skills from her grandfather, Aoi feeds the ayakashi to prevent them from consuming humans. The ogre deity, Oodanna, proposes marriage to settle the debt, but Aoi staunchly refuses and instead vows to work at his heavenly inn to pay off the balance. With her delectable dishes, Aoi begins to positively impact the lives of the various ayakashi residing at the inn, changing their destinies one meal at a time.",
