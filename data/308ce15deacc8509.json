    "text": "Based in the gritty streets of New York, an accomplished Japanese karate fighter, Gai, embarks on a transformative journey to become a formidable boxing champion. Motivated by the desire to secure the necessary funds for his ailing father's critical surgery, Gai places his trust in the guidance of Roman, a legendary boxer turned trainer.\n\nIn this heart-wrenching tale adapted from Motoka Murakami's manga, Gai's path intertwines with a cancer-stricken doctor and a transgender individual battling AIDS. Together, they form an unconventional yet unbreakable bond as they strive to overcome their individual adversities. This poignant narrative not only showcases the raw power of determination but also delves deep into the human spirit's resilience when faced with seemingly insurmountable challenges.",
