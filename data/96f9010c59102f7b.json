  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gokudo, a boastful and skilled swordsman with a penchant for mischief, finds his life turned upside down when he steals a seemingly worthless rock from a fortune teller. To his surprise, the rock is home to a stubborn and unconventional Djinn who grants him three wishes, albeit not in the way he had hoped. Among his wishes, Gokudo receives the Honou no Maken, a magical sword capable of summoning fire attacks from anywhere in the world. Despite wielding this powerful weapon, Gokudo's life is far from ordinary.\n\nTransformed into a woman by the shapeshifting Djinn and accompanied by the adventurous and competitive Rubette La Lette, Gokudo's journey is filled with humorous misadventures. Plagued by the vengeful fortune teller and joined by Prince, a charming and former evil magician, Gokudo's quest to save the magical world is anything but predictable. With a diverse cast of characters, including royalty, mythical creatures, and gods, this anime delivers a perfect blend of comedy, action, and adventure.",
