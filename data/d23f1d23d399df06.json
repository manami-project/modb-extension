Yoshiyuki Momose, the esteemed director of Ghiblies, took the helm as supervisor for this short masterpiece. On November 16th, 2004, the film found its place on the 'Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Short' DVD, nestled among other Ghibli gems such as Sorairo no Tane, On Your Mark, Space Station No.9, Nandaro, and an assortment of commercials.\n\nIn this heartwarming tale, a young girl's dreams take flight as she leafs through the glossy pages of a fashion magazine.
