    "text": "Mete out punishment upon the realm of the gods. What if the characters we've created in our countless stories had their own will? In Re:CREATORS, everyone becomes a Creator.\n\nSouta Mizushino, a high school student with dreams of becoming a light novel author, finds himself mysteriously transported into an anime battle scene. He returns to the real world with Selesia Upitiria, a fictional character from the anime, in tow. As the heroine grapples with the realization that her world and herself are merely fiction, other characters from various tales begin to appear throughout Japan.\n\nA magician, a mecha pilot with their mecha, a magical girl, and a ruthless swordsman are just a few of the characters that now populate modern Japan. Each one deals with their new situation in different ways, and no one knows how to explain this phenomenon. A mysterious girl in uniform seems to be behind it all, with sinister plans of her own.\n\nAs the line between reality and fiction blurs, Souta and Selesia work with Meteora Ã–sterreich, a calm and composed librarian NPC, to uncover the truth behind these events. The once clear boundary between creator and creation continues to dissolve, leading to a fateful encounter between the two worlds. Will coexistence remain peaceful, or will chaos reign? Only time will tell in Re:CREATORS.",
