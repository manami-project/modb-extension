    "text": "Hinata, Kageyama, and the rest of the Karasuno High School Volleyball team are gearing up for the biggest challenge of their lives: the nationals. After a grueling battle in the Miyagi Prefecture Spring Tournament, they've finally secured their spot. But the road to the top is far from easy. As they prepare for the competition, Kageyama receives an invitation to the prestigious All-Japan Youth Training Camp, while Tsukishima is invited to a special rookie training camp for first-years in Miyagi Prefecture. Feeling left out, Hinata takes matters into his own hands and crashes the Miyagi Prefecture rookie training camp. Despite being relegated to the role of a ball boy, Hinata sees this as an opportunity to reflect on his skills and learn from the other players. As the team faces new challenges, they must overcome their weaknesses and refine their skills to make it to the top. Get ready for an action-packed season of \"Haikyu!!\" as Karasuno High School Volleyball Club takes on the nationals.",
