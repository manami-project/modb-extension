    "text": "Starry-eyed and brimming with curiosity, Hikaru, a middle school student with a passion for the cosmos, encounters extraterrestrial beings Lala, Prunce, and the fluffy Fuwa while stargazing one night. The aliens reveal the plight of the Star Palace, a celestial realm where the 12 Star Princesses, representing the constellations, maintained universal harmony until a vicious attack scattered them across the universe in the form of the Princess Star Color Pens.\n\nIn a quest to restore the princesses and prevent the universe from succumbing to darkness, Lala and Prunce embark on a journey to find the legendary Precure warriors. When Fuwa is captured by the enemy, Hikaru's fervent desire to save Fuwa triggers the appearance of a Star Color Pendant and a Star Color Pen, enabling her transformation into the valiant Cure Star.\n\nHikaru's mission becomes clear: to collect the scattered Princess Star Color Pens and nurture Fuwa, who holds the key to reviving the princesses. As the leader of the Star Twinkle PreCure, Hikaru teams up with Lala and fellow warriors Elena and Madoka to combat the Knot Raiders, the malevolent force threatening to consume the universe. Prepare for an interstellar adventure filled with courage, friendship, and the unyielding power of hope as Hikaru and her allies strive to restore balance to the universe.",
