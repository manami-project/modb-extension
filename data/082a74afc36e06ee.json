  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tamaki Kasuga is a high school girl whose life is turned upside down when her parents move abroad and she goes to live with her grandmother in a remote village. There, she learns of her destiny as the next Tamayori Princess, tasked with sealing away dangerous mythical creatures and an ancient magical sword called Onikirimaru. Though skeptical at first, Tamaki soon finds herself under attack by one-eyed monsters called Logos. She is rescued by her aloof classmate Takuma and four other handsome young men who introduce themselves as her sworn protectors. Bound by duty to safeguard each Tamayori Princess, they explain that Tamaki must now take on the responsibility passed down through her ancestral bloodline. As she adjusts to her new supernatural reality, Tamaki tries to seal away the dark forces suddenly invading her village while also navigating high school politics. Thankfully, Takuma and the others always have her back. But the Logos are growing stronger, and the seal containing Onikirimaru begins to weaken. To fulfill her destiny as a Tamayori Princess, Tamaki must unlock her dormant powers before the village and her loved ones are destroyed.",
