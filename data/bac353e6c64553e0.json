  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In ancient China, the Yin Dynasty is facing a crisis - demon immortals have infested the empire, causing rot and decay from within. To combat this threat, the Immortal High Council drafts Project Soul Hunt - a plan to vanquish 365 dangerous demon souls that are plaguing the land. However, the Council is reluctant to risk the life of a capable immortal for this dangerous mission. Instead, they decide to recruit the lazy, incompetent Taikoubou, figuring he's expendable. Taikoubou is known for shirking his lessons and duties to nap instead. Armed with only a magical rod, Taikoubou is partnered with the spiritual beast Sibuxiang and sent out to hunt the demons, not expecting to return alive. But demon-slaying requires serious on-the-job training and threats to Taikoubou's life abound. As the mission progresses, Taikoubou helps others in need, gains new allies, and grows into his role as demon-hunter. Though reluctant at first, he digs deep to find the courage and skills to take on evil forces and save the Yin Dynasty from destruction. Through perseverance and some close calls, Taikoubou steps up to seal away the 365 demons and prove he is not as expendable as the Council first thought.",
