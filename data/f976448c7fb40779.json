    "text": "Wielder of a mysterious mechanical entity, Hikaru Amatsuga, an ordinary middle school student, finds his life turned upside down when he crosses paths with Alma, an enigmatic Mecha-Ude. Mecha-Udes, alien lifeforms that arrived on Earth long ago, fuse with humans and resemble robotic limbs. Alma, unlike others, fails to bind with Hikaru and instead forms a connection with his hoodie. As Hikaru gets entangled in the world of Mecha-Udes, he becomes the target of the Kagami Group, a powerful corporation seeking to weaponize these beings. Meanwhile, ARMS, a resistance group dedicated to protecting Mecha-Udes, assigns Aki Murasame, a dual Mecha-Ude user, to safeguard Hikaru and Alma. As Hikaru and Alma navigate thrilling adventures and perilous battles, they must find the strength to stand against the Kagami Group and uncover the truth behind the mythical Trigger Arm, a Mecha-Ude believed to possess unlimited power. In this extraordinary journey, Hikaru realizes that his ordinary life is a thing of the past.",
