    "text": "Hirano to Kagiura tells the heartwarming story of two high school roommates brought together by chance. Taiga Hirano is a laidback second-year student who takes the earnest first-year Akira Kagiura under his wing when they become dorm mates. As the months pass, Akira relies more and more on his reliable senior. Taiga wakes Akira up for basketball practice, helps him study, and makes sure he eats properly. A deep bond develops between the odd couple pair. Before long, Akira realizes his affection for Taiga has grown into full-blown love. But a bittersweet twist of fate looms - they only have six months left together as roommates. With the clock ticking down, shy Akira vows to confess his feelings to oblivious Taiga before their special dorm life comes to an end. Will the puppy-like kouhai find the courage to pursue his crush? Can their relationship evolve before the dorm doors close? Hirano to Kagiura promises laughs, tears, and a hopeful message about embracing each moment.",
