    "text": "In the heartwarming tale of Hirano to Kagiura, the story revolves around two high school students who share a dorm room and a unique bond. Taiga Hirano, a second-year student, finds himself living with Akira Kagiura, an earnest and hardworking freshman who's part of the basketball team. Despite initial apprehensions, Akira quickly grows fond of his senior, cherishing the moments they share - from morning wake-up calls to afternoon study sessions and breakfast in the cafeteria. However, Akira harbors a secret: he's fallen in love with Taiga. With only six months left of their roommate arrangement, Akira is determined to express his feelings to his oblivious senior, adding a touch of romantic tension to their heartfelt friendship. This endearing narrative accompanies the Sasaki to Miyano: Sotsugyou-hen movie as an animated short.",
