    "text": "How about this?\n\nAfter completing their internships, the students of Class 1-A at UA are thrown into a survival training exercise by their homeroom teacher, Shouta Aizawa. But this isn't just any ordinary training session - they'll be joined by four students from the rival Isami High School. Among the guests is an old friend of Tsuyu Asui's, but tensions quickly rise as Katsuki Bakugou clashes with one of the visitors. As the training progresses, things take a turn for the worse when a student's quirk goes awry, turning the exercise into a battle for survival against zombies. Can the students of Class 1-A and their new acquaintances work together to make it out alive? Find out in this thrilling OVA, which takes place after the field training arc in the second season and was bundled with the 14th volume of the manga.",
