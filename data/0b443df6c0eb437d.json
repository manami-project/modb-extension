    "text": "After returning from their internships, the students of UA High's Class 1-A prepare for their next training exercise. This time, they are joined by four students from rival school Isamu Academy High for a competitive survival game. The training doubles as a reunion between Class 1-A's Tsuyu Asui and her old middle school friend Habuko Mongoose, now an Isamu student. However, tensions flare when hotheaded Isamu student Romero Fujimi spars verbally with UA's own Katsuki Bakugo. This conflict comes to a head when an enraged Romero unleashes his \"zombie gas\" Quirk, causing those around him to transform into zombies. Now Class 1-A must contend with their comrades and rivals turned undead in a battle for survival. Will they be able to overcome this unexpected supernatural threat? Their training is about to take a very unorthodox turn as the students are caught up in an all-too-realistic zombie apocalypse scenario!",
