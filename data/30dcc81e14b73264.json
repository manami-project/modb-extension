  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Welcome to Count D's mysterious pet shop in Chinatown, where dreams and desires manifest in the form of rare and magical creatures. However, every pet comes with a binding contract - follow the rules, and your new companion will bring you joy. Break them, and you alone face the supernatural consequences. When a string of odd customer deaths is linked back to the shop, Detective Leon Orcot begins an investigation into its enigmatic owner. Count D seems friendly on the surface, but Leon suspects he is hiding sinister secrets about his unnatural pets and those fatal contracts. Determined to expose the truth, Leon stakes out the shop, yet the creatures and contracts he discovers defy all logic and reason. With otherworldly forces beyond his comprehension at play, Leon finds his case - and his sanity - put to the test. Will solving these bizarre deaths redeem Leon's career? Or has the detective finally come up against a mystery that could consume him completely? One thing is certain - at Count D's shop, the pets fulfill your fondest wishes, but tread carefully. Their power is not of this world, and they do not take betrayal lightly.",
