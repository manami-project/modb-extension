    "text": "After spending an eventful final year together in high school, Nachi and her bandmates in Irodorimidori have reached graduation. To commemorate this milestone and bid farewell to their time as students, the group comes together to give one last spirited musical performance. However, the end of high school does not spell the end for Irodorimidori or Nachi's musical journey - in fact, it signals only the beginning. With Nachi graduating, change is afoot for the band. Yet new horizons filled with possibility lie ahead, both for Nachi as she looks towards the future and for Irodorimidori as a group. Their time playing together has forged strong bonds of friendship and passion for music. Though they may be turning a page, there are still many more chapters left unwritten in their tale. This music video brings their high school days to a joyous close, while setting the stage for the adventures yet to come. Blending lively animation with the upbeat sounds of Irodorimidori, it captures the excitement, camaraderie and hopeful promise of setting off on the road ahead.",
