    "text": "Animelo Summer Live takes center stage with a delightful Kemono Friends anime short! Northern White-faced Owl and Eurasian Eagle-Owl embark on a mission to restore the run-down Saitama Super Arena, the actual venue for the concert event. As they gather their friends to help clean up, they stumble upon informative cards that teach them proper concert etiquette, like avoiding the use of electronic devices. The friends' curiosity is piqued, with some wondering about the mysterious 'mobile' and others dismissing it as an unappetizing item.\n\nAs the friends continue their work, they are astounded by the sheer number of people pouring into the venue, far exceeding their 100-person estimate. Feeling overwhelmed, they decide to make a quick exit. This charming short, which served as the intro for all three days of the 2017 Animelo Summer Live -THE CARD- anisong event, offers two alternate endings for viewers to enjoy.",
