  "synopsis": {
    "text": "For years, nations around the world banded together to prepare for the foretold arrival of the \"Neuroi\", a dangerous enemy that could only be combatted by courageous groups of magical girls called Witches. Specifically, Strike Witches squadrons 501 and 502 trained extensively, expecting to fight. However, the prophesied enemy never emerged. With no battles to fight, these Witches now find themselves contending with the mundane struggles of everyday life in times of peace. Laundry and chores replace life-and-death aerial dogfights. Though they once prepared for an epic fight to save humanity, now these magical girls spend their days caught up in silly hijinks and minor squabbles. This lighthearted anime follows the Witches of the 501st and 502nd Joint Fighter Wing as they try to find excitement, camaraderie, and purpose while the threat of the Neuroi fades. Will they find a new calling? Or will they spend their days idly waiting for an enemy that never comes?",
