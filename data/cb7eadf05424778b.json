    "text": "Will a simple USB stick drive a wedge between two young lovebirds? When Rikka Takanashi discovers that Makoto Isshiki has secretly passed a USB stick containing photos of an idol that Yuuta Togashi had a crush on during middle school, she becomes displeased with Yuuta. Despite the other girls instructing Yuuta to return the stick, Makoto secretly lets him keep it. In a twist of fate, Rikka sneaks into Yuuta's room and inadvertently destroys the stick while trying to hide it from him, leading to an argument over who was in the wrong. As neither side is willing to apologize, the girls enlist the help of Satone and Kuzuha to see how Yuuta reacts when Rikka doesn't come home. Will Yuuta's true feelings for Rikka be revealed, and will the two be able to make up and overcome this misunderstanding? Find out in this unaired episode 13 released with volume 7 of the Blu-ray and DVD.",
