  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rikka Takanashi and Yuuta Togashi seem to have a loving relationship, but it is put to the test when Rikka discovers that their friend Makoto Isshiki secretly passed Yuuta a USB flash drive containing old photos of Yuuta's middle school crush - a popular idol. Upset over this perceived betrayal, Rikka demands that Yuuta return the flash drive. Though Yuuta claims to have given the drive back, Rikka suspects he still has it and sneaks into his room, only to accidentally destroy the drive in her attempt to hide it. This leads to a heated argument between the two, both feeling wronged but refusing to apologize. Their friends intervene to see if Yuuta cares when Rikka stops coming home after their fight. They find that despite their disagreement, Yuuta still cares deeply for Rikka. Finally, Rikka and Yuuta reconcile, putting aside their pride and hurt feelings. Their spat over a past crush reminds them that honest communication is vital for any healthy relationship, even one between lovers bonded by magic and fantasy.",
