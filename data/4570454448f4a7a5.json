  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Alfred Pennyworth, Nightwing, Robin, Red Robin, Red Hood, Catwoman, and Batman find themselves in an unfamiliar era after a scuffle with Gorilla Grodd at Arkham Asylum goes awry. Grodd's Quake Engine malfunctions, catapulting Batman and his allies through time, landing them in the heart of feudal Japan. As they navigate this new landscape, they discover that their formidable foes, including the Joker, Harley Quinn, and Poison Ivy, have already established themselves as ruling warlords.\n\nWith the Joker leading the charge and the rest of Batman's enemies controlling various territories, Japan is now a playground for chaos. The Caped Crusader must adapt quickly, as his high-tech gadgets are no longer at his disposal. Embracing the ways of the ninja and samurai, Batman must rely on his wits, agility, and the support of his trusted allies to restore balance to the land.\n\nTheir mission is clear: reactivate the Quake Engine hidden within the ruins of Arkham Asylum, now known as Arkham Castle, and find their way back to present-day Gotham City. Join Batman and his team as they embark on an action-packed journey through time, facing off against familiar enemies in a world far removed from their own.",
