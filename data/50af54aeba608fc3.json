  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Agito's world is far from ordinary, where a botched DNA experiment granted plants sentience and sparked a war against humanity. The forest, now a formidable adversary, maintains an uneasy truce with the remaining human enclaves. Agito's city thrives in this verdant landscape, thanks to a select group of humans who have embraced the forest's influence. When Agito stumbles upon a forgotten relic containing a girl named Toola, who has been asleep for centuries, he inadvertently sets in motion a chain of events that could tip the scales in humanity's favor.\n\nToola, who carries the key to restore civilization, becomes the target of Shunack, a ruthless soldier determined to annihilate the forest. Agito, however, sees the forest not as an enemy, but as a partner in coexistence. To save Toola from Shunack's clutches and prevent the impending destruction, Agito forges a bond with the forest, gaining forbidden powers in the process. In a world teetering on the brink of chaos, Agito must navigate the complexities of human ambition, ancient technology, and the will of the forest to safeguard Toola and forge a path towards unity.",
