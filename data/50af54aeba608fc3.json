  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a post-apocalyptic world devastated by failed genetic experiments 300 years ago, humanity struggles to survive against sentient, aggressive forests that have overtaken the planet. In the present day, a tenuous peace exists between the few remaining human settlements and the dominant forests. Agito, a young villager, accidentally awakens Toola, a girl who has been asleep in a mysterious ancient machine for the past 300 years. Still seeking to fulfill a mission given to her in the past, Toola hopes to use technology to restore human civilization. However, the soldier Shunack manipulates Toola for his own goal of destroying the forests. Realizing that Shunack threatens both Toola and the forest, Agito makes a pact with the forest itself to gain forbidden powers. Now imbued with these powers, Agito pursues Toola in the hopes of saving her from Shunackâ€™s influence. To rescue both Toola and the natural world, Agito must bring humanity and the forest together rather than perpetuate past conflicts.",
