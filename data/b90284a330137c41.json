    "text": "A few months after the events of Steins;Gate, Okabe Rintaro and his friends at the Future Gadget Lab receive an invitation from their acquaintance Faris to accompany her to Los Angeles, where she will be participating in a competition. Eager for a change of scenery, the group decides to take Faris up on her offer. Upon arriving in Los Angeles, Okabe immediately attracts unwanted attention from airport security due to his eccentric \"Hououin Kyouma\" persona. After a few chaotic moments, the group checks into a run-down motel for the night, ready to make the most of their eventful American vacation. The next day, they reunite with Kurisu Makise, who had returned to America sometime after the tumultuous events in Japan. Kurisu begins questioning Okabe about fragmented memories from other world lines that have surfaced in her dreams, particularly about intimate moments between the two of them. As Kurisu seeks answers, Okabe contemplates how to respond to her resurfacing memories about their intertwined fates across multiple diverging timelines. Despite the unexpected complications, the Future Gadget Lab relishes the opportunity to enjoy a break from their usual routines. However, with Kurisu's probing about the shifting world lines, it seems Okabe cannot escape the allure of time travel and tangled destinies - no matter which country he finds himself in.",
