    "text": "She wanted a normal high school life, but fate had other plans for Mizuki Hijiri. As she steps into her new school, she finds herself in the whirlwind company of five extraordinary boys, each with their own unique quirks. Suffering from \"chuunibyou,\" a phase marked by delusions of grandeur, these boys bring anything but normalcy to Mizuki's life.\n\nMeet Rei Tsukumo, the self-proclaimed puppet master who believes he controls the strings of fate; Tomoki Takashima, the handsome otaku whose heart only flutters for 2D girls; Yamato Noda, the aspiring hero on a quest for greatness; Kazuhiro Nakamura, the reincarnated angel or devil who can't quite decide on his celestial identity; and Futaba Mikuriya, whose singing talents exist only in his own reality.\n\nAs Mizuki navigates through this eccentric world of delusions and grandiose imaginations, she finds herself drawn into their bizarre antics. Despite their quirks, these \"Outburst Dreamer Boys\" form a unique bond with Mizuki, promising a high school life that is far from ordinary. Brace yourself for a wild ride filled with laughter, friendship, and a touch of madness in this vibrant anime adaptation of Reruriri and Minato Fujinami's light novel.",
