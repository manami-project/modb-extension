  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Mizuki Hijiri transfers to a new high school, she hopes for a normal school life but her expectations are upended after a fateful encounter with the school's \"Hero Club.\" This eccentric group of boys all suffer from chuunibyou, an adolescent delusion of grandeur. There's Yamato Noda who fancies himself a righteous hero with athletic prowess. Then there's pretty boy otaku Tomoki Takashima whose heart belongs only to 2D anime girls. Also in the mix is Kazuhiro Nakamura, who believes he's the reincarnation of an angel/devil hybrid named Touga Ryushouin. And scheming puppet master Rei Tsukumo covertly pulls the Hero Club's strings. Despite their outrageous delusions, the Hero Club's bonds of friendship seem genuine. Mizuki gets swept up in their zany antics as the newest Hero Club member. She may have wanted normalcy but with this pack of chuunibyo dreamers, her school days look to be anything but ordinary!",
