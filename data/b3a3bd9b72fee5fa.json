    "text": "When an enigmatic artifact of ancient origins is unearthed during the construction of the Kurobe Dam, the United Nations establishes a dedicated research institute in Japan to unravel its mysteries. As the brightest scientific minds from across the globe converge on the facility, their children attend the nearby Mt. Tate International Senior High School, blissfully unaware of the cosmic drama unfolding around them.\n\nAt the heart of this whirlwind of scientific discovery is Yukina Shirahane, the introverted daughter of the institute's lead scientist. One fateful day, while visiting her mother at the research facility, Yukina inadvertently unlocks a piece of the artifact's puzzle, revealing a young samurai from the Sengoku era named Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma.\n\nAs a sinister extraterrestrial threat looms over Earth, Yukina and Kennosuke find themselves on the frontlines of a battle to defend their world. Along the way, Yukina uncovers the truth behind the samurai's unwavering resolve to protect her and the enigmatic connection that binds them together.\n\nIn the summer of 2016, the tale of a lone samurai's awakening unfolds, intertwining the fates of Yukina, Kennosuke, and the future of humanity itself.",
