    "text": "During the early 21st century, the United Nations establishes the Kurobe Research Institute in Japan to study an ancient artifact discovered during construction of the Kurobe Dam. Scientists and their families gather at the facility, including Yukina Shirahane, daughter of the institute's director. In 2016, Yukina solves part of the artifact's puzzle, causing a young Sengoku-era samurai named Kennosuke Tokisada Ouma to appear. Soon after, the facility comes under attack from invading mecha forces. Yukina, Kennosuke, the institute's students and pilots must fight back using mysterious artifacts and Kennosuke's samurai skills. As they defend Earth, Yukina uncovers the mystery behind Kennosuke's past and why he is determined to protect her. Their efforts lead them to confront the threat approaching from outer space.",
