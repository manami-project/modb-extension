  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yoshino Koharu, a recent college graduate with dreams of a thrilling life in Tokyo, finds herself in an unexpected role as a 'monarch' in the quaint agricultural town of Manoyama. After a series of misunderstandings, Yoshino joins the local tourism bureau, where she teams up with four other young women, each with their own career struggles and personal insecurities. As part of a nationwide initiative to revive Japan's bubble economy-era 'micro-nation' tourism programs, the girls are tasked with promoting their town's unique charm and culture. Through their combined efforts, they strive to bring new life to their dying town while learning valuable lessons about their industry, their community, and themselves. 'Sakura Quest' is a heartwarming tale of growth, friendship, and the delicate balance between preserving tradition and embracing change.",
