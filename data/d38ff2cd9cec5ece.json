    "text": "Garrod Ran, a young orphan navigating the desolate aftermath of the catastrophic 7th Space War, stumbles upon a relic of the past: the formidable Gundam X mobile suit. As Earth's survivors scavenge for resources amidst the ruins, ruthless mercenaries known as 'Vultures' roam the wasteland, exploiting the weak. The war's remnants plot to regain their lost power, targeting enhanced humans called 'Newtypes' to further their twisted ambitions.\n\nWhen Garrod is hired to rescue a kidnapped girl, he uncovers a sinister plot involving inhumane experiments on a powerful Newtype. Joined by Jamil Neate, a once-celebrated war hero, and Tiffa Adill, a Newtype herself, Garrod embarks on a perilous journey to save humanity from the brink of self-destruction. As the New United Nations Earth and the Space Revolutionary Army rebuild and regroup, the trio fights to prevent history from repeating itself in this thrilling tale of hope, redemption, and the indomitable human spirit.",
