  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shibuya, a bustling district overflowing with creative identity, brings together four young women seeking to rediscover their passions: illustrator Mahiru Kozuki, former idol Kano Yamanouchi, VTuber Kiui Watase, and composer Mei Kim Anouk Takanashi. In their youth, each faced hardships that led them to abandon their dreams - Mahiru gave up art after classmates mocked her work; Kano left her idol group due to scandal; Kiui retreated from content creation; and Mei turned away from music. Now, a chance encounter on Shibuya's vibrant streets at night sparks an ambitious vision - to form an anonymous artist collective called JELEE, where their complementary talents can shine. United by the desire to prove their individuality has value, the four set out to make JELEE a global phenomenon. The road ahead will force them to confront lingering doubts and anxieties. However, by leaning on one another as partners, they can rediscover long-lost passion and purpose. For the first time, their creative voices will ring out in unison - \"I want to find what I enjoy.\" If not as individuals but as \"we,\" they just might blaze a trail to stardom on their own terms.",
