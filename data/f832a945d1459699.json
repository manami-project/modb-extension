  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Korokichi's peaceful frog nation is plunged into chaos as aerial assaults rain down from a devilish country's floating platform. The attacks escalate as feline-esque creatures launch sea-plane offensives, prompting the courageous General Korokichi to retaliate with his trusty firearm. Nightfall only intensifies the onslaught, with submarine carriers deploying bombers, but the resilient frog forces counter with searchlight-guided anti-aircraft guns. Korokichi's exceptional leadership brings down enemy planes, only for him to awaken and discover it was all a dream. This riveting tale serves as a stark reminder of impending crisis, reflecting the real-life tensions between Japan and China on the brink of the Second Sino-Japanese War.",
