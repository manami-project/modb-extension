A young, compassionate elementary school girl named Nobuko discovers a weak, black kitten besieged by crows and decides to rescue it. Despite the food scarcity and her parents' initial reluctance, Nobuko's determination to keep the kitten prevails, and she eventually wins their approval. Named Kuro, the little cat brings delight and happiness to the family amidst the hardships of war. However, as the war's severity escalates, the family's ability to care for Kuro becomes increasingly difficult. Little do they know that Kuro's presence will play a significant role in Nobuko's life, especially when an unforeseen event unfolds.",
