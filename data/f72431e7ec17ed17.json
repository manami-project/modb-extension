  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 16th century Japan, the great warlord Oda Nobunaga stood before a statue of Buddha and joked that after his many sins, he would likely be reborn as a dog in his next life. To his surprise, he awakens as Shinamon, a Shiba Inu in modern-day Japan, still possessing his human memories and consciousness. Other prominent warriors like Takeda Shingen and Date Masamune have also been reincarnated as dogs. Though initially frustrated by his canine body and cute name, Nobunaga comes to enjoy certain aspects of being a pet. However, his ingrained samurai dignity makes behaviors like tail wagging difficult. In the park, the dog warriors reminisce about their past lives and debate whether Nobunaga's killer, Akechi Mitsuhide, was the true culprit. One day, Shinamon spots a young man bearing an uncanny resemblance to Mitsuhide. As the greatest warlords of Japan's Warring States era continue their rivalries in the modern world, Nobunaga hatches a new plan to confront his old nemesis.",
