  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Less than a moment after his betrayal and untimely death in 1582, the powerful warlord Oda Nobunaga finds himself reincarnated as a Shiba Inu named Shinamon in present-day Japan. With his human consciousness intact, Nobunaga grapples with the challenges and joys of being an adorable house pet, all while yearning for his days as a warlord.\n\nAs he adjusts to his new life, Nobunaga discovers that many of his fellow warriors have also been reincarnated as dogs, including his rivals. Together, they ponder the reasons behind their shared fate and the cultural differences between their previous lives and the modern world.\n\nBut the greatest mystery remains: Who betrayed Nobunaga, and what has become of his traitor? As the reincarnated samurai navigate their new lives at the dog park, Nobunaga becomes increasingly suspicious that his enemy may have been reborn as a human, free from the constraints of a canine body. Will Nobunaga uncover the truth, or will he forever remain a dog, bound by the whims of his new reality?",
