    "text": "For 500 years, the tyrannical Taboo Emperor Arthur Gaz ruled the Gaz Empire with cruelty, conducting inhumane experiments on his people. His reign ended five years ago when the Eight Heroes defeated him in battle. In the present day, Toru Acura is a former soldier struggling to adjust to peacetime living. When Toru and his sister Akari meet Chaika Trabant, a mysterious 14-year-old girl carrying a coffin, their lives are forever changed. Chaika reveals she is Emperor Gaz's daughter, searching to give her father a proper burial by gathering his scattered remains. Toru and Akari agree to help Chaika on her quest across the country. However, the Six Nations Council dispatches agents to pursue Chaika, threatening the peace between nations. With Chaika's shocking secret revealed, Toru and Akari must choose between aiding the late emperor's daughter or upholding postwar stability. Despite having no memories, Chaika adeptly wields powerful magic. As the unlikely trio journeys onward, they are unaware of the dangerous truth that awaits them.",
