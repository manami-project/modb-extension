    "text": "Second-year middle school student, Yuki, is a lonely and introverted boy who finds solace in writing down his observations and thoughts in his diary. His mundane life takes a dramatic turn when he discovers that his diary can predict the future for the next 90 days. The source of this newfound power is Deus Ex Machina, a being who claims to be the Lord of Time and Space. Deus enlists Yuki in a deadly survival game against other diary owners, each with their own unique prophetic devices, to determine the new god of space and time.\n\nYuki's life is further complicated when he becomes the target of a deranged classmate, and his only protection comes from Yuno, an obsessive stalker with her own psychic cell phone. As the game progresses, Yuki must navigate through a web of danger, deceit, and psychosis, with each player vying for the ultimate prize. With Yuno's maniacal protection, Yuki must use his diary to cheat death and emerge victorious in this twisted game of survival. Will Yuki be able to outsmart his opponents and become the new Lord of Time, or will he meet a gruesome end?",
