  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After inheriting an alien-hunting organization from their parents, siblings Yuuhi and Yuamu discover an extraterrestrial spaceship while searching for aliens in the forest near their hometown of Mutsuba-cho. Inside, they meet Yudias, an alien from the distant Velgear Star Cluster seeking knowledge of Rush Duel - a popular card game among local elementary students. Yudias believes mastering Rush Duel may save his war-torn home planet. However, having been exiled with his friends from their star system, he knows nothing of the game. Hoping to forge an unlikely friendship, Yuuhi offers to teach Yudias how to duel. As the siblings bond with this curious alien fan of Rush Duel, they wonder if their fated first contact hides a deeper purpose. Perhaps Yudias' arrival is more than just a cosmic coincidence.",
