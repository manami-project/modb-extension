    "text": "Meyer and her enigmatic older brother, Edgar, disrupt the routine of four immortal bounty hunters—Kate, Claire, Rose, and Rachel—who lead double lives as high school students in a dystopian New York City. Known as the Dead Girls, they share a mysterious connection to Roosevelt Island's Red Garden, a place of dark legends and monstrous inhabitants.\n\nAs these new transfer students infiltrate the girls' circle, the past resurfaces, forcing the Dead Girls to confront their origins and the enigmatic forces that bind them. The Red Garden, both a sanctuary and a curse, becomes the stage for a dangerous encounter that will test their strength and unity.\n\nIn a world where immortality and adolescence collide, the Dead Girls must navigate the challenges of school life and the perils of their supernatural existence. As they unravel the motives behind the sudden appearance of Lise Harriette Meyer and her brother, they must also face the deadly enemies that emerge from the shadows of their own past.",
