  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earth becomes the battleground for a group of five teenagers with extraordinary psychic abilities, as they face off against a malevolent alien force in the form of the Golteus reptile army. At the heart of the conflict is Yuuji, an American football player who is unwittingly thrust into the chaos when his father, Professor Katou, the head of space engineering, is kidnapped by the extraterrestrial invaders.\n\nIn response to the alien attack, a mysterious spaceship lands on a serene lake, prompting four young psychics – Mark, Dickey, Franco, and Yuri – to take action. Believing that their only hope lies in the transforming robot Baratack, they use their psychic powers to kidnap Yuuji, the professor's second son, who was oblivious to the events unfolding around him.\n\nBaratack, a seemingly unstoppable force, can only be activated when the combined powers of Yuuji and the other four psychics merge as one. As they unite and cry out \"Pentagoras Unite!\", the mighty robot emerges, igniting a fierce determination within Yuuji to vanquish the alien foes and rescue his father.\n\nWill Yuuji and his newfound allies be able to harness the power of Baratack and save Earth from the clutches of the Golteus reptile army? Join them on their thrilling adventure as they fight to protect humanity and restore peace to the universe.",
