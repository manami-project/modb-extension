  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in Tokyo during the Taisho era of Japan (1912-1926), \"Haikara-san ga Tooru\" tells the story of the unconventional Benio \"Haikara-san\" Hanamura. Having lost her mother at a young age, Haikara-san was raised solely by her father, a high-ranking official in the Japanese army. As a result, she grew up as a tomboy who defies traditional Japanese gender roles of the time - studying kendo, wearing Western fashions, drinking sake, and prioritizing literature and women's rights over housework. Haikara-san's best friends are Tamaki, a beautiful girl who shares her progressive views on women's rights, and Ranmaru, a young man raised in kabuki theater to play female roles leading him to have very effeminate mannerisms. Despite her unladylike upbringing, Haikara-san's family arranges for her to marry Shinobu IjÅ«in, a second lieutenant in the army. The story follows the 17-year-old Haikara-san in 1918 as she attempts to balance her friendships, impending marriage, family obligations and her own views on love and independence. Her boisterous, adventurous spirit is tested during a time period of great social change and wartime in Japan.",
