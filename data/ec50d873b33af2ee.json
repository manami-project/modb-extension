  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's no ordinary girl of her time - meet Benio 'Haikara-san' Hanamura, a spirited 17-year-old living in Tokyo during the Taisho era. Raised by her high-ranking military officer father after losing her mother at a young age, Benio defies the traditional expectations of Japanese femininity. Instead of mastering housework and donning kimonos, she's more likely to be found wielding a kendo sword, sipping sake, or sporting Western attire.\n\nBenio's rebellious spirit extends to matters of the heart, as she rejects the notion of arranged marriages and champions a woman's right to pursue a career and marry for love. Alongside her best friends, the elegant yet equally progressive Tamaki and the effeminate kabuki actor Ranmaru, Benio embarks on thrilling escapades that often involve climbing trees and challenging societal norms.\n\nDespite her family's plans for her betrothal to Shinobu IjÅ«in, a second lieutenant in the army, Benio remains resolute in her quest to find love on her own terms. As the world around her grapples with the onset of war, Benio must navigate the trials of love, independence, and friendship in this captivating tale of a young woman ahead of her time.",
