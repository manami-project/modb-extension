  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kobato is a kind-hearted and cheerful girl who came to Earth from another world on a special mission. She must fill a bottle with candy-like \"konpeito,\" which are produced when she heals the scarred heart of a suffering person. Kobato has a sincere desire to help people, and her sweet personality allows her to connect with and mend the hearts of those she encounters. However, Kobato must complete her mission within a limited time, and she cannot fall in love in the process. As she strives to heal hearts, she is aided by a hot-tempered stuffed animal named Ioryogi, who guides and scores her efforts. Despite the constraints of her task, Kobato brightens the lives of people struggling with pain, conflict, or loss through her empathy, wisdom and optimism. Ultimately, once Kobato's bottle is filled, her selfless wish will be granted: to travel to a deeply meaningful place.",
