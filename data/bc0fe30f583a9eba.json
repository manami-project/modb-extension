    "text": "One late transfer to Haneoka Girls' Academy, Anon, finds herself in a unique school culture where girl bands reign supreme. Desperate to fit in and form her own band, Anon sets her sights on the school's eccentric outcast, Tomori, who has yet to join any band. Despite Tomori's reluctance and past wounds from her previous band experience, Anon remains determined to win her over and discover the true power of friendship and music. As the spring semester draws to a close, Anon's dream of forming a band hangs in the balance, but she's ready to face the challenges head-on and find her place in this musical world.",
