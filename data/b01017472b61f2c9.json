  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sousukeâ€™s mission to protect Kaname Chidori is abruptly terminated by Mithril, leaving her vulnerable and alone. Meanwhile, a clandestine organization known as Amalgam emerges with technology that can neutralize the Electronic Cloaking System (ECS) mode. Amalgam, led by a deranged individual named Gates, possesses 'Black Technology' derived from 'Whispered' individuals like Kaname, and they are eager to acquire more.\n\nAs Mithril grapples with this new threat, Sousuke finds himself struggling with his own inner demons. He is unable to fully control the Lambda Driver, and the revelation that Amalgam's mechas also possess this technology only adds to his troubles. With Kaname's life hanging in the balance, Sousuke is unable to intervene, causing him to withdraw further from his mission.\n\nSet two months after the events on the Tuatha de Danaan, this season of \"Full Metal Panic!\" returns to its roots with a new wave of terrorism, intense action, and heart-wrenching moments for Sousuke, Kaname, and their friends. As the stakes rise and the danger escalates, will Sousuke and Mithril be able to overcome their challenges and protect Kaname from the looming threat of Amalgam?",
