  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuki-jinja Shrine, located in the mountain village of Kurama in Kyoto, is home to an annual fire festival that brings together people, gods, and spirits in a dazzling celebration. This imaginative anime film from 2017 documents the festival while also weaving in fantastical elements about the various participants who make it happen. We follow the shrine keepers as they make offerings and preparations to honor the deities. Local villagers, brimming with excitement, don colorful robes and masks to perform ritual dances passed down through generations. Mischievous spirits emerge from the forest to join in the revelry. The film captures not just the spectacle of the fire festival, but also the community spirit behind this magical tradition. Blending documentary realism with flights of fantasy, it promises to be a visually thrilling and culturally enlightening look at a one-of-a-kind event.",
