  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After abruptly quitting his office job, Keiichirou Tachibana decides to open a bakery called Antique. As he reviews applications for a head patissier, Tachibana comes across a familiar name - Yuusuke Ono, a talented chef who once confessed his feelings to a young Tachibana back in high school. Though Tachibana had harshly rejected Ono's advances years ago, he decides to hire the now openly gay Ono due to his exceptional skills. Ono joins Tachibana's team along with Eiji Kanda, a retired champion boxer pursuing a new career after an injury. Though the bakery gets off to a strong start, tensions simmer between Tachibana and Ono over their shared past. As the employees cope with troubles from their former lives, the success of Antique depends on whether this unlikely group can overcome their personal demons and bond together over their common passion for baking.",
