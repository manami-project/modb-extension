    "text": "After an unexpected incident, the genius but interpersonally challenged engineer, Appare Sorano, and the cunning yet timid samurai, Kosame Isshiki, find themselves stranded on a boat from Japan to America with no funds. In a bid to earn enough money to return home, they enter the Trans-America Wild Race, a competition filled with eccentric rivals, outlaws, and natural obstacles. The duo navigates the wild West from Los Angeles to New York in their self-constructed steam-powered vehicle, hoping to claim the prize money and make their way back to Japan. The journey begins in the late 19th century, promising an adventure of a lifetime.",
