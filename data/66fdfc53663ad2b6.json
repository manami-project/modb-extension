  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Legend ary warrior Yuko Asou, a seemingly ordinary Japanese student from the late 1980s, is entrusted with the mystical sword Valis and becomes the protector of three distinct realms: the physical world, the ethereal Spirit world, and the dreamlike Vecanti. This thrilling tale unfolds in the Mugen Senshi Valis, a popular Japanese platform game series developed by Telenet Japan. The captivating saga of Valis spans multiple games released between 1986 and 1993, as well as a four-volume manga series that concluded in March 2012. To celebrate the release of the first Famicom game, a unique 3-minute promotional anime was created, serving as more than just a commercial. This engaging short film condenses the game's story, even revealing its most shocking twist, leaving viewers eager to dive into the immersive world of Valis.",
