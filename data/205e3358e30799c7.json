    "text": "British Library's hidden secret society of mages, the College, extends an invitation to apprentice mage Chise Hatori, offering her a chance to hone her magical skills and find a way to remove the curses that plague her. Despite her groom and mentor Elias Ainsworth's hesitation, Chise embraces the opportunity, hoping it will help her overcome her self-sacrificing tendencies. As she navigates through the College, Chise captivates her classmates and professors with her unique abilities, but she soon realizes that not everyone has her best interests at heart. In this new chapter of her life, Chise must discern friends from foes and confront the sinister forces lurking within the College, all while continuing to accept herself and Elias in a world where her past still haunts her.",
