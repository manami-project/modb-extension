    "text": "Two parallel universes, oblivious of each other's existence, are locked in a relentless battle for survival, hinging on the dwindling resource of mana. In the fading world of Sylvarant, the last beacon of hope lies in the Chosen of Martel, Colette Brunel. Embarking on the daunting Journey of World Regeneration, Colette, accompanied by her steadfast friends Lloyd Irving and Genis Sage, along with a seasoned mercenary named Kratos and the wise half-elf teacher Raine, must awaken the slumbering Summon Spirits and vanquish the Desians to restore the world's mana. As they traverse the land, the group uncovers the hidden truth behind the World Regeneration, forging new friendships and facing formidable adversaries along the way. The journey promises not only the renewal of their world but also the transformation of Colette into an angel, leaving her mortal life behind. Will they succeed in rejuvenating their dying world, or will the truth behind their quest prove too much to bear?",
