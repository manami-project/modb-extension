  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jing is a young, bright-eyed thief with remarkable skills that allow him to steal anything, regardless of security measures in place. He travels from town to town with his partner Kir, a wisecracking, girl-crazy bird who can transform into a deadly weapon called the Kir Royale when needed. Together, they seek out and steal the greatest treasures, from desert bandit fortresses to the inner chambers of royalty. Jing can infiltrate anywhere and escape capture even when up against impossible odds. His exploits have earned him the legendary title of \"King of Bandits\" yet strangely, no one seems to recognize his face. The mysterious Postino also shows up conveniently on his motorcycle with helpful information for Jing at just the right moments. Wherever there are magnificent treasures to uncover, you can be sure the King of Bandits and his feathered friend won't be far behind, ready to use their skills to liberate them into their own possession.",
