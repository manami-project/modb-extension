  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Atom—the world's first android with a human heart—was created by the brilliant but grief-stricken Professor Tenma, who had lost his son Tobio in a tragic car accident. Designed as a replica of his late son, Atom was ultimately abandoned by his creator, who couldn't bear the android's inability to age.\n\nEnter Professor Ochanomizu, a dedicated scientist who discovers Atom and reactivates him, determined not to let this groundbreaking achievement in artificial intelligence go to waste. Despite his childlike appearance, Atom possesses extraordinary strength, intelligence, and a deep sense of compassion that rivals that of any human.\n\nIn a world where robots are viewed as mere tools and potential threats, Atom faces prejudice and rejection. However, he dreams of a harmonious coexistence between humans and robots, and sets out to protect both, often serving as a mediator between the two. As a superhero and a 6th grade student, Atom navigates through life, dealing with the challenges of racism and uncovering the truth about his enigmatic creator. With his unwavering pursuit of justice and peace, Atom strives to inspire genuine bonds between humans and robots, proving that he is more human than machine.",
