    "text": "Tokiko Mima, nicknamed \"Key\", is a robot girl created by scientist Dr. Murao Mima to resemble a human. After Dr. Mima's death, Key finds a message from him stating that she can become human if she makes 30,000 friends. Seeking to fulfill this goal, Key moves to Tokyo where she reconnects with her childhood friend Sakura Kuriyagawa. There, Key develops an interest in becoming a pop idol singer after becoming enamored with famous idol Miho Utsuse. However, Miho has a connection to Jinsaku Ajou, Dr. Mima's old rival seeking to make a breakthrough in weaponized robotics. As Key works to make friends and inch closer to humanity, she gets caught up in a dangerous plan set in motion by Ajou. It seems there are still mysteries surrounding Key's true origins and purpose. To attain her dream, she must navigate complex relationships, the entertainment industry, and sinister forces plotting in the shadows.",
