    "text": "In September 1944, the Allied Forces score a major victory against the mysterious alien invaders known as the Neuroi. Thanks to the efforts of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing \"Strike Witches\", the Neuroi nest above Gallia is destroyed, securing western Europe. Bolstered by this triumph, the Allies set their sights on liberating central and eastern Europe from the Neuroi scourge. The 502nd Joint Fighter Wing \"Brave Witches\" stands ready to deploy from their base in Petersburg, Orussia. Though young and inexperienced, these courageous Witches carry mankind's hopes on their shoulders as they take to the icy skies over eastern Europe. Among the Brave Witches is Hikari Karibuchi, who joins after her sister is injured en route to the squadron. Lacking any magical abilities, Hikari doubts her ability to serve alongside her gifted comrades. Yet she remains determined to prove herself in combat against the alien invaders. By fighting alongside the rest of the 502nd, Hikari aims to show that she deserves to be called a Witch.",
