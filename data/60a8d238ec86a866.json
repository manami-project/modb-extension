  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Prince Anisphia, a seemingly foolish royal, harbors a hidden genius for magic and a dream to soar through the skies, despite her inability to wield traditional magic. Drawing on her past-life memories and defying societal norms, she develops 'magicology,' a groundbreaking magical theory. When the virtuoso noblewoman Euphyllia is wrongfully robbed of her title as the kingdom's future monarch, Anisphia takes it upon herself to restore Euphyllia's reputation.\n\nTheir worlds collide during a test flight of Anisphia's 'witch's broom,' leading to an unexpected partnership. Together, they delve into the secrets of magic, facing dangers and political machinations that threaten the kingdom. As they navigate their unique paths, their alliance will not only reshape their destinies but also the fate of the entire world.\n\nMeanwhile, Prince Algard, Anisphia's younger brother and the heir apparent, finds himself entangled in a political marriage with Euphyllia. Rebelling against the arrangement, he publicly dissolves the engagement, causing further upheaval in the kingdom. As the stakes rise, the intertwined fates of these strong-willed women promise to bring about change and challenge the very foundations of their world.",
