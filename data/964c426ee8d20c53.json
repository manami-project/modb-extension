  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mushishi Ginko embarks on a perilous journey to an abandoned village teeming with mysterious life forms known as Mushi, as depicted in the unaired special episode 'Path of Thorns.' Initially broadcast on August 20, 2014, and later included with the anime's third Blu-ray/DVD volume, this tale delves into the enigmatic Minai clan, who are sworn protectors of the Karibusa family and their ancient secret.\n\nThe Mushi possess unfathomable powers that defy the natural order, capable of resurrecting decaying wood and deserted houses into thriving flora. Tanyuu Karibusa enlists Ginko's expertise to monitor the Minai clan's head, Kumado Minai, as they venture into the treacherous depths where Mushi emerge from obscure origins.\n\nThe Minai clan, typically apathetic towards beauty and emotions, display an uncharacteristic ruthlessness in their pursuit. Tanyuu suspects hidden motives behind their behavior, prompting Ginko to unravel the truth. As they traverse the 'Path of Thorns,' they encounter rare and deadly Mushi species that threaten to blur the boundaries between humans and these ethereal beings, potentially upending the very fabric of existence.",
