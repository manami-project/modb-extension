  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around mysterious creatures called Mushi that lie behind many strange natural phenomena. Long ago, a powerful and dangerous Mushi was sealed away by the Minai clan, who serve as retainers to the Karibusa family. In this special episode, the Mushishi (Mushi master) Ginko is hired by Tanyuu Karibusa to oversee the investigation of an abandoned village by Kumado Minai, the head of the Minai clan. Though known for being ruthless, the Minai clan members share an odd, dull character. Tanyuu suspects there's more to this than meets the eye. As Ginko follows Kumado into the 'Path of Thorns,' he aims to uncover the secret behind the Minai clan's dedication to their duty. Within the dangerous depths lurk rare and lethal Mushi, as well as answers about the true nature of the clan's resolve. This unaired episode adapts the 'Odoro no Michi' chapters of the manga, providing backstory on the Minai clan and their connection to the sealed Mushi. It offers insight into this mysterious world where the boundary between man and Mushi is perilously thin.",
