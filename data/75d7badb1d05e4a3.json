    "text": "Hare's life in a tranquil jungle village with his mother, Weda, takes a dramatic turn when an enigmatic girl named Guu joins their household. Once content with his simple life, Hare now finds himself burdened with the responsibility of managing Guu's eccentricities and supernatural abilities. Guu, with her dual personalities – one sweet and endearing, the other mischievous and sarcastic – has a peculiar appetite for swallowing objects and people whole, turning her stomach into a bizarre universe of its own. Hare, the only one who can perceive Guu's true nature, must navigate through a series of wild adventures while trying to maintain a semblance of normalcy in his life. As Guu's antics continuously push Hare's limits, he strives to protect those around him from the unpredictable chaos that Guu brings.",
