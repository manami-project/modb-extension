    "text": "With a new school comes new challenges, and for Takisawa Noboru, those challenges are about to get physical at Honjakuniku High School. Here, disagreements are resolved through fists, not words. Noboru's first day starts off on the wrong foot when he's reprimanded for tardiness by the zealous hall monitor, Jonoichi Yukari. But things take a turn for the worse when he finds himself in the crosshairs of the school's reigning champion, Ibuki Saburo. To win the affection of the captivating Takamura Yukari and secure his place in the school hierarchy, Noboru must face off against Ibuki in a series of high-stakes boxing matches. Will Noboru's determination and grit be enough to outmatch Ibuki's brawn, or will he crumble under the pressure? Only time will tell in this thrilling tale of love, honor, and the ultimate test of strength.",
