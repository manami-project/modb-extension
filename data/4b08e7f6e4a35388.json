  "synopsis": {
    "text": "John Estes, known as Mad Bull, is a ruthless and unconventional cop in New York City's toughest district, the 34th Precinct. With a penchant for dispensing his own brand of justice, Mad Bull's methods often blur the line between right and wrong, leaving his partner, Daizaburo Edi-Ban, a Japanese-American rookie, questioning his actions. Despite his questionable tactics, Mad Bull always has a hidden agenda, using stolen funds to support worthy causes like a clinic for venereal diseases and a shelter for abused women. Together with Lieutenant Perrine Valley, the trio takes on the city's most dangerous criminals, from petty thieves to powerful mafia bosses. Inspired by high-action buddy cop films of the '70s and '80s, this anime delves into the gritty world of crime and corruption, exploring the complexities of justice and the true meaning of being a hero.",
