    "text": "That first snowfall sets the stage for a heartwarming trilogy of commercials for Dunlop Tyres Japan's Winter Maxx tire line. In \"Kimi e to Tsuzuku Michi,\" a father and daughter, a young couple, and two coworkers navigate their complex emotions as they gather for a picturesque light show by the river. \"Hoshifuru Oka no Yakusoku\" follows Yui, a college student, as she and her mother visit an observatory on her 20th birthday, a trip that stirs up cherished memories of her late father. Lastly, \"Kioku ni Mau Konayuki\" tells the bittersweet tale of two young lovers separated by a move to France, prompting the boy to chase after his departing love amidst a snowstorm. This trilogy beautifully captures the essence of love, loss, and memories, all set against the backdrop of a serene winter landscape.",
