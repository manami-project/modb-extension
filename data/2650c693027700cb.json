    "text": "It's a typical day for the unremarkable middle schooler, Tatara Fujita, who's been aimlessly navigating through life, struggling to find his passion. His mundane existence is punctuated by encounters with local bullies who exploit his vulnerability, extorting money from him. But his life takes a dramatic turn when a charismatic stranger, Kaname Sengoku, intervenes and rescues him from the bullies.\n\nSengoku isn't just any ordinary hero; he's a professional ballroom dancer. Intrigued by Sengoku's enigmatic charm, Fujita reluctantly accepts an invitation to his dance studio. Here, he encounters Shizuku Hanaoka, a mesmerizing dance prodigy, and the world of competitive dance.\n\nInitially hesitant, Fujita finds himself drawn to the vibrant and thrilling world of dance, a realm far removed from his ordinary life. The allure of the spotlight, the thrill of competition, and the chance to excel at something ignite a spark within him. As he embarks on this journey, Fujita discovers a newfound passion that promises to transform his life forever.",
