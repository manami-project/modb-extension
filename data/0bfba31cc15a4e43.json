  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rahzel is a young, clever, and confident girl who is kicked out of her wealthy family's home by her father, with the instruction to \"see the world.\" As she begins her journey of discovery, she meets two very different men, Alzeid and Heat, who end up joining her. Alzeid is a stoic, serious young man seeking revenge for his father's murder. Heat is more lighthearted and lecherous. Though very different, Rahzel feels drawn to both of them, perhaps due to an attraction or their shared magical powers. Together, the reluctant allies travel from town to town, using their magic to help people in need. Along the way, they have various adventures and meet new friends and enemies. Their journey is one of self-discovery as they find their place in the world. Despite their differences, the three companions form a close bond.",
