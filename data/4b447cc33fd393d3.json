    "text": "Demi-Human Alliance, led by the formidable Demon Emperor Jaldabaoth, threatens to shatter the tranquility of the Roebel Sacred Kingdom, a land that has flourished behind its impenetrable walls under the guidance of Sacred Queen Calca. Desperate to save their kingdom from imminent collapse, the grandmaster of the Sacred Paladin Order, Remedios, and the high priestess, Kelart, rally their forces but find themselves outmatched by Jaldabaoth's overwhelming power.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Momonga, an avid gamer, finds himself trapped within his favorite MMORPG game as his avatar, the Sorcerer King Ains Ooal Gown. With the neighboring Slane Theocracy fearing an invasion, they seek help from their unlikely allies - the Sorcerer Kingdom ruled by the undead Momonga.\n\nIn a battle that transcends the boundaries of the game world and reality, the Sorcerer King Ains Ooal Gown leads his undead army alongside the forces of the Sacred Kingdom and the Slane Theocracy. Their collective hope rests on defeating the Demon Emperor and restoring peace to the embattled lands. As taboos are broken and alliances are forged, the future of the Sacred Kingdom hangs in the balance.",
