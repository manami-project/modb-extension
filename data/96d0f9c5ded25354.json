  "synopsis": {
    "text": "What awaits Captain Harlock upon his return from a distant galactic war is an Earth far removed from his memories, now under the iron grip of the alien Illumidus Empire. As humanity suffers under their oppressive rule, a beacon of hope persists in the form of a mysterious voice known as 'The Rose,' who is none other than Harlock's former love, Maya. Teaming up with a stranger-turned-brother, Tochiro Oyama, and inspired by Maya's messages, Harlock embarks on a mission to liberate Earth, drawing parallels with Japan's post-WWII struggles. Alongside a group of loyal allies, Harlock adopts the tactics of ancient marauders, transforming his battle cruiser into a symbol of rebellion against the Illumidus Empire, no matter the cost to himself or his crew. As the fight for freedom unfolds, the spaceship Arcadia becomes their shared hope, carrying the legacy of a scarred Japanese pilot from WWII and a promise for a better future.",
