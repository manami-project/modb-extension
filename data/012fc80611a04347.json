  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Centuries ago, an asteroid collision plunged Earth into apocalypse. To survive, humanity split into two groups - the aristocratic Dobias headed into space, while the earthy Shioru went underground. 300 years later, both groups returned to find Earth drastically changed. Monstrous predators called Siliconians now roam the land. As Dobias and Shioru fight bitterly over dwindling resources, a new threat emerges. The Siliconians are evolving, becoming smarter and more dangerous. In this desperate time, an elite fighting force called the Geisters stands as humanity's last hope. With extraordinary abilities powered by advanced technology, they wage war against the Siliconians. But the Geisters also strive for peace between the warring human factions. Recently, a fierce Shioru warrior named Shai joined their ranks. Her bold personality causes friction, but her skills make her invaluable. As political tensions and Siliconian attacks escalate, the Geisters must overcome their differences to defend mankind. The future remains uncertain, but one thing is clear - united we stand, divided we fall.",
