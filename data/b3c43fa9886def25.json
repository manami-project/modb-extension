Student council secretary Yuu Ishigami eagerly awaits this weekly escape, counting down the minutes until he can indulge in reading the latest chapter of his favorite seinen manga series, \"Momo Doesn't Think.\" Little does Ishigami know, he has company in his guilty pleasure. Student council president Miyuki Shirogane secretly shares Ishigami's passion for the manga. So when news breaks of an upcoming third anime adaptation, Shirogane can barely contain his excitement. The two manage to keep their hobby hidden from vice president Kaguya Shinomiya. But Shirogane lives in fear that his embarrassing otaku interests will someday come to light. In a school where reputation means everything, the threat of being outed as an otaku keeps Shirogane on edge. He goes to absurd lengths to guard his secret double life. Will Shirogane's efforts be enough to prevent his precious after-school ritual from being disrupted? Can he protect his image while indulging a passion he shares with the unlikeliest of allies? This comedy anime promises hilarious antics and endearing bonds as the student council navigates school life, romance, and their hidden obsessions.",
