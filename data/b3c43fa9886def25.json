  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuu Ishigami, the secretary of Shuchiin Academy's student council, spends every Thursday anxiously awaiting his escape to the student council chamber to indulge in his favorite pastime: reading the latest chapter of the popular seinen manga, 'Momo Doesn't Think.' Accompanying him in this weekly ritual is student council president Miyuki Shirogane, who shares Ishigami's enthusiasm for the series, especially upon hearing the news of a third season of the anime adaptation. However, the pair's secret hobby is under threat of being exposed when vice president Kaguya Shinomiya begins to suspect what has been captivating the two boys. Desperate to avoid being labeled an otaku, Shirogane goes to great lengths to keep his love for the series a secret. This teaser is based on chapter 110 of the manga and serves as a preview for the highly anticipated third season of Kaguya-sama wa Kokurasetai: Ultra Romantic, set to be released in April 2022.",
