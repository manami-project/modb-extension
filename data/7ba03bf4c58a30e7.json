  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the monotonous life of 38-year-old office worker Taichi Tanaka, the virtual world of \"One More Free Life Online\" offers an exhilarating escape. Unlike most gamers who thirst for adventure and combat, Taichi's character, Earth, is an extraordinary chef and potion-maker, using bizarre self-made weapons to gather ingredients from defeated monsters. His unconventional choice of skills might seem absurd to some, but for Taichi, it's all about enjoying the game his way. As he embarks on this fantastical journey, will he remain a lone wolf, or will fellow gamers join him in his culinary adventures? Join Taichi as he redefines what it means to live a virtual life to the fullest.",
