  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This OVA episode offers a glimpse into the daily lives of Basara and his housemates Mio, Maria, and Yuki. It begins with the playful succubus Maria causing her usual mischief and misunderstandings between Basara and Mio. Despite these antics, Yuki remains unperturbed. At school, Basara continues finding himself in awkward situations, eventually ending up in the infirmary with the school nurse. Later, Maria starts planning a birthday celebration for Mio, likely involving more of her signature meddling. Based on the information provided, this OVA seems to be a humorous, slice-of-life interlude focusing on the dynamics between these characters. Maria's scheming suggests this birthday party may take an ecchi turn. While little overarching plot progression is indicated, this special episode promises fans moments of levity with the characters they love.",
