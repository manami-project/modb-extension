  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a fantasy world, powerful beings known as the Heavenly Beings invaded planets across the universe to steal a vital energy called Akuto. Drunk on this unlimited power, they created a floating island utopia in the sky. However, they feared running out of stars to supply their energy needs and decided to revive humanity to live alongside them and produce more Akuto. But the humans did not produce enough, so the Heavenly Beings focused efforts on conquering more worlds, heedless of the looming Akuto crisis. On Earth, a young girl named Yumemi is the only one able to see the Heavenly Beings' islands floating in the sky. When the king of the magic kingdom, Munto, appears before Yumemi, he implores her help in restoring the flow of Akuto to save both his world and hers. Though at first reluctant, Yumemi comes to terms with her responsibility and unique role in determining the fate of two worlds.",
