  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In present-day Seoul, college student Hye-Mi crosses paths with a most unusual love interest - a coffee vending machine named Jin. This is no ordinary vending machine, however. Jin was once a legendary samurai warrior in feudal Japan who, after falling to assassins, wished to be reborn with an invincible steel body. Due to some twist of fate, his wish was granted in an unexpected way, and he reincarnated as a vending machine in modern-day Korea. Though now trapped in a mechanical body, Jin retains his skills as a fighter. He continues to engage in battles with warrior rivals from his past life who have also been reincarnated in odd forms. All the while, an endearing bond blossoms between Jin and Hye-Mi, despite the vast differences in their outward appearances. Can true love conquer all, even the barrier between woman and machine? This inventive anime provides a delightfully offbeat backdrop to explore the timeless themes of identity, fate, and star-crossed romance.",
