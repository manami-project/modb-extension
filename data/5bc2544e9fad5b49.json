  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime, set in the student council room of Shuchiin Academy, follows the love story of two geniuses, Vice President Kaguya Shinomiya and President Miyuki Shirogane. After a long battle of wits and emotions, the pair shared their first kiss at the Hoshin Festival, but a clear confession of love remained elusive. As their relationship status remains ambiguous, they become increasingly conscious of their feelings for each other. Their biggest challenge yet arrives with the Christmas season, as Shirogane strives for perfection while Kaguya embraces imperfection. This \"normal\" love story of two geniuses revolves around their first kiss that never seems to end. Originally premiered in Japanese theaters on December 17, 2022, the anime was later released as four episodes on TV, streaming, and Blu-Ray/DVD.",
