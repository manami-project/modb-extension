  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Five years ago, young Daiya Tsuwabuki and his father were attacked by giant monsters while on a fishing trip, resulting in his father's disappearance. Though Daiya claimed they were real, no one believed him. Now in the present day, monsters have begun attacking Daiya's hometown. During one attack, he encounters a giant mecha dragon called Daiku Maryu and its transformable robot warrior, Gaiking. Daiya becomes Gaiking's pilot and joins Daiku Maryu's crew on a mission to travel to the underground world of Darius. Their goals are to find Daiya's missing father, defeat the source of the monsters, and stop the Darius Emperor from using the monsters to conquer the surface world. Along the way, Daiya must harness his skills as Gaiking's pilot to protect his friends and home from swarms of invading beasts. Will Daiya finally prove the existence of the monsters that took his father, and can he and Daiku Maryu's crew avert disaster for both worlds?",
