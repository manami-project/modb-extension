  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rebecca is a cheerful and energetic 10-year-old girl living in rural Maine in the late 19th century. As the second of seven children, her life is turned upside down when her father passes away, plunging the family into poverty. She is sent to live with her Aunt Miranda and Aunt Jane, sisters with vastly different personalities. While Rebecca adores the gentle kindness of Aunt Jane, she shrinks under the strict nagging of Aunt Miranda. One day, Miranda scolds Rebecca for wearing a handmade pink dress from Jane without permission. When Miranda makes callous comments about Rebecca's deceased father, Rebecca finally snaps. Overflowing with hurt and anger, she runs away from the house in tears. Originally planned as part of Anime Tamago 2020 with a screening on March 14th, the event was cancelled due to COVID-19 concerns. But Rebecca's story continues on, one of hardship, loss, and learning to find beauty again even in life's darkest moments.",
