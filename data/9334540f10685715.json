    "text": "While normalcy returns after the intense Sakura Card Arc and the battle at Tokyo Tower, Sakura finds herself grappling with a different kind of challenge. With all Clow Cards, including The Dark and The Light, finally in her possession, she now faces the emotional turmoil of bidding farewell to dear friends. Eriol departs for England, and Syaoran reveals his true feelings before leaving for Hong Kong. Amidst these emotional goodbyes, Sakura, encouraged by her best friend Tomoyo, embarks on a journey of self-discovery to unravel her true feelings and create a special gift for someone close to her heart. This heartwarming tale, originally presented in episode 70 of Cardcaptor Sakura, is a testament to the power of friendship and love.",
