  "synopsis": {
    "text": "These five friends, once part of an animation club in high school, shared a dream: to make it big in the anime industry and collaborate on a professional project together. After their first amateur production was showcased at a cultural festival, the dream only grew stronger. Two years down the line, Aoi and Ema have managed to secure jobs at a renowned animation studio, Musashino Animation. However, the reality of the industry is far from what they had imagined. Aoi, as a production assistant, grapples with a demanding schedule, while Ema puts in long hours as a key animator. Meanwhile, their other friends are navigating their own challenges: Shizuka, aspiring to be a voice actor, is stuck waiting tables; Misa has transitioned from 2D to 3D animation and works in computer graphics; and Midori, the hopeful screenwriter, is still searching for her first big break. Despite the hurdles, they're not ready to abandon their dreams just yet. The journey to success in the anime industry is fraught with challenges, but these five friends are determined to persevere and make their dreams a reality in SHIROBAKO.",
