  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in an alternate Meiji Era, Sakamoto Ryunosuke returns home to Kyoto after studying abroad in Shanghai, accompanied by his monster friend Nekomaru. With the government pushing modernization, laws now require monsters to be licensed to freely live alongside humans. The Kidou Shinsengumi Co. Ltd, run by Ryunosuke's father, is tasked with capturing unlicensed monsters. However, they face opposition from the Tsubamegumi, who believe the new monster laws are unjust. Though part of a distinguished family, Ryunosuke finds the Shinsengumi Co. heavily in debt. As he strives to aid the business, he must also contend with Tsubamegumi resistance, monster attacks, meddling matchmakers trying to set him up with a local restaurant owner's daughter, and more. Between facing threats like an angry giant Kappa seeking revenge and fending off aggressive moneylenders, Ryunosuke has his work cut out for him. Will he successfully overcome these obstacles and help his family's company back to prosperity? Or will the mounting troubles bury the Shinsengumi Co. in even greater financial ruin?",
