    "text": "Aron, a boy from the distant planet Pokkuru, interrupts Doraemon, Nobita, and their friends during a film shoot where they're pretending to be space heroes. Aron seeks their help to save his home planet from a formidable alien invasion. Inspired by Nobita's desire to become a real hero, Doraemon employs his futuristic gadget, the Burger Director, to transform the group into genuine superheroes.\n\nAs they embark on their mission, the team soon discovers that the perils they face are not part of a movie script but actual threats. Doraemon, Nobita, and their friends must now band together and utilize their newfound powers to rescue Aron's planet from the clutches of menacing space pirates. This thrilling adventure, based on the 1982 classic Doraemon film, promises to bring the excitement of outer space heroics to life.",
