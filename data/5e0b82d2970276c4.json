    "text": "Crimson Goddess is an OVA that takes us back to the formative years of the Glass no Kamen series, introducing us to Maya Kitajima, a young girl with a humble background and an extraordinary passion for movies, theatrical plays, and TV dramas. Despite her struggles to be of help at school or her mother's restaurant, Maya's uncanny ability to remember every line from a movie she's seen once and her flair for acting out stories captivate the attention of a scarred, older woman named Chigusa Tsukikage.\n\nChigusa, once a celebrated actress, now spends her days protecting the rights to a legendary play, searching for the perfect young woman to perform it. In Maya, she sees potential and takes her under her wing, despite the girl's mother's disapproval. Maya's journey into acting begins with a school production, where she lands the role of Bibi, a sad and pitiful character. Seeking guidance from a mysterious woman, Maya learns to embrace her character and discovers her true passion for the stage.\n\nWith newfound determination, Maya embarks on a quest to become a great actress, one worthy of playing the Crimson Goddess. However, her path is not without challenges, as she faces stiff competition from Ayumi, a famous and talented rival. Will Maya's passion and dedication be enough to propel her to greatness and secure her place as the legendary play's leading actress? Only time will tell.",
