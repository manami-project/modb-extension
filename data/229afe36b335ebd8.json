    "text": "Also known as the Three Aspects, Genjo Sanzo, Cho Hakkai, Son Goku, and Sa Gojo have reached the distant land of India, where the evil that caused the Yokai to rampage in Shangri-La is believed to have originated. As they journey west to put an end to Gyumaoh's resurrection experiments, the source of all the chaos on the continent, they encounter increasingly intense battles and the influence of the Calamity becomes more pronounced. In this foreign land where humans and yokai coexist with science and magic, what fate awaits the Sanzo party at the end of their perilous journey, and will they be able to stop the resurrection of the Ox Demon King?",
