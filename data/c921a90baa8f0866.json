  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fate/school life takes center stage in this comedic spin-off, based on Eiichirou Mashin's manga, Himuro no Tenchi. The story unfolds at Homurahara Academy, where three young women — Kaede Makidera, Kane Himuro, and Yukika Saegusa — navigate their daily lives. This adaptation deviates from the overarching narrative of restoring the Human Order, focusing instead on the lighthearted antics of these three protagonists.\n\nIn a delightful twist, the anime Fate/Grand Order: Himuro no Tenchi - 7-nin no Saikyou Gijin-hen draws inspiration from the 4-koma spin-off manga, Himuro no Tenchi Fate/school Life. The series showcases the humorous exploits of Kaede Makidera, Kane Himuro, and Yukiko Saegusa, bringing the characters to life in a new and entertaining way.\n\nIn a world where the boundaries between manga universes blur, this anime presents a unique crossover between Himuro no Tenchi: Fate/School Life and Fate/Grand Order. In an attempt to summon powerful servants, Ritsuka and Mash use Sacred Quartz, the coveted currency from the Fate/Grand Order mobile game. However, their efforts yield unexpected results, as proto-servants — beings with unconventional abilities — emerge, having taken over characters from the Himuro no Tenchi franchise.",
