  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Izumi and Mitsuki Sawatari are teenage sisters who have run away from home and find themselves in need of work. They come across a job posting to be maids for Yoshitaka Nakabayashi, a young millionaire who lives alone after the loss of his parents. Desperate, the sisters accept the position, hoping for room and board. However, they soon realize Yoshitaka has an authoritarian streak and some inappropriate fetishes. He demands the girls address him as \"Master\" and wear revealing costumes rather than normal maid uniforms. It becomes clear Yoshitaka intends to use his position of power to gratify his own twisted desires. The sisters attempt to resist and set boundaries, but Yoshitaka persists. Their only ally seems to be their pet alligator Pochi, who is very protective of Izumi. The girls must find a way to stand up to their employer's inappropriate behavior, or they risk becoming victims of his scheming perversions. This anime promises uncomfortable power dynamics and ecchi elements as the vulnerable Sawatari sisters try to escape an increasingly untenable job working for a millionaire mastermind with questionable motives.",
