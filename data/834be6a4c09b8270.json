    "text": "Now entering his first year at Amori High, a school notorious for its delinquents, Tousuke Rokudou dreams of a peaceful life with his friends. Instead, he finds himself the constant target of bullies. Desperate for a solution, Rokudou turns to a mysterious scroll passed down through generations in his family. Legend has it that this scroll holds the power to ward off demons and evil spirits. Eager to put an end to his torment, Rokudou uses the scroll, only to find that it leaves a strange mark on his forehead.\n\nRather than granting him the power to defend himself, the mark seems to attract the attention of the school's delinquent girls, with the notorious Ranna Himawari leading the pack. Despite his newfound popularity among these tough-as-nails girls, Rokudou's life remains far from peaceful. Caught between the relentless bullying of his classmates and the unexpected affection of his female admirers, Rokudou must navigate the chaos of high school in this action-packed and romantic comedy.",
