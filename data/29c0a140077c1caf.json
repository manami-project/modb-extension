    "text": "One spring day, amidst the last blooming cherry blossoms, an introverted bookworm stumbles upon a handwritten book titled \"Living with Dying\" in a hospital waiting room. The book turns out to be a diary belonging to his lively and popular classmate, Sakura Yamauchi, who confides in him that she is secretly battling a pancreatic illness with limited time left. Despite their contrasting personalities, the aloof bookworm becomes Sakura's confidant, and together, they navigate through life's ups and downs. Sakura's free-spirited nature and unpredictable actions slowly chip away at the bookworm's detached demeanor, leading him to experience life in a new light. As they spend more time together, the two form a unique bond that transcends the boundaries of friendship and love. Determined to live life to the fullest, Sakura shows the bookworm the true meaning of living, leaving a lasting impact on his heart.",
