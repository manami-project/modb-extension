  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuki Kagami has dreamed of attending the prestigious Houri Academy. When he finally earns a full scholarship, things quickly go awry. Due to a mistake by teacher Ayana Kakinozaka, Yuuki is assigned to the girls' dormitory, where boys are prohibited. Faced with potential expulsion, Yuuki reluctantly agrees to disguise himself as a girl while living in the dorm. Ayana, feeling responsible, supports Yuuki's secret by becoming his roommate. As the clumsy teacher lets her guard down around him, awkward situations arise. Yuuki must now convincingly pass as a girl at the academy while hiding his true gender from all but Ayana. It's a premarious deception, but a necessary one if Yuuki hopes to remain at Houri and achieve his academic dreams.",
