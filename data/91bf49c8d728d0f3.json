    "text": "Chika's reputation precedes him as a delinquent, but his desire to understand the depth of the traditional Japanese string instrument, the koto, leads him to the Tokise High School Koto Club. The club, once thriving, now teeters on the brink of extinction, with Takezou Kurata as its sole remaining member. Desperate to keep his passion for the koto alive, Takezou must recruit new members or face the club's termination.\n\nWhen Chika storms into the clubroom demanding to join, Takezou is initially hesitant. However, Chika's unexpected enthusiasm and seriousness convince Takezou to give him a chance. Joined by a motley crew of fellow students, including the gifted Satowa Houzuki and three of Chika's lively friends, the club now faces the challenge of blending their diverse skills and backgrounds into a harmonious ensemble.\n\nAs they strive to perfect their performance for the upcoming national competition, the members of the Koto Club will discover the true power of music and the bonds that form when they play together. Will their collective efforts be enough to save the club and secure their place in the prestigious competition? Only time will tell in \"Kono Oto Tomare! Sounds of Life.\"",
