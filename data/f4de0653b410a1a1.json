  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From the creative mind of Aoike Ryousuke comes the award-winning Catman series, a unique flash animation that offers a fresh take on storytelling. Set in a bustling metropolis inhabited by anthropomorphic cat-people, the series follows the adventures of the main character, Catman, as he navigates the complexities of urban life.\n\nCatman is a solitary figure who thrives on his independence and freedom. He spends his days wandering the city streets, finding inspiration in unexpected places, such as his favorite kung-fu movie. However, his apathetic and foul-mouthed demeanor often leads him into trouble, whether it's a heated feud with a local apple vendor or a missed opportunity for romance.\n\nThe series is notable for its lack of dialogue, relying instead on a lively soundtrack and subtitles in both Japanese and English to convey the story. Despite this, the show is engaging and entertaining, with each episode offering a unique glimpse into Catman's world. The series spans three seasons, with only the third one having been aired.\n\nWith its distinctive animation style, unique storytelling approach, and compelling protagonist, the Catman series is a must-watch for fans of animation and storytelling alike.",
