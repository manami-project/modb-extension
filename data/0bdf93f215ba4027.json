    "text": "Fuji International Speedway becomes the turning point for Kouya Madoka, a freelance photographer stuck in a rut, when he encounters high school Formula 4 racer Haruka Asahina. The once-passionate photographer, who lost his spark after a controversial photo led to personal and professional setbacks, finds his heart pounding again as he witnesses Haruka's fierce determination on the racetrack. Inspired by the young driver's ambition, Madoka decides to support Haruka and the underdog Komaki Motors youth team, reigniting his own passion for photography in the process. As the competition heats up and the stakes get higher, Madoka's newfound purpose to help Haruka achieve his dreams might just be the push both of them need to reach the top.",
