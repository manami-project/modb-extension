  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, but felt it would be too tiresome to design all the animals to populate the planet. So God appointed Heaven's Design Team, an organization of angel designers and engineers, to bring animals to life according to his specifications. New recruit Shimoda acts as the mediator between God and the design team. God makes absurd, unreasonable requests, presenting the team with constant challenges. Why can't unicorns exist? What makes an animal tasty? What's the mightiest ocean creature? Who would win in a bird versus snake face-off? The designers answer these questions and more as they brainstorm and develop innovative animal ideas to meet God's demands. Through trials and successes, they create clever solutions, conceiving giraffes, snakes, birds, anteaters and other species. The results are educational and entertaining, revealing fascinating insights into how each animal looks, lives and fits into the planet's ecology. Join the Heaven's Design Team on their quest to breathe life into God's wildest visions!",
