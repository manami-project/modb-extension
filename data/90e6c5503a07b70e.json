  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takao Kasuga is a high school student with a deep love for poetry and literature, particularly the works of Charles Baudelaire. He secretly admires his classmate Nanako Saeki, regarding her as his muse and unattainable object of affection. However, when Takao impulsively steals Nanako's gym clothes one day, his world turns upside down. His transgression is witnessed by Sawa Nakamura, a lonely and peculiar girl who sits behind Takao in class. Rather than exposing him, Sawa blackmails Takao into entering a \"contract\" with her, threatening to reveal his secret if he refuses. As Takao becomes unwillingly drawn into Sawa's disturbing obsessions, he realizes the dangerous thorns underlying her seemingly harmless fantasies. Trapped by Sawa's manipulations, Takao struggles between his sense of morality and his fear of the consequences. His spiral into Sawa's world threatens his hopes of getting closer to Nanako as well as his own sanity. With darkness and desire intertwining, Takao must find a way to break free before he is irreparably corrupted.",
