  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime short film follows a strange encounter that takes place one night in a child's bedroom. A mysterious \"sand man\" suddenly appears and extends an invitation to the child's dusty, forgotten stuffed animal to venture out over the nearby hill. Unwilling to be separated from his beloved toy, the child bravely follows after them into the darkness. This imaginative story promises an adventure into the realm of dreams and the subconscious. Created as a graduate project in 2012 by animator Hiroko Satsuma while studying at the prestigious Tokyo University of the Arts, this animated film uses fantasy and metaphor to explore timeless themes of childhood, innocence and the world of imagination that lives within us all.",
