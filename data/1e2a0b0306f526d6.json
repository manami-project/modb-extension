    "text": "In a world divided between humans and monster-like beings called katawara, an unlikely group forms to promote peace and justice. Tama, a kindhearted katawara, loves humans and protects them from harm, even if it means battling others of her own kind. Her stepbrother Jinka, though mostly human himself, harbors animosity toward humans. Completing their trio is Shinsuke, a cowardly yet determined swordsman hoping to overcome his weaknesses. As they travel the land, they uncover a sinister plot to transform humans into katawara through horrific experiments. Joining forces with Shakuyaku, a survivor of these experiments, Tama, Jinka, and Shinsuke vow to defeat whoever is behind this scheme. They soon find themselves embroiled in an epic confrontation that will push them to their very limits. Along their legendary journey, they will meet unforgettable people, visit remarkable places, and battle fearsome creatures. But their bond of loyalty and commitment to doing what's right will be put to the ultimate test.",
