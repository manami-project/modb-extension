However, Henri Lucas has a new project in store for Ichigo, bringing her together with Makoto Kashino and new team members Lemon Yamagishi and Johnny McBeal. As they work together to establish their own sweets shop, Ichigo and Makoto's bond deepens, but complications arise as Johnny and Miya Koshiro vie for their affections.
