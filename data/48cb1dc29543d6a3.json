    "text": "Holy Magistrate Keter, the divine leader under the Almighty's command, entrusts the Angelic Guard with the mission of gathering scattered orbs across the world. Among the guard's ranks is Lucifer, a formidable leader with a rebellious spirit and power said to rival the Almighty. Accompanied by Uriel, another esteemed guard leader, they embark on their quest. However, when Keter reveals Lucifer's rumored insurrection to Uriel, disbelief turns into suspicion as Uriel uncovers a connection between the allegations and a cataclysmic event that once threatened heaven's very existence.\n\nMeanwhile, Oragon, a solitary dragon, is summoned to protect the Strike World from impending doom. As he embarks on his journey, he encounters legendary figures, including the fallen angel Lucifer, the chivalrous Knight of Knights Arthur, and the enchanting mage princess Solomon. These tales, inspired by the Monster Strike mobile game, unfold in an omnibus format, unrelated to previous Monster Strike the Animation seasons. With Episode 0 included, this anime presents a captivating narrative that intertwines the fates of mythical creatures and celestial beings.",
