  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now, in a realm where five formidable races once clashed for dominance, humanity emerged triumphant under the leadership of the legendary hero, Sid. However, this world abruptly 'rewrites' itself before the very eyes of a young man named Kai. In this new reality, humanity has been crushed in the absence of their hero, Sid, leaving dragons and demons to reign supreme. Kai, once a celebrated existence, now finds himself forgotten by all humans. Yet, a chance encounter with an enigmatic girl, Rinne, ignites his resolve to defy this altered destiny. In a world bereft of heroes, Kai assumes the mantle, inheriting Sid's sword and martial prowess, daring to challenge the powerful races that now control the land. As the guardian of the crypts that once held these races captive, Kai's journey to restore humanity's glory begins in this unfamiliar, rewritten world where only he remembers the truth.",
