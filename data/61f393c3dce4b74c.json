    "text": "To the untrained eye, St. Morwald's Home for Children may seem like an ordinary orphanage, but for the cunning and adventurous Earwig, it's a haven where she effortlessly bends everyone to her will. However, her perfect world is turned upside down when she is adopted by the enigmatic Bella Yaga and the Mandrake, a magically gifted couple. Earwig finds herself in a peculiar house filled with hidden rooms, spell books, and potions, where she must navigate the whims of her new guardians, one of whom is a selfish witch. Undeterred by her new surroundings, Earwig, with the help of a talking cat, embarks on a journey to uncover the secrets of her new home and the mysterious song that could lead her to the family she never knew she had. Little does she know, her mother was a powerful witch, and Earwig's magical adventure is only just beginning. This captivating tale is based on the novel \"Earwig and the Witch\" by Diana Wynne Jones.",
