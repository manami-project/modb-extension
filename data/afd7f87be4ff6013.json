    "text": "Hikari Kokura is a passionate first-year high school student who has loved rifle shooting since elementary school. She enrolls at Chidori High School due to their shooting club, only to discover that the club was recently disbanded from lack of interest. Undeterred, Hikari takes it upon herself to revive the club. She manages to recruit her studious childhood friend Izumi Shibusawa along with two other skilled freshmen markswomen that Hikari knows from past competitions - the half-Russian Erika Meinohama and the stoic former middle school tournament winner Yukio Igarashi. Together, these four young women form the new Chidori High Shooting Club. Though coming from diverse backgrounds, they share a common love for rifle shooting. They train tirelessly with aspirations of competing on the national level.",
