  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gyagu Manga Biyori is a comedy anime comprised of short, humorous stories depicting the bizarre and ridiculous adventures of an eclectic cast of characters. Though each 5-minute story has its own mini-plot, the overarching theme is the absurdity and whimsy of daily life situations taken to the extreme. We follow an offbeat group as they go about their days, encountering such silly scenarios as motorcycle races with a ramen fairy, solving cases like bumbling detectives, and even battling over emo trading cards. Other madcap tales feature an eccentric Dutch inventor, supernatural body swapping with an alien octopus emperor, and characters stuck in loops of reincarnation. With its rapid-fire pacing and completely unpredictable storylines ranging from sea voyages to Ramen mascots coming to life, Gyagu Manga Biyori thrives on being deliberately pointless, feeding off the stupidity of mundane moments blown out of proportion for maximum comedic effect. Though the series is plotless at its core, the outlandish creativity and sheer lunacy of each vignette will leave viewers in stitches.",
