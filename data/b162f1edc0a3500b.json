  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Excellence Award winner at the 2013 Japan Media Arts Festival, a theatrically-released short film from ROBOT, the creators of the Academy Award-winning La Maison en Petits Cubes, presents a heartwarming tale set in Japan during the economic boom of the 1980s. A vintage, furniture-style television set, manufactured in the 1960s and faithfully serving its owners for years, finds itself unceremoniously discarded in a junkyard. Refusing to accept its fate, the resilient TV embarks on a daring escape from its unfamiliar and desolate surroundings.",
