  "synopsis": {
    "text": "An elderly man attempts to build an android replica of a girl from his memories, carefully crafting her machinery body piece by piece. Though he envisions her as a pure creation, she rejects this imposed identity that does not align with her emerging sense of self. Ultimately she dismantles herself in an act of defiance, declaring \"This is not me!\" This poignant anime short explores notions of identity, autonomy, and the ethics of artificial creation. Through rich visual symbolism, it highlights both the appeal and the hubris inherent in trying to replicate human consciousness. Though brief, its themes resonate deeply. Crafted as a student work while director Saya Fukase studied animation, this film promises more thoughtful insights from a rising creative voice.",
