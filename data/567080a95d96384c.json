  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This four-episode OVA tells the story of Hamtaro, an adventurous hamster, and his owner Natsumi. In the first episode, Natsumi comes home to find that Hamtaro has escaped from his cage and is hiding under a blanket. She struggles to catch the energetic and tricky hamster. The second episode focuses on Hamtaro and his hamster friends' attempts to help Bijou retrieve a cookie that fell into a vase. After several failed plans, Hamtaro comes up with an ingenious idea that succeeds. In the third episode, Natsumi tells Hamtaro she loves him before leaving for school. Hamtaro misinterprets this as romantic love. He then sees Natsumi walking to school with a male classmate and becomes jealous, seeing the boy as his rival. The fourth episode shows Hamtaro and his friends having silly adventures, like Hamtaro landing on a bird and the others running from a sleeping cat. Originally released directly to VHS in 1999, this OVA flew under the radar for years before gaining attention in 2017. It brings humor and fun to the delightful world of Hamtaro and his hamster pals.",
