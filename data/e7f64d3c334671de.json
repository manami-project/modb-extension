  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime in question revolves around the song \"RE:I AM\" by Japanese singer Aimer. This song served as the ending theme to the 6th episode of the anime series Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn. It was also later reused as the opening theme to the 18th episode of the related series Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn RE:0096. Initially, \"RE:I AM\" was released as the title track on Aimer's 5th single in 2010. The limited first edition of the CD included a DVD with a music video for the song directed by Tsuyoshi Araki. Over the years, \"RE:I AM\" has become closely associated with the Gundam franchise through its usage in the aforementioned anime series. With its linkage to the epic mecha anime and Aimer's haunting vocals, \"RE:I AM\" is a song that sticks in the minds of many anime fans even over a decade after its release. Those moved by the emotional weight of Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn will likely fondly recall the mournful lyrics and melody behind this evocative ending theme.",
