  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ray, a prodigious surgeon with a mysterious past, was once a child in an enigmatic orphanage where children were treated as commodities, subjected to experimental surgeries, and raised to be organ donors. Ray's own eyes were taken from her, but a benevolent stranger gifted her with extraordinary artificial eyes that granted her x-ray vision.\n\nNow, as a skilled doctor, Ray performs complex medical procedures that leave others in awe, tackling cases that others deem impossible. Her surgical prowess is not just a profession, but a mission to uncover the truth about her past and the other children she was raised with. As she embarks on a new chapter in a private clinic, Ray's past begins to resurface, propelling her on a quest to find the farm where she was raised and seek justice for the children who shared her fate.",
