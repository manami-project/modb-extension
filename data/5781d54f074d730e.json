  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Karuko, a young woman, is expected to meet a prospective spouse as per her father's wishes. However, her heart yearns for someone else - a mysterious boy she encountered in Chichibu during her childhood. With vivid memories of strolling through Chichibu Shrine, admiring the pink flower blankets at Hitsujiyama Park, and marveling at the mountain stream in Nagatoro and the sea of clouds from Mitsumine Shrine, Karuko decides to embark on a journey to Chichibu. Clinging to the hope of reuniting with her unnamed childhood companion, she sets out to relive those cherished moments and perhaps, find the boy who has never left her thoughts. This heartwarming tale, commissioned by the Seibu Tetsudou K.K. railway company, beautifully showcases not only the emotional journey of its protagonist but also the picturesque railway lines of Chichibu.",
