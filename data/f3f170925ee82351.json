  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After getting into an argument with his father, 14-year-old Ikuto Touhohin impulsively runs away from home. He boards a cruise ship to escape, but gets caught in a massive storm and is thrown overboard. Ikuto regains consciousness on a remote island called Airantou, surrounded by whirlpools that make it nearly impossible to leave. To Ikuto's surprise, Airantou is inhabited solely by women. Having never met a man before, the island girls are fascinated by Ikuto and compete for his affection. The woman who rescued Ikuto from the sea, Suzu, is particularly smitten. Overwhelmed by the aggressive attention, Ikuto tries various unsuccessful schemes to escape Airantou and return home. In the process, Ikuto discovers Airantou possesses unique wildlife and natural wonders unseen anywhere else. Though initially viewing the island as a prison, Ikuto starts adapting to its rhythms and getting to know its inhabitants. Still desperate to avoid being tied down in marriage at his young age, Ikuto faces many adventures and hijinks as the women continually vie for his heart.",
