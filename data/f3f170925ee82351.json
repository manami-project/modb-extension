    "text": "After a heated altercation with his father, young Ikuto Touhohin impulsively decides to leave home. His escape plan takes an unexpected turn when a violent storm hits the ship he's on, sweeping him overboard. When Ikuto awakens, he finds himself on an unfamiliar island, isolated from the rest of the world. The island, known as Airantou, is inhabited solely by beautiful women, each of whom sees Ikuto as a potential husband. The island's treacherous whirlpools make escape nearly impossible, leaving Ikuto to navigate a world where he is the center of attention. As the only man on the island, Ikuto must adapt to this peculiar paradise filled with unusual flora, fauna, and a bevy of eager women, all while trying to find a way back home.",
