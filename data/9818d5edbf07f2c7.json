  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It has been 8 years since western ships first arrived in 19th century Japan, bringing with them mechanized dolls and steam-powered devices that spread rapidly. A violent group called the Wind Gang embraces these new technologies, using clockwork weapons and steam-powered machines to attack peaceful villages. When the Wind Gang assaults and destroys the village of a young clockwork artisan named Hiwou, he escapes with his friends aboard a giant clockwork doll called Homura. Seeking to restore peace, Hiwou resolves to find his missing father and defeat the Wind Gang. Joining him on this quest is the massive Homura doll and Hiwou's close childhood friends. Traveling across Japan, the group encounters the Wind Gang's campaign to forcibly bring about an industrial revolution. To reclaim their homes and way of life, Hiwou and friends must master the technology introduced by westerners while holding fast to their traditions. Theirs is a journey of steam and spirit.",
