  "synopsis": {
    "text": "That's the tale of a world thrown into chaos as the malevolent Demon King Giri, once imprisoned by the legendary Migu Migu tribe, breaks free from his centuries-old seal. Enter Nike, an unwilling hero-in-training, who dreams of becoming a wizard but is destined for a different path. Joined by Kukuri, a young and clumsy mage who hails from the very tribe that once vanquished Giri, the duo embarks on an epic quest to restore peace to their world.\n\nNike, whose name playfully echoes a certain sports brand, finds himself in a family where heroism is the ultimate career goal. His father, a former heroism enthusiast, and his mother, armed with charts and village surveys, are determined to guide Nike towards the path of the hero. Despite his initial reluctance, Nike embraces his destiny, teaming up with Kukuri to face the looming threat of Demon King Giri.\n\nAs they journey across the land, they gather an eccentric crew of companions, including a near-naked elderly man and a loincloth-clad wind spirit. Together, they assist the people they encounter, collect powerful Guru Guru spells, and share countless laughs along the way. This RPG-style adventure promises a blend of thrilling action, heartwarming camaraderie, and hilarious escapades that will leave you eager for more.",
