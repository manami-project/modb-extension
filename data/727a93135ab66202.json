    "text": "School boy Kuchao is an outcast in his class, clinging to his balloon while others let theirs soar. His one constant companion is a piece of bubble gum, which transports him to a world of imagination after school hours. In this realm, his balloon takes on a life of its own, transforming into various objects as he chews his gum. His creative mind flourishes, and just as he thinks he's alone in this fantastical world, a bird approaches. This enchanting anime, a 2010 production from Tokyo University of the Arts, invites viewers to join Kuchao on his imaginative journey.",
