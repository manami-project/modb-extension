  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Natra, a small and seemingly insignificant kingdom, finds itself in a peculiar predicament when its prince, Wein Salema Arbalest, decides to auction off his homeland to the highest bidder. The prince, known for his exceptional intellect and wisdom, is next in line to rule after his ailing father. However, the responsibilities of governing are far from what Wein desires; instead, he yearns for a tranquil life away from royal duties.\n\nWith the power of the throne at his disposal, Wein embarks on a cunning plan to raise the value of Natra, intending to use the profits to fund his peaceful retirement. Yet, his ingenious schemes lead to unforeseen outcomes. As the kingdom begins to prosper under his unwitting guidance, Wein's popularity among his subjects soars, and Natra starts to secure unexpected victories over its more formidable neighbors.\n\nIronically, Wein's dreams of a serene life are continually thwarted by his own brilliance. As his achievements grow, so does the admiration of his people, making it increasingly difficult for him to abandon his role as their leader. Despite his initial intentions, Prince Wein finds himself becoming the hero his kingdom needs, even if it's not the peaceful existence he craved.",
