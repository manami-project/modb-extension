  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shun, Seiya, Shiryu, and their leader, Athena (Saori), embark on a perilous journey to the mythical realm of Asgard, nestled in the frigid expanses of Northern Europe. The catalyst for their expedition is a cryptic warning delivered by a mysterious Siberian man rescued by Hyoga, the Cygnus Saint. Hyoga, sent ahead to investigate the impending doom, vanishes without a trace.\n\nAs the Bronze Saints and Athena traverse the enigmatic landscape of Asgard, they seek an audience with Dolbar, the reigning authority and reincarnation of the legendary Odin. Dolbar feigns ignorance regarding Hyoga's disappearance and offers the group shelter for the night. However, his ulterior motives become evident as he captures Athena with the intent of seizing control over the sanctuary.\n\nThe Bronze Saints, driven by loyalty and unwavering determination, rise against Dolbar's formidable God Warriors in a desperate bid to rescue their beloved patron goddess. As the battle lines are drawn, the saints find themselves entangled in a treacherous web of deceit and danger, surpassing anything they had ever anticipated.",
