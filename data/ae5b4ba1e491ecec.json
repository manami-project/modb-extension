    "text": "This lively tale follows the spirited Michi Sonoda, who, after a humiliating defeat in her final middle school judo tournament, decides to call it quits on the sport. With her sights set on more adolescent pursuits like finding a boyfriend, Michi is dismayed to discover that her victorious opponent, Towa Hiura, has enrolled in the same high school. As Michi attempts to leave her judo days behind, she finds herself drawn back into the world of tatami mats when Towa tries to establish a judo club at their school. With the encouragement of her former teammate, Sanae, and the unexpected reappearance of her past rival, Michi may just find that her passion for judo is not as easily extinguished as she thought. As she navigates the challenges of high school life and the possibility of rekindling her love for the sport, Michi must decide if there's still room in her heart for judo.",
