    "text": "Ronin Akitsu Masanosuke, a gifted swordsman with a timid demeanor, finds himself perpetually unemployed during Japan's peaceful Edo period. His meek personality and lack of confidence often lead to his dismissal, leaving him questioning his worth as a samurai. At his wit's end, Masanosuke accepts a job offer from Yaichi, a charismatic and enigmatic figure draped in pink, to work as his bodyguard.\n\nUnbeknownst to Masanosuke, Yaichi is the leader of the notorious gang, the Five Leaves. As he delves deeper into their illicit activities, Masanosuke grapples with his own principles. Yet, his curiosity and growing fascination with the outlaws propel him forward, leading him to uncover the past and motivations of this mysterious band of criminals. As he forms bonds with his eccentric companions, Masanosuke finds himself growing as a person, even as his dreams of honor begin to fade. Will he find his place among the Five Leaves, or will his loyalties be tested?",
