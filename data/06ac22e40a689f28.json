  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ichiro Hanada is a mischievous young boy living in a rural Japanese town with his family, including his parents, grandfather, and older sister. Known for his rude behavior and constant pranks, Ichiro frequently gets on the nerves of his family and neighbors. One day, while fleeing after pulling a nasty prank, Ichiro gets hit by a truck and is severely injured. After miraculously surviving, he awakens to find that he has gained the ability to see and communicate with ghosts. These ghosts turn out to be spirits of recently deceased people unable to pass on due to some unresolved issue from their lives. As the only one able to see them, Ichiro becomes responsible for helping these ghosts fulfill their last wishes so they can find peace. Though initially a nuisance to him, Ichiro's ghostly adventures prove to impart important life lessons that gradually transform the young boy's defiant attitude. With the help of his friends Souta and Kei-chan, as well as his loyal dog Jiro, Ichiro sets out to assist the lingering spirits while continuing to navigate his own chaotic life.",
