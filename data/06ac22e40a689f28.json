  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One fateful day, young Ichiro Hanada's mischievous antics lead him to be struck by a truck, leaving him with an unexpected ability: the power to see and communicate with ghosts. Living in a tranquil rural town with his family, Ichiro is far from the model child, often teasing his sister, disrespecting his mother, and causing trouble for those around him. However, his newfound gift presents him with a unique challenge, as spirits who have unfinished business in the mortal world seek him out for assistance.\n\nAs Ichiro reluctantly aids these ghosts in resolving their lingering issues, he embarks on a series of adventures that help him mature and learn valuable life lessons. Joined by his friends Souta, Kei-chan, and his loyal dog Jiro, Ichiro navigates the delicate balance between the world of the living and the dead. Will this unruly boy find the compassion and understanding needed to help these spirits find peace, or will this new ability prove to be just another nuisance in his already chaotic life?",
