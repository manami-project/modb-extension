    "text": "Rudo is a poor boy living in the slums of a floating town where the wealthy live lavishly while casting their garbage into the abyss below. When Rudo is falsely accused of murder, he is thrown into this abyss as punishment. In this pit, the discarded trash has spawned monstrous creatures. Rudo is rescued by a man named Enjin who reveals himself as a \"janitor\"â€”someone who fights these trash monsters using special weapons. To get revenge on those who unfairly exiled him while also investigating his guardian's murder, Rudo becomes a janitor. He must battle the beasts of the abyss and find a way back to the floating city above.",
