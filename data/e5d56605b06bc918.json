  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tomoko, a young girl, visits the Hiroshima Peace Memorial alone. There she has an encounter with the spirit of Sadako, a girl who was just two years old when the atomic bomb devastated Hiroshima in 1945. Though Sadako initially survived the blast, she died a decade later from radiation sickness. Sadako shares her personal experience of living through the horrific aftermath with Tomoko. Through this mystical meeting, Tomoko gains insight into the suffering endured by Sadako and many children like her due to the bomb. Though difficult, it is a journey that opens Tomoko's eyes to the true human cost of nuclear weapons. Ultimately, the tale underscores the importance of remembering history so that such immense tragedy is never repeated. It highlights the resilient endurance of the human spirit epitomized by Sadako. The story aims to promote peace and nuclear disarmament by connecting the viewer sympathetically with an atomic bomb victim's perspective.",
