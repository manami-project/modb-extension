  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now entering the scene is Akutabe, an unconventional detective who employs the help of otherworldly demons to solve his cases. Alongside his assistant, Rinko Sakuma, they navigate through supernatural challenges and unpredictable situations. One day, Rinko's life takes a drastic turn when she discovers the true nature of her employer's business.\n\nAkutabe's methods involve summoning demons, like the mischievous and lustful Azazel, to carry out tasks for his clients. In exchange for their services, these demons demand peculiar offerings, such as food or other forms of appeasement. Rinko finds herself in a bind when she accidentally signs a contract with Azazel, sealing her fate with him for eternity.\n\nAs Rinko adjusts to her new reality, she must work alongside Azazel, the food-loving demon Beelzebub, and a host of equally eccentric creatures to complete assignments for the detective agency. However, with these demons' penchant for creating chaos and worsening situations, Rinko and Akutabe have their work cut out for them. Join this dynamic duo and their motley crew of supernatural beings as they tackle cases that are far from ordinary.",
