  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Libertia, once a desolate wasteland dubbed 'the planet of death', has been transformed into a utopia by humanity's ingenious creation of three colossal mirrors. In this idyllic setting, Professor Grace and his granddaughter, Alcia, enjoy a serene existence, until their tranquility is shattered by an unexpected assault. The ruthless Guild soldiers, in pursuit of the professor and a unique armor known as Legaciam, lay siege to their home. Legaciam, capable of withstanding extreme heat and enabling exploration of otherwise uninhabitable zones, is a prize the Guild is determined to seize.\n\nAlcia, who was assisting her grandfather with Legaciam's testing, narrowly escapes the onslaught while piloting the armor. However, the Guild's relentless pursuit of Legaciam continues, leaving Alcia and her friends in a desperate struggle to safeguard this invaluable relic. As the stakes rise, the question lingers - what makes Legaciam so crucial, and can Alcia and her allies evade the Guild's clutches and protect their prized possession? This thrilling anime, a spin-off of Akinori Endo's novel 'Warrior of the Tower: Relic Armor Legacium', promises a gripping tale of courage, friendship, and survival.",
