  "synopsis": {
    "text": "East and West lie in ruins following the devastation of World War III in 2085, where once-thriving cities now stand as desolate wastelands. The remnants of humanity are relentlessly pursued by the MME, an army of mechanical soldiers initially created to fight the war. With deep-seated animosities preventing a united front, a last-ditch effort emerges: the evacuation of survivors to Mars Base, where they can regroup and strategize to reclaim their home world.\n\nAmong the survivors is a young woman named Sandy Neuman, who grapples with the burden of her father's role in the catastrophic downfall of civilization. Unbeknownst to her, she harbors the potential for humanity's salvation. As fate weaves together newfound friendships and alliances, a new Gall Force emerges, poised to challenge the impending destruction and restore hope to a beleaguered world.",
