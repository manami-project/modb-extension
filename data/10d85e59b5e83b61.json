In this thrilling anime, every event is governed by programs, overseen by enigmatic creatures called Promin. However, when Promin malfunction and transform into Bugmin, they wreak havoc and cause real-life bugs. Initially, these Bugmin are merely minor nuisances, but their disruptions soon escalate into a global threat. Enter Yuuto, a determined boy who teams up with Wanda, a space dog, to capture Bugmin using a camera-like device and special key items. Promin possess an extraordinary ability known as Kamiwaza, which enables them to perform miraculous feats like accelerating objects, generating fire, or creating objects. As Yuuto and Wanda harness the power of Kamiwaza to combat the Bugmin, the fate of the world rests in their hands. Will they succeed in restoring order and preventing a catastrophic Bugmin uprising? Join Yuuto and Wanda on their epic adventure to find out!",
