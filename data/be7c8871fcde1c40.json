  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yukihisa Matsuda is the arrogant principal conductor of the Rising Star Orchestra who travels to Paris to perform Wagner's Tannh√§user Overture as a guest conductor. When he overhears praise for his young conducting rival Shinichi Chiaki, who conducts the Roux-Marlet Orchestra, Matsuda becomes jealous and contemptuous of Chiaki's success. After being dumped by his mistress following his own performance, a brooding Matsuda runs into Chiaki and convinces him to go out for drinks, pretending he wants to offer career advice. However, Matsuda soon turns the conversation to Chiaki's love life, looking to embarrass his rival. Over the course of the evening, Matsuda endures further humiliations, including an awkward encounter with Chiaki's girlfriend Nodame. His experience leaves the conceited conductor recognizing he may have finally met his match.",
