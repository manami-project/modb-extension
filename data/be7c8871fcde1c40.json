    "text": "Chiaki's rising fame as a conductor in Paris becomes a thorn in the side of Yukihisa Matsuda, the principal conductor of the Rising Star Orchestra. Matsuda, who is in Paris to conduct Wagner's Tannh√§user Overture with the Recyl Symphony Orchestra, finds himself overshadowed by Chiaki's success with the Roux-Marlet Orchestra. After a humiliating breakup with his mistress, Matsuda seeks out Chiaki under the guise of offering career advice. However, the conversation quickly turns personal, much to Chiaki's annoyance. As the night unfolds, Matsuda's envy and insecurities lead to a series of unfortunate events, leaving him to question whether his evening could possibly get any worse. This OVA explores the tumultuous relationship between the two conductors, set against the backdrop of the competitive world of classical music in Paris.",
