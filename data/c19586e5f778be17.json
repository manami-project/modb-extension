    "text": "Doma Umaru, a 16-year-old high school student, is the epitome of perfection in the eyes of her peers and teachers. She is admired for her beauty, intelligence, and athletic prowess. However, her older brother Taihei knows the truth behind this fa√ßade. Once Umaru steps through their front door, she sheds her perfect persona and transforms into a lazy, junk food-loving otaku, leaving all household chores to Taihei.\n\nUmaru's days at home are filled with gaming, watching TV, and consuming cola and snacks, while Taihei juggles a full-time job and managing the household. Despite the stark contrast between her public and private life, Umaru maintains strong bonds with her friends Nana Ebina, Kirie Motoba, and her self-proclaimed rival, Sylphinford Tachibana.\n\nAs Taihei strives to keep up with Umaru's demands and maintain their secret, they navigate through the daily adventures of sibling life. This heartwarming and comedic tale explores the unbreakable bonds between siblings and friends, and the sometimes surprising truths behind people's appearances.",
