  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Umaru Doma appears to be the perfect high school girl - beautiful, kind, intelligent and popular. However, at home, she has a secret alternate personality. As soon as she puts on her hamster hoodie after coming home, Umaru transforms into a lazy otaku who lounges around eating junk food, playing video games, and making her responsible older brother Taihei do all the cooking, cleaning and shopping. At school, Umaru befriends girls from her class - the stoic Kirie Motoba and competitive Sylphinford Tachibana. Unbeknownst to them, Kirie and Sylphinford are younger sisters of Taihei's colleagues. Back at home, Taihei struggles to manage his busy work life along with taking care of his slothful younger sister and her endless demands. However, he still cares deeply for Umaru. Ultimately, Himouto! Umaru-chan is a comedic story about the daily adventures of the siblings Umaru and Taihei. It explores the contrast between Umaru's public and private personas, as well as the unbreakable bond between brother and sister.",
