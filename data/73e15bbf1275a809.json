    "text": "Reina Vance has emerged victorious from the prestigious Queen's Blade tournament, earning her the throne of the realm. However, the end of the tournament does not mean the end of conflict for the participants. The beautiful and formidable fighters who once gathered to compete in the tournament are now scattered throughout the land, seeking out their own adventures and pursuing their own desires.\n\nFor some, the next challenge comes sooner than expected. Elina Vance, Reina's sister, finds herself in dire straits as her castle is attacked by hundreds of soldiers who refuse to recognize the new ruler. Defeated and publicly humiliated by the cunning Echidna, Elina is left bound and vulnerable. Will Reina arrive in time to save her sister from this perilous situation? The battles may be over, but the true challenges are just beginning for the warriors of Queen's Blade.",
