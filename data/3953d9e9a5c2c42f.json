  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuno has enrolled at Yamabuki High School to pursue an art degree. She moves into the Hidamari Apartments, where she joins her best friend Miyako and upperclassmen Hiro and Sae. The apartments are located right in front of the high school. This season continues to follow Yuno's daily life in her first year at Yamabuki. It overlaps timeline-wise with the previous season, showing events that happen concurrently as well as before and after. Each episode depicts the ordinary yet whimsical routines of Yuno and her friends. We see them attending classes with eccentric teachers, spending leisurely days off sketching at shrines, enjoying hot pot under the kotatsu on cold days, and finding amusement in mundane activities. Through this avant-garde slice-of-life collage, we gain an expanding insight into the relationships and personalities of the Hidamari residents. Their infectious energy and unique perspectives fill the surreal world they inhabit with joy and creativity.",
