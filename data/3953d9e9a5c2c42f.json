    "text": "Yamabuki High School's Hidamari Apartments is once again the setting for a delightful and unconventional tale of friendship and daily life. Yuno, our young protagonist, has successfully passed her entrance exam and is now pursuing an art degree. Alongside her best friend Miyako, and seniors Hiro and Sae, Yuno navigates the intricacies of high school life in a world that doesn't adhere to the conventional 'A follows B follows C' pattern. Instead, the story unfolds in a captivating collage of events that take place during, before, and after Yuno's first year at high school, offering a unique blend of avant-garde and slice-of-life narratives. From leisurely sketching at a shrine to cozy winter days spent under a kotatsu, the girls of Hidamari Apartments find joy and camaraderie in the most mundane activities, creating an engaging and heartwarming tale that promises to surprise and delight viewers.",
