  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She athed in a layer of apathy and narcissism, Hachiman Hikigaya navigates the tumultuous waters of high school with a skewed perspective on life and relationships. With no friends or dreams for the future, Hachiman's cynical outlook lands him in hot water when his teacher forces him to join the Volunteer Service Club. Led by the intelligent and beautiful Yukino Yukinoshita, the club's mission is to aid students in achieving their goals.\n\nAs Hachiman and Yukino work together to solve their classmates' problems, their contrasting personalities and beliefs collide. While Yukino believes it's her duty to help others, Hachiman sees society as a farce and questions the sincerity of people's happiness. Despite his reluctance, Hachiman finds himself entangled in the lives of those around him, forcing him to confront his own pessimistic views.\n\nIn this romantic comedy, will Hachiman's negative outlook on life prove to be an obstacle, or will it become an unexpected tool in helping others? As he grapples with his newfound role in the Volunteer Service Club, Hachiman's journey through high school is anything but ordinary.",
