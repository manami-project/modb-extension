    "text": "Chen Xing is the young master of the Chen family in Dongyang City. After losing both his parents at a young age, he was next in line to become the family leader. However, Chen Sheng, the ambitious interim head of the Chen clan, plotted against Chen Xing in order to usurp control. Believing he succeeded in eliminating Chen Xing, Chen Sheng's plans are thwarted when Chen Xing miraculously survives. Chen Xing chances upon the long-lost supreme skill, 'The Ancient Star God Art', and through practicing parts of it, grows exponentially stronger. He returns to expose Chen Sheng's treachery and imprisons him, putting his coup attempt on hold. Seeking further mastery of 'The Ancient Star God Art', Chen Xing begins collecting the star beasts required to cultivate the technique. During this time, he rescues Mu Qinglan, the daughter of the Xuanyang Palace's master, from a star beast attack. On her advice, Chen Xing persists through adversity to join the Xuanyang Palace. However, upon entering, he immediately clashes with Jian Feikong, the son of the Xuanyang Palace's vice master.",
