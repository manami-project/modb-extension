  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the vast expanse of space, diverse civilizations have come together to inhabit Planet Jet. To maintain peace, the Jetters were formed - an intergalactic police force that protects against the threat of the Hige Hige Dan, a gang of thieves seeking to steal unique objects across the universe. The Jetters are led by Mighty, a powerful and respected Bomberman. However, when Mighty mysteriously vanishes, his immature younger brother Shirobon is forced to step up and take his place. Although initially crude and irresponsible, Shirobon shows great potential. Together with his eccentric crew of comrades, he confronts the chaos-causing Hige Hige Dan with quirky action and determination. As Shirobon fights to live up to his brother's legacy, he grapples with grief over Mighty's disappearance. Through his adventures, Shirobon pursues clues regarding his brother's fate. In the process, he discovers what it truly means to be a hero - overcoming self-doubt and finding the courage to stand up when the universe needs him most. With new friends and skills in tow, Shirobon inches closer to uncovering the truth about his brother while protecting the Jetters' intergalactic community from harm.",
