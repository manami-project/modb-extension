  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Naomi Armitage, a cybernetic Martian officer with a lethal attitude and an equally deadly gun, finds herself in a desperate battle for survival against Rene d'Anclaude, a man hell-bent on eradicating all 'Third Type' androids living incognito among the Martian population in the year 2179. These human-like robots, created by a nationalist faction, have infiltrated society undetected until d'Anclaude's crusade threatens their existence.\n\nArmitage, a 'Third Type' herself, is partnered with Ross Sylibus, a human cop grappling with his own prejudices against robots after losing his partner to a cybernetic killer. When Ross is critically injured and receives robotic limb replacements, he must confront his own biases and redefine what it means to be human.\n\nAs they delve deeper into the mystery behind the creation of the 'Third Type,' Armitage and Ross form an unbreakable bond, united by love and hope. Their journey reveals a secret with the potential to annihilate two worlds, pushing them to question the true essence of humanity and the blurred lines between man and machine. In this thrilling tale of technology, emotion, and survival, Armitage and Ross fight to protect their world from the clutches of d'Anclaude's destructive ambitions.",
