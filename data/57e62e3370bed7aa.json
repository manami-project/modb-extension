Ueki is thrust into a high-stakes tournament where junior high school students, chosen by God Candidates and imbued with special powers, battle it out to determine the next ruler of the Celestial World.

As he delves deeper into the competition, Ueki's sense of justice is ignited, fueling his determination to win and prevent the Blank Talent from falling into malicious hands. However, the path to victory is fraught with challenges, as Ueki must face off against opponents with formidable and bizarre abilities.
