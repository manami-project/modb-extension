  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yukiteru is a lonely middle school student who spends his days writing in a diary on his phone and talking with his imaginary friends Deus Ex Machina, the god of space and time, and Murmur, Deus's servant. However, Yukiteru soon discovers that Deus is real when Deus gives him a \"Random Diary\" that predicts entries in Yukiteru's future. Yukiteru is then forced to participate in a survival game against 11 other people who also have special future diaries with unique abilities. The contestants must use their diaries to try to kill each other within 90 days, and the last one standing will become the new God of Space and Time. \n\nYukiteru reluctantly teams up with his obsessive stalker Yuno Gasai, who possesses a future diary herself. With her help, Yukiteru attempts to find and eliminate the other diary users in order to survive. However, there seems to be more to Yuno than meets the eye, and she may have ulterior motives for keeping Yukiteru alive. As the deadly game unfolds, Yukiteru must use his wits and future diary in unexpected ways to outsmart the competition while also determining if he can really trust his unsettling ally Yuno.",
