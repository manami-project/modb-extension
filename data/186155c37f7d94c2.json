    "text": "Ranma Saotome is a talented teenage martial artist who, while training in China with his father Genma, falls into a cursed spring at Jusenkyo. As a result, Ranma is now cursed to transform into a girl when splashed with cold water. Hot water can change him back into a boy, but the curse remains. To complicate matters further, Genma had arranged for Ranma to marry one of Soun Tendo's daughters, in order to carry on the family martial arts traditions. Soun decides that Ranma should marry his youngest daughter Akane, despite learning about the curse. However, Akane is known for hating boys, and is a skilled martial artist herself. Ranma is now unwillingly engaged to Akane, who he has to try and get along with amidst the chaos of his transforming curse. Together, they encounter new rivals, love interests, and lots of trouble as Ranma aims to find a cure and continue his martial arts training. Their engagement constantly hangs over their heads, leading to a hilarious and wild adventure full of anger, arguments, and accidental mishaps due to Ranma's condition.",
