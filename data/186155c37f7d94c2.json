    "text": "Genma Saotome and his son, Ranma, are skilled martial artists who stumble upon a curse during their training in China. After falling into a magical spring at Jusenkyo, Ranma is now cursed to transform into a beautiful red-headed woman whenever splashed with cold water, reverting back to his male form only when doused in hot water.\n\nAs if this curse weren't enough, Genma has arranged for Ranma to marry Akane Tendo, one of the three daughters of Soun Tendo, in order to preserve the future of the Tendo dojo. Despite knowing about Ranma's predicament, Soun insists on proceeding with the engagement, choosing his youngest daughter, Akane, who is a talented martial artist herself and is known for her disdain towards men.\n\nRanma Â½ follows the comedic and action-packed adventures of Ranma and Akane as they navigate their engagement, encounter various adversaries, and explore new romantic interests, all while trying to find a cure for Ranma's curse. With a blend of humor, romance, and martial arts, this anime promises to keep you entertained and engaged.",
