    "text": "After unleashing the Death Force war machines that have ravaged the planet Jerra, the mighty soldier Geist finds himself working to dismantle the very weapons he helped activate. But a new opponent arises - Krauser, a fellow elite Most Dangerous Soldier (MDS) who believes only he can save humanity. Seeking fame and power for himself, Krauser has rallied a pocket of human survivors against the marauding Death Force robots that continue to hunt down and exterminate mankind. With Geist confronting Krauser and endless killer machines hounding them at every turn, humanity's hopes appear bleak. Yet two of the planet's most formidable soldiers are about to clash, with the very fate of Jerra and its people hanging in the balance. This sequel to the original MD Geist anime promises intense action and high stakes as Geist battles both man and machine alike in his own inimitable style. Will humanity survive? Can anyone or anything stop the Death Force?",
