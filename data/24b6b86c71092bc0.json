    "text": "It's 1874 in Tokyo, and Shizuma Origasa, a former samurai turned rickshaw driver, is on a relentless quest to find his missing fianc√©e, Sumie Kanomata, who disappeared during the Boshin War. After inadvertently preventing an assassination attempt on a high-ranking official, Shizuma finds himself entangled with the local police force and embroiled in a dangerous conspiracy aiming to overthrow the government. Meanwhile, the Moriya yakuza clan, with ties to the mastermind behind the plot, welcomes a skilled one-eyed swordsman, Kyoushirou Shuragami, who seeks personal gain amidst the chaos. As Shizuma navigates the complex web of power struggles and betrayals, he will cross paths with Kyoushirou, leading to a series of fateful and ironic encounters that will alter their destinies forever.",
