  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Saint Marguerite Academy, a prestigious institution nestled in the small European country of Sauville, welcomes Kazuya Kujou, a Japanese exchange student. With his dark hair and eyes, Kazuya is quickly labeled as the 'Black Reaper,' a figure from local folklore, leaving him isolated from his peers. In search of ghost stories to connect with his classmates, Kazuya stumbles upon a golden strand of hair that leads him to the academy's lavish library and a secret garden. Here, he encounters Victorique de Blois, a doll-like girl with a remarkable ability to solve mysteries by weaving facts and knowledge together.\n\nAs fate intertwines their lives, Kazuya and Victorique find themselves drawn into a series of enigmatic cases, from ghost ships to alchemists with transmutation powers. Victorique's unique insights and Kazuya's determination make them a formidable team, as they navigate through these chilling and dangerous mysteries. Despite the meddling of the self-important Inspector Gr√©vil, who seeks to exploit Victorique's talents, the duo perseveres, unraveling secrets that prove far more perilous than they initially anticipated. As they delve deeper into these cases, a sinister plot unfolds, threatening to disrupt their newfound friendship and the tranquility of their academic haven.",
