    "text": "Manpuku Geinou Production, a struggling entertainment company, launches an unorthodox idol group called the Eternal Boys. Comprised of six men in their 40s, the Eternal Boys aim to overcome barriers like their age and lack of physical conditioning to achieve success in the competitive idol industry. The group includes former professional soccer player Haru Asai, presenter Makoto Kakizaki, former pop star Tsuyoshi, talent agent Daisuke Yamanaka, office worker Kentarou Yamada, and teacher Naoki Ishida. With diverse backgrounds spanning highs like fame and lows like failure, these seasoned middle-aged men face significant hurdles as they strive to learn the ropes of idol performance. By pushing boundaries of tradition, the Eternal Boys represent an underdog story of determination. Their journey tests whether old dogs can learn new tricks to find the spotlight, proving one is never too old to shine. Manpuku Geinou Production banks on the group's underdog appeal to revive the agency's own struggles. Through experiences of rising up after each fall, the Eternal Boys vow to take a stand.",
