  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Along side his simian companion, Bao, the treasure hunter Kim scours the Rido Galaxy, constantly seeking valuable artifacts while evading the ruthless, life-exterminating Inorganics. Meanwhile, on the once-thriving planet of Aqualoid, now a desolate wasteland due to the Inorganics' onslaught, a young man named Nam stumbles upon a mystical sword imbued with crystallized light energy called Shade.\n\nWith the universe teetering on the brink of a new evolutionary stage, the cosmos has become a breeding ground for both organic and inorganic life. The Inorganics, a cancer-like entity, threaten to eradicate all organic life, leaving Nam and his growing group of allies as the last line of defense.\n\nJoined by the resourceful mechanic Rasa, her creature Monga, and a motley crew of space-faring rogues, Nam must wield the enigmatic sword and confront the Inorganics. The fate of the universe rests in their hands, as they strive to safeguard their world or pave the way for a new beginning. The cost may be high, but hope lingers in the balance.",
