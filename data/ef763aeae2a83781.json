  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Velonica is a self-centered alien girl from the distant planet Metrotopia, where she is the wealthy heiress to Galaxy Network, the largest communication service in the universe. When the company looks to expand its coverage to Earth, an underdeveloped world by Velonica's standards, she travels there on a mission to install a giant antenna and connect the planet to the Galaxy Network. Upon arriving on Earth, the pragmatic Velonica struggles to make sense of the inhabitants' illogical activities and lack of a unified leadership. But her mission is soon challenged when she has a fateful encounter with Konpei, an Earth boy who opens her eyes to human relationships, laughter, and other unnecessary stuff she has long dismissed. As Velonica spends more time with Konpei, she finds herself wavering between pursuing a potential romance with him and dedicating herself solely to the arts and expanding her father's intergalactic business empire.",
