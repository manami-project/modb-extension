  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lamperouge's ambitions to dismantle the Holy Britannian Empire are on the brink of collapse in the third and final installment of the Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion film trilogy, which also encompasses the events of Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. With his sister, Nunnally, held captive by Schneizel el Britannia and his appeals for help to Suzaku Kururugi falling on deaf ears, Lelouch's leadership of the Black Knights is being questioned. The United Federation of Nations has declared war on Britannia, further complicating matters. After enduring numerous acts of treachery, a diminished influence, and a growing animosity towards Emperor Charles zi Britannia, the beleaguered Lelouch makes a daring decision: if he cannot bring down the Empire from without, he will seize control from within. This film serves as the culmination of the 3-part theatrical remake of the first two seasons of the original anime series.",
