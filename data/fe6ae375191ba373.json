    "text": "The film concludes the theatrical remake of the anime series Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion and Code Geass: Lelouch of the Rebellion R2. Protagonist Lelouch Lamperouge's plans to overthrow the tyrannical Holy Britannian Empire are unraveling. His sister Nunnally has been abducted by Britannian prince Schneizel el Britannia. Meanwhile, Suzaku Kururugi refuses to help Lelouch despite their past camaraderie. Doubts about Lelouch's leadership grow among his Black Knight followers as Britannia wages global war. After enduring repeated betrayals and the loss of critical allies, a desperate Lelouch hatches a bold new scheme - if he can't defeat Britannia from the outside, he will seize control from within by gaining influence over the imperial family. This film brings closure to the theatrical remake trilogy adapting the anime's first two seasons. Lelouch reaches a climactic juncture in his quest to topple Britannia at all costs amidst shifting loyalties and a world at war.",
