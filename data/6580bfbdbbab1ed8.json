    "text": "Valkyries soar through the cosmos once more in A.D. 2089, eight decades after the Zentraedi war, as Earth finds itself threatened by a new alien menace: the Marduk. The Super Dimensional Fortress Macross, now a museum, must awaken from its slumber to face this formidable enemy. Amidst the chaos of the first battle, rookie reporter Hibiki Kanzaki stumbles upon Ishtar, a captivating Marduk songstress whose melodies can sway the tide of war.\n\nDetermined to protect Ishtar and teach her about humanity, Hibiki brings her back to Earth. Together with skilled Valkyrie pilot Silvie Gena, they embark on a mission to save Earth from the Marduk's wrath, led by the ruthless Lord Ingues. As the Marduk's true intentions unfold, Hibiki and his allies must navigate a web of interstellar politics and military opposition to expose the truth and harness the ancient power of the Macross.\n\nIn a desperate bid to prevent Earth's annihilation, Hibiki seeks to use Ishtar's extraordinary abilities to reactivate the Macross. With the fate of the planet hanging in the balance, the unlikely trio must unite to stand against the Marduk and prove that the power of love and understanding can transcend the boundaries of war.",
