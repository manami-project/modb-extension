    "text": "Ray of Gold, a captivating melody by Sangatsu no Phantasia, serves as the opening theme for the enthralling anime, Ryza no Atelier: Tokoyami no Joou to Himitsu no Kakurega. This enchanting tune, musically orchestrated and directed by Harumaki Gohan, was brought to life in an animated music video released on July 2, 2023. A week later, fans were treated to a Vocaloid rendition of the same song, featuring the digital diva Hatsune Miku, on Harumaki Gohan's YouTube channel. The mesmerizing animation remains consistent in both versions, perfectly complementing the alluring music and setting the tone for the anime's enchanting journey.",
