  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Morisawa Riko, a young girl from Tokorozawa, embarks on an unexpected journey when a simple trip to Tokyo leads her to purchase an LBX action figure. Unbeknownst to her, the figure she chooses, named \"Assassin,\" catapults her into a parallel universe where mechanical beings known as Mimesis threaten the safety of Earth. In this new world, LBX action figures are not just toys, but real armored weaponry worn by girls to combat the hostile Mimesis.\n\nRiko soon discovers her ability to don an LBX armor and joins forces with four other girls who, like her, are from her world. The anime's story is based on the rebooted version of the Soukou Musume Mizel Rem Crisis game, and follows the girls' quest to defeat the Mimesis and find their way back home.\n\nAs a member of the combat unit 'Soukou Musume,' Riko and her newfound friends face numerous challenges and develop strong bonds while protecting humanity from the metallic creatures that invade their world. Will they be able to save the planet and return to their own world? Only time will tell.",
