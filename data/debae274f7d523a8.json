    "text": "Shining amongst the planets of the Sakura Cosmos is Granbell, a once-thriving theme park now abandoned and inhabited solely by machines. Amongst these mechanical beings, a lone human, Shiki Granbell, thrives, having been adopted by the late robot king, Ziggy. Yearning for Shiki's departure to explore the universe and preserve him from the inevitable shutdown of his robotic friends, Ziggy's wish comes to fruition with the arrival of the adventurous Rebecca Bluegarden and her feline companion, Happy.\n\nAs the first visitors in a century, their presence sparks a robot uprising, forcing Shiki to embark on a cosmic journey with his new friends. Aboard the Edens Zero, Ziggy's former spaceship, the trio seeks the enigmatic Mother while reuniting the legendary Four Shining Stars, the vessel's original crew. From master storyteller Hiro Mashima, creator of Fairy Tail and Rave Master, comes a thrilling space odyssey filled with action, friendship, and the occasional blue cat. Join Shiki and his companions as they traverse the cosmos in search of new experiences, friends, and the elusive Mother.",
