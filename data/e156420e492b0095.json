    "text": "Kuromi, the dedicated Production Desk Manager at Studio Petit, is back and facing her biggest challenge yet. After the success of Time's Journey 2, the studio is now juggling three anime series simultaneously, pushing the team to their limits. As the pressure mounts, the studio's owner brings in Takashimadaira, a seasoned producer known for his strict adherence to deadlines. However, his relentless focus on meeting these deadlines compromises the quality of the animation, causing friction within the team. With morale at an all-time low and the quality of their work at stake, Kuromi must navigate this tumultuous situation and make a tough decision: prioritize the deadline or uphold the quality of their productions. Can Kuromi and her team rise to the occasion and deliver, or will the pressure prove too much to handle?",
