    "text": "Neuroi, an enigmatic alien race, continues to pose a threat to humanity, but the defense lines have managed to maintain a fragile peace. Yoshika Miyafuji, a Fuso Witch and former member of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, has been focusing on her medical studies in Lausanne. However, the tranquility is disrupted when Mio Sakamoto pays her a visit, hinting at trouble brewing at sea. Yoshika, eager to contribute to the war effort, rushes to the North Sea, marking the start of the Strike Witches' reunion. Their mission: to liberate Europe from the Neuroi's clutches, with the capital city of the Empire of Karlsland, Berlin, being their primary target. With the Neuroi's ability to adapt to the battlefield daily, the allied forces face a daunting challenge. Will the current state of Striker technology and the reunited witches of the 501st Joint Fighter Wing be enough to secure victory? Join the Strike Witches, now bolstered by the addition of Shizuka Hattori, as they embark on a final, epic battle to reclaim Berlin and safeguard humanity's future.",
