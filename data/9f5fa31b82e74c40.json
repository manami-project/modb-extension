  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuri Plisetsky, a 15-year-old competitive figure skater nicknamed the \"Russian Fairy\", seeks to shake off his cute image in an exhibition performance at the Grand Prix Final in Barcelona. As a bonus feature on the 6th DVD/Blu-ray volume of the anime series Yuri!!! on Ice, this OVA focuses solely on Plisetsky's shocking new routine - an intense, rebellious program titled \"Welcome to the Madness.\" Seeking to showcase a more mature side of his skating, Plisetsky unveils dangerously fierce choreography and costume choices unlike anything he's attempted in competition before. His edgy, punk-rock number aims to surprise both the Barcelona crowd and his fellow skaters, defying all expectations for the young prodigy. Will Plisetsky's bold artistic gambit pay off, or will the risk prove too great on the grand stage of the Grand Prix Final exhibition?",
