    "text": "Solar system police recruitment takes an unexpected turn when Chuuta Kokonose, an ordinary orphan living with his aunt, is selected as a potential candidate. Chuuta, who has always heard a mysterious voice in his head, is transported to a fantastical space police station filled with extraordinary creatures after being followed home by a peculiar entity. Rein Brickke, the Chief of the Solar System Department, reveals Chuuta's potential candidacy, much to the disbelief of Misuzu Sonokata, a subordinate with an angelic appearance and a fiery temperament. As a classmate of Chuuta, Misuzu doubts his suitability for the role. However, urged by the voice in his head and driven by the desire to prove Misuzu wrong, Chuuta decides to take the aptitude test, embarking on a journey that challenges the notion of his sanity and leads him to discover an alien presence within him.",
