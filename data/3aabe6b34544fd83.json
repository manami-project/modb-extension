  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime tells the story of Itsuki, an ordinary high school boy who finds himself in an extraordinary situation. A few years ago, a devastating virus spread globally, rendering all men except Itsuki impotent. To keep his rare ability a secret, Itsuki transfers to a new high school that is almost entirely female. Here he encounters a diverse group of girls who react to his situation in their own way - from an upbeat senior who tries to help him fit in, to a teacher frustrated by her lack of intimacy, to a feisty tomboy and a wealthy heiress who see him as a romantic prospect. Itsuki must navigate complex relationships and attention unlike anything he's ever experienced, all while deciding how to responsibly handle being the only virile man in a world of four billion women. This harem sci-fi anime blends an engaging premise with moments of comedy, fanservice and drama. At its heart is a thoughtful exploration of gender dynamics in a society turned upside down.",
