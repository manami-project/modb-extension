    "text": "In the town of Dondon, a cunning cat named Pero has made a risky wager with the wealthy pig Gourmont. If Pero can circumnavigate the globe in just 80 days, he will win Gourmont's entire fortune. However, if he fails, Pero will lose his freedom and be enslaved by Gourmont for life. Eager to protect his riches, the unscrupulous Gourmont dispatches his assistant Dr. Garigari to obstruct Pero's journey by any means necessary. Pero also faces trouble from three hostile tomcats chasing him. Fortunately, Pero has loyal companions by his side - his friends the mighty Kato and a brave little mouse. Beset by sabotage and with the clock ticking, Pero remains determined to complete his worldwide voyage within 80 days and claim Gourmont's wealth. But will deceit and peril along the way prove too great for Pero and his friends? The high-stakes race around the world has begun!",
