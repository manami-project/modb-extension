  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuusuke is a college-age boy who has a severe phobia of women, stemming from a childhood trauma where his twin neighbors Yuika and Rika tried to injure him. Yuusuke's father is a gynecologist who wants Yuusuke to overcome his fear so he can eventually take over the family medical practice. To help with this, Yuusuke's father arranges for Yuika and Rika, now young women attending the local college, to stay at their home. With the twins living under the same roof, they go to great lengths trying to cure Yuusuke's phobia using overtly sexual tactics. Both Rika, the more reserved twin, and the brazen Yuika compete for Yuusuke's affection through seduction, hoping to win his heart. This uncomfortable arrangement leads to racy antics as Yuusuke deals with the twins' forceful advances and abundant nudity. Despite the nonstop sexual onslaught, Yuusuke starts developing complex feelings for the twins. The story explores whether Yuusuke can overcome his deep-rooted fear and how this unique living situation with Yuika and Rika will resolve.",
