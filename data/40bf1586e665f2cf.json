    "text": "Yusuke Yamamoto's life takes a chaotic turn when he finds himself living under the same roof as two enamored twin sisters, Yuka and Rika. Plagued by a deep-seated fear of women, Yusuke's father, a gynecologist, hopes that cohabitation with the twins will help cure his son's phobia. The twins, who have harbored feelings for Yusuke since he saved them from a dog years ago, seize this opportunity to win his heart. As the competition between the bold Yuka and the reserved Rika intensifies, Yusuke must navigate a whirlwind of seduction, temptation, and the relentless pursuit of love. Will Yusuke overcome his fear and find love amidst this storm, or will he succumb to the overwhelming pressure?",
