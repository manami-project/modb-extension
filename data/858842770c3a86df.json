    "text": "Japan's national soccer team boasts a young prodigy named Aoyama, who is not only incredibly talented but also strikingly handsome. With his exceptional skills on the field, he has earned the admiration of many. However, Aoyama has an unusual quirk - he is a germaphobe, which makes soccer, a sport known for its physicality, an unexpected choice. Playing as the midfielder for Fujimi High School's soccer club, Aoyama navigates the game with a unique style, avoiding any physical contact and dribbling his way to victory. Despite his aversion to dirt and germs, Aoyama is determined to lead his underdog team to the National Championships, alongside his teammate, the powerful striker Kaoru Zaizen. Aoyama's unwavering dedication to cleanliness, even during throw-ins where he insists on wearing gloves, makes him an intriguing figure on the field. His journey to balance his phobia with his passion for soccer promises a captivating watch.",
