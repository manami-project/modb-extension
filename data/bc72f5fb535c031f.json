    "text": "Follow the enigmatic journey of Black Jack, an unlicensed surgeon whose extraordinary skills are whispered about in secret corners of the medical world. A maverick with a dark edge, Black Jack operates outside the confines of the law, performing medical feats that border on the supernatural. Draped in a black cape, this brooding figure is a medical rogue who plays by his own rules, bound only by his commitment to the Hippocratic Oath.\n\nFrom wealthy tycoons grappling with inexplicable ailments to militant guerrillas desperate to keep their leader alive, Black Jack's clientele is as diverse as it is desperate. His services, however, come at a steep price. Yet, for those teetering on the brink of death, Black Jack is their last hope, a man who will challenge death itself to save a life. Leave a message with your condition and the amount you can afford, and perhaps this mysterious surgeon will answer your call.",
