Saya Tokido meets Riki by chance on a school rooftop at night. She is escaping some dangerous pursuers called the \"Dark Executives.\" Though initially suspicious of Riki, Saya asks for his help finding a secret treasure in a dungeon under the school. However, the Dark Executives chase them at every turn. Riki also encounters his classmate Sasami Sasasegawa, who has the supernatural ability to transform into a cat. This causes chaos that Riki helps resolve. In the process, he discovers there is more to her power than meets the eye. Kanata Futaki joins the Little Busters baseball team at Kyousuke's urging. As Riki spends time assisting her with paperwork, he notices unexplained scars on her arms and realizes she is hiding a deeper story. Through befriending Saya, Sasami, and Kanata, Riki becomes entangled in thrilling adventures layered with mystery. His willingness to help the girls earns their trust and brings intrigue into the Little Busters' lives.",
