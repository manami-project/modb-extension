  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Although Futaba Igarashi relishes her job at a reputable trading company, her senior colleague, Harumi Takeda, often makes her life challenging. Takeda's towering stature, boisterous laughter, and tendency to treat Igarashi like a child due to her petite size irritate her to no end. However, Takeda's dependable nature and thoughtful gestures, such as aiding her during work crises or caring for her during illness, leave Igarashi conflicted about her true feelings for him. As they spend more time together, their relationship evolves beyond mere coworkers, leading to a mix of comedic misunderstandings and tender moments that make Igarashi question if her annoyance is the only emotion she feels for Takeda.",
