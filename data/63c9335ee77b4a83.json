    "text": "Fen and Miao, the dynamic siblings at the heart of this anime, are back with their unique blend of love and rivalry. The brother's absurd behavior continues to exasperate his sister, while he strives to break free from her often violent hold. Despite their seemingly dysfunctional relationship, their bond as siblings remains unshakable. As the story unfolds, the narrative expands to include their friends and classmates, who add their own flavor to the mix. Amidst the chaos and laughter, themes of sibling love, romantic love, and the joy of food are beautifully woven into the tapestry of this engaging anime.",
