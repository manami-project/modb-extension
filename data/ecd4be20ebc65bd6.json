  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Koyuki Honda, an orphaned high school graduate, yearns to turn back the hands of time and reunite with her deceased brother. When she encounters the enigmatic Putin brothers, Victor and Kiri, at her brother's gravesite, they introduce her to a hidden world where time-devouring demons, known as Horologues, prey on human regrets. Lured by the legend of the cemetery's clock tower, Koyuki becomes bait for one such demon, only to be saved by the time-manipulating abilities of the Putin brothers. As members of the elite group of warriors known as Chronos Rulers, Victor, Kiri, and their fellow fighters Mina and Blaze, use their Oaths of Time to combat these demons and protect humanity from the consequences of their desires to alter the past. With her regret laid to rest, Koyuki moves forward, leaving the ongoing battle against the Horologues in the capable hands of the Chronos Rulers.",
