    "text": "Mediterranean island Regalo thrives under the watchful eye of the Arcana Famiglia, a mafia-like group with a twist: their members wield supernatural abilities granted by tarot cards. Led by Mondo, the family has kept the island safe from danger and corruption. However, Mondo's retirement sparks an extraordinary competition, the Arcana Duello, to determine his successor. The winner will not only become the new leader but also marry Mondo's daughter, Felicitá.\n\nUnwilling to be a mere prize, Felicitá enters the tournament alongside her friends and fellow Arcana users, Liberta and Nova. As they prepare for the competition, they reflect on their past experiences and continue to strengthen their unique powers. Felicitá, determined to forge her own destiny, strives to emerge victorious and secure her freedom.\n\nWith the future of the Arcana Famiglia and Felicitá's hand in marriage at stake, the Arcana Duello promises intense rivalries and unexpected alliances. As the competition unfolds, the bonds between Felicitá, Liberta, and Nova will be tested, and secrets from their pasts may come to light. Will Felicitá succeed in shaping her own path, or will she ultimately be bound by the rules of the Arcana Famiglia?",
