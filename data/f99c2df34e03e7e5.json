  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A Japanese stop-motion animated short film directed by acclaimed animator Kihachiro Kawamoto depicts the humorous yet thought-provoking struggle between an artist and his creation. When a sculptor molds a beautiful female figure out of clay, his sculpture suddenly springs to life and gains autonomy. Rejecting the artist's vision, the animated sculpture insists on reshaping its creator, leading to a comedic yet philosophical back-and-forth as artist and art argue over who gets to determine the final product. This clever commentary on artistic agency and the relationship between creator and created packs potent themes into a brief runtime. With its unique premise brought to life through meticulous stop-motion techniques, the film promises to surprise and delight animation fans interested in Kawamoto's signature wit and visual style.",
