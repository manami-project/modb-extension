  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This 19th century tale follows Wisteria, a lonely orphan girl forced to beg on the streets of England. Her only solace is found in the companionship of Marbas, an immortal demon to whom she can see past his human disguise. Though from vastly different worlds, they find kinship in each other's loneliness. Their unlikely bond draws the attention of the Sword Cross Knights, a brutal order dedicated to exterminating demons. With Wisteria's own brother among their ranks, she and Marbas must evade them or risk paying a steep price. Together, demon and girl travel in search of a place they might call home - one where outcasts like themselves can find happiness. But through encounters both beautiful and dangerous, they discover the cost such belonging may require. United by hardship, can these two lost souls find in each other the family they've always longed for? Or will the forces that oppose their bond ultimately tear them apart?",
