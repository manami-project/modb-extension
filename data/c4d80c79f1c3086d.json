  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Miyuki and Natsumi, two talented and determined police officers, have recently transferred to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD). As they settle into their new precinct, they begin investigating a series of unusual luxury car thefts. However, the case takes a personal turn when Miyuki's own beloved vintage yellow Ford Mustang is stolen right from under her. Through their investigation, Miyuki and Natsumi uncover that the brazen thief is shockingly someone familiar - a former Japanese policeman turned rogue criminal. Undeterred, the odd couple duo ramp up their pursuit, willing to take down even a former colleague in the name of justice. They uncover the thief's modus operandi - stealing luxury vehicles, re-tuning them, and selling them illegally for profit. With Miyuki's Mustang on the line, the stakes are raised. The usually bubbly Miyuki loses her patience, while the tough Natsumi takes no prisoners. The thief may be clever, but he's just met his match with these unrelenting officers. Their unorthodox partnership and refusal to back down set the stage for an epic takedown in the heart of LA's bustling streets. Can they reclaim the Mustang and restore order in the city? One thing's for sure - with Miyuki and Natsumi on the case, the car thief's days on the run are numbered.",
