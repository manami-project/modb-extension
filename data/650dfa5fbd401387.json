  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fussa is a city located just outside of Tokyo that features a blend of modern conveniences and traditional charm. The city has train access to bustling urban centers like Shinjuku, yet retains its small-town feel with sights like sake breweries, riverside scenery, and architecture from past eras. The story follows Kaori, an employee at an international IT firm in Tokyo who struggles to balance her overseas experiences with Japanese business customs. When her idea to serve local sake at a company event is rejected, a colleague encourages her to visit Fussa's sake breweries just an hour away. There, Kaori discovers the care and craftsmanship that goes into this traditional drink. Her journey both educates and inspires her on how to incorporate her global perspective into Japanese business culture. Interwoven is the experience of Matsuko, an assistant film director scouting locations for an upcoming shoot. Veteran directors introduce her to Fussa, where she gets a tour from a local resident. Through Matsuko's eyes, we see Fussa's blend of modern and traditional, and how the city's sights range from cozy neighborhood bars to cinematic riverside views. Both women rediscover the charms right in Tokyo's backyard, from centuries-old sake making to Fussa's potential as a rising film location. Their stories highlight the city's unique fusion of new and old, urban and rural, traditional practices and contemporary creativity.",
