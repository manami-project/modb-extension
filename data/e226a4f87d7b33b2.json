    "text": "In a post-apocalyptic world devastated by nuclear war, Kenshirou is the successor to the deadly Hokuto Shinken martial arts style. He is betrayed and left for dead by his friend Shin, who has kidnapped Kenshirou's fianc√©e Yuria. As Kenshirou wanders the wasteland on a quest to rescue Yuria and get revenge, he defends the helpless from violent oppressors using his fighting skills. Kenshirou's exploits soon bring him into conflict with numerous rivals and enemies, including other martial artists from schools like Nanto Seiken, as well as tyrants and warlords who control the scattered remnants of civilization. His ultimate rival becomes his eldest brother Raoh, a conquering warlord who seeks to subjugate the world and does not consider Kenshirou a worthy Hokuto Shinken successor. With the odds increasingly stacked against him, Kenshirou must utilize the secret deadly techniques of Hokuto Shinken to overcome all manner of foes in his mission to defeat Shin, reclaim his lost love Yuria, and bring justice to the violent world left in the wake of nuclear armageddon.",
