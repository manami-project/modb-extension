    "text": "Although Negi has survived his first year as a teacher, his troubles are far from over as he becomes the center of attention during Class 2-A's spring break trip to a stunning island. To make matters worse, Asuna is furious with Negi for telling her that she has no role in his magical studies. As Asuna's friends attempt to help them make amends, the situation becomes increasingly complicated. Meanwhile, Ayaka, the class president, sees this as an opportunity to win Negi's favor by inviting him to her family's island. However, the plan quickly backfires as the entire class decides to tag along. Will Ayaka be able to make the most of her chance, or will her classmates once again ruin her plans? With beach balls, bikinis, and magic at every turn, this island vacation is anything but ordinary.",
