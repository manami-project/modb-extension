  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2199, the Earth faces an existential threat from the alien race Gamilas, who have bombarded the planet's surface to near destruction. With humanity on the brink of extinction, a glimmer of hope arrives in a message from the distant planet Iscandar. They offer a device that can restore Earth to its former state - but it must be retrieved within a year, before all life perishes. Assembling a brave crew, the advanced spacecraft Yamato embarks on a perilous 148,000 light-year journey across the galaxy to Iscandar and back. Among the Yamato's untested officers are Susumu Kodai and Daisuke Shima, serving under the command of Captain Okita Juuzou. Beset by Gamilas forces, technical challenges, and the ticking clock, the crew must summon immense courage to achieve their mission and save humanity. Blending action, drama and hope, this anime follows the Yamato on an epic quest to retrieve the cure for Earth's destruction at the hands of a merciless foe. Overcoming adversity, the inexperienced crew battles for the survival of their homeworld and learns what it truly means to be heroes.",
