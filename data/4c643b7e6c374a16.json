  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an underground world beneath a busy sidewalk, there lives a lonely garbage bag. Having no job, family, or place to call home, he leads a solitary existence out of sight from the countless people passing by above. One day, a chance encounter connects the garbage bag's subterranean realm to the lively world above ground. As he forges more connections, the garbage bag begins to discover friendship, purpose, and community - things he has lacked all this time stuck underground alone. Through heartwarming and humorous experiences with the people and objects that filter down to him, the once-isolated garbage bag gains a new appreciation for life and his place in making the world above brighter. His story illustrates how even someone living on the margins can find fulfillment and hope when embraced as part of the broader fabric of humanity. Uplifting and imaginative, this poignant anime uses whimsy and insight to explore the basic human desires for purpose, belonging, and connection. As the garbage bag transforms from castaway to contributor, audiences of all ages will be charmed while gaining perspective on their own role in society.",
