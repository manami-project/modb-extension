  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyouko Hori seems to have it all - she's beautiful, smart, and popular at school. However, at home it's a different story. With her parents often away for work, Hori is left to take care of her younger brother and manage the household responsibilities alone, leaving little time for a social life. Izumi Miyamura keeps a lower profile at school, coming off as a quiet, bookish type. But underneath his unassuming exterior, he hides surprising secrets - a body covered in tattoos and piercings that he keeps concealed from his classmates. When Hori and Miyamura unexpectedly meet outside of school, they're surprised to discover each other's hidden sides. Despite their differences, they find themselves drawn to one another. As an unlikely friendship blossoms into something more, these two opposites realize they share an understanding of living double lives. Balancing part-time jobs, chores, family pressures, and their deepening relationship, Hori and Miyamura support each other through life's ups and downs. Their worlds may seem incompatible on the surface, but perhaps these two outcasts have finally found where they belong - by each other's side.",
