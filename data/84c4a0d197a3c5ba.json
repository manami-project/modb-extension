  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Miyamura’s gloomy demeanor and Hori’s social butterfly persona couldn't be more different, but beneath the surface, they share a secret life that draws them together. Hori, a model student admired for her charm and intellect, hides the responsibility of caring for her younger brother and managing the household while her parents are away. Miyamura, perceived as a quiet and aloof otaku, conceals his kind heart, multiple piercings, and tattoos behind his long hair and long-sleeved clothes. A chance encounter outside of school reveals their hidden selves to each other, sparking an unexpected friendship. As they spend more time together, they discover shared experiences and unveil parts of themselves they've never shown to anyone else, nurturing a bond that could potentially blossom into something more profound.",
