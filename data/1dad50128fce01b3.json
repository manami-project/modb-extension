    "text": "Flowers carrying the scent of the moon, a legend of paradise, and wolves walking among us - this is the world where Kiba, a lone wolf, embarks on a quest to find the mythical utopia. Believed to be extinct for centuries, wolves have been secretly living among humans, disguising themselves to avoid detection. Kiba, Hige, Tsume, and Toboe are drawn together by the alluring aroma of Lunar Flowers, which is said to hold the key to unlocking paradise.\n\nIn a crumbling city ruled by the ruthless Lord Orkham, the wolves meet Cheza, a girl who emanates the scent they've been searching for. However, their journey is fraught with danger, as they are pursued by power-hungry humans and the enigmatic Darcia, who seeks Cheza for his own sinister purposes.\n\nWith their unique personalities and desires, the group of outcast wolves must learn to work together to overcome the challenges that lie ahead. As they traverse desolate landscapes and decaying cities, they grow closer to finding the paradise they've been searching for - but will they be able to protect Cheza and unlock the door to their ideal world before it's too late? Only time will tell if their noble spirits and unwavering determination will lead them to the paradise they seek.",
