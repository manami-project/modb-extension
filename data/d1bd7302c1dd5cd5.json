    "text": "February 29, 2000, marked a turning point in human history when Möbius meteorites descended upon Earth, carrying a unique substance called Möbius Dust. This extraordinary material integrated into the atmosphere, sparking miraculous occurrences. The day of the meteorites' arrival became known as '2.29' and signaled the beginning of escalating economic disparity in Japan.\n\nIn response to the growing wealth gap, a disgruntled faction known as the Bloody War Alliance resorted to acts of terrorism to voice their dissent. To counteract this threat, the police force established a specialized unit and a training school to prepare its members for the fight against terrorism.\n\nThe anime follows the journey of these individuals as they strive to maintain order amidst chaos, exploring the complexities of a society grappling with the consequences of a supernatural event and the widening economic divide.",
