    "text": "Haseo, a formidable Player Killer Killer known as the 'Terror of Death' in the online MMORPG, The World:R2, finds his life turned upside down when his friend Shino falls into a coma after being player killed by the enigmatic Tri-Edge. Desperate for revenge and a cure for Shino's condition, Haseo embarks on a perilous journey to track down Tri-Edge and uncover the truth behind the dangerous virus AIDA that lurks within the game.\n\nAfter a devastating defeat by Azure Kite, who Haseo mistakes for Tri-Edge, he is stripped of his power and left with more questions than answers. Rising from the ashes, Haseo acquires the Avatar of Skeith, granting him the ability to Data Drain his enemies and setting him on the path to become an Epitaph User â€“ one of the few players capable of defeating AIDA.\n\nAlongside newfound allies, including the persistent Atolli and Project G.U. members Pi and Kuhn, Haseo battles against the odds to save both The World and his dear friend Shino from the clutches of AIDA and the elusive Tri-Edge. As they delve deeper into the mystery, Haseo must confront his past, forge new bonds, and unravel the secrets behind the game-induced comas plaguing its players. The fate of The World hangs in the balance, and Haseo's journey will reveal the true power of friendship and determination.",
