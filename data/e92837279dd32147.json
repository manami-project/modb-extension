    "text": "Mayu Morita, a high school student, finds herself in a peculiar predicament. Raised by her mother to be courteous and articulate, she often finds herself lost in thought, carefully considering her words before speaking. This habit, coupled with her tendency to maintain steady eye contact, has led to a misunderstanding among her peers, who perceive her as overly quiet and reserved.\n\nHowever, Mayu's high school journey is far from solitary. Accompanied by her loquacious friend Miki and the reserved Hana, Mayu navigates the labyrinth of adolescence, her silence a stark contrast to the lively chatter that fills their days. Despite her quiet demeanor, Mayu's life is brimming with joy and camaraderie, proving that words are not the only language of friendship.\n\nOriginally bundled with the special edition of its source material's third volume, this anime offers a glimpse into Mayu's world, revealing the gentle and thoughtful girl behind the misunderstood exterior.",
