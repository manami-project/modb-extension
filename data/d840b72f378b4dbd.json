  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Watanuki Kimihiro, a high school student, is tormented by an unwanted ability to see and attract supernatural creatures known as youkai and ayakashi. His life takes a turn for the extraordinary when he stumbles upon a mysterious shop that grants wishes, owned by the enigmatic and beautiful witch, Ichihara Yuuko. In exchange for ridding him of his supernatural encounters, Yuuko demands Watanuki to work part-time at her shop, engaging in tasks that involve the supernatural and mundane household chores.\n\nAs Watanuki navigates through his new job, he is often joined by his love interest, Kunogi Himawari, and his 'rival', Doumeki Shizuka, at Yuuko's request. Despite Watanuki's annoyance with Doumeki, the trio grows closer as they delve deeper into the strange and wonderful world of the supernatural. The series is interconnected with other works by Clamp, such as Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, through dimensional traveling, adding another layer of complexity and intrigue to Watanuki's adventures.",
