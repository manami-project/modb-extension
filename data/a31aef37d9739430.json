    "text": "Chu Kuangsheng lived in the remote Shiyang Town within the Shenlong Empire. Born weak and unable to cultivate, he became the laughingstock of the town. However, after inheriting his family's ancestral techniques, he rapidly progresses in his training. Though appearing weak on the surface, Chu Kuangsheng has a secret identity - the renowned Kuangzun, a famous martial artist. When his parents disappear under mysterious circumstances, Chu Kuangsheng discovers a collusion within his own Chu clan that may be connected. Adopting his Kuangzun persona, he covertly gathers information and allies. With cunning and two identities, Chu Kuangsheng roots out the traitors in his family. Seeking answers about his missing parents, Chu Kuangsheng leaves Shiyang Town to study at the prestigious Siling Academy. As he trains under masters and follows clues across the land, his name and sword become legendary. Battling heroes and villains alike, Chu Kuangsheng carves his own path to mastery.",
