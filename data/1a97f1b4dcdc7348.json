  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kinda hard to keep a straight face when grotesque monsters are popping up left and right, but Miko Yotsuya is determined to do just that! Once an ordinary high school student with a love for late-night horror shows, Miko's life takes a dramatic turn when she suddenly gains the ability to see terrifying specters that no one else can. Despite the chilling whispers of 'Can you see me?' from these ghastly apparitions, Miko resolves to never acknowledge their presence. But as much as she tries to maintain her composure and carry on with her daily life, the supernatural entities seem to have a knack for making things... complicated. Join Miko in her hilarious and hair-raising journey as she navigates the treacherous waters of high school and the unseen world of the paranormal, all while keeping up the best poker face she can muster. Will she succeed in ignoring the horrors that lurk just beyond our sight, or will the fear eventually get the better of her? Only time will tell in this delightful blend of horror and comedy that is \"Mieruko-chan\".",
