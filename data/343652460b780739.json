  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ghost ly adventures unfold in the seemingly ordinary back alley of a local candy shop, known to all as the 'Alley of Ghosts.' Unbeknownst to most, this alley is home to Gacharico, a friendly ghost, and a host of other spectral beings, each with their own distinct personalities. Only the young Miku, whose family runs the nearby candy shop, is privy to this secret. The capsule toys sold at the shop may appear ordinary, but they house these extraordinary ghosts. In one such adventure, Miku's grandmother misplaces her dentures, leading Miku and her ghostly friends on a mission to retrieve them. This original animation, directed by Kato Michiya and featuring character designs by Asakura Sekai-ichi, promises to inspire awe and evoke a range of emotions in its viewers.",
