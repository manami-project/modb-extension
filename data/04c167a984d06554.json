  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yohko Asagiri, a typical high school student, harbors unspoken affection for a classmate, expressing her feelings through a heartfelt song. However, this melody holds an unexpected power, acting as a bridge to the parallel world of Ashanti. The ruthless ruler of Ashanti, seeking to conquer Yohko's world, believes her song to be the key. As it turns out, the song aligns with an ancient prophecy made by the legendary warrior Leda, who once sealed the realms to protect them. Now, Yohko finds herself entrusted with Leda's legacy, transforming into a powerful warrior alongside her new companions. Their mission: thwart the invading forces, restore balance, and safeguard both worlds. Perhaps Yohko is more extraordinary than she ever imagined.",
