    "text": "After School Dice Club is an anime that follows a group of high school girls who discover a shared love of board games. The story begins when Aya, a lively girl who has just moved to Kyoto, befriends her shy classmate Miki. One day after school, out of curiosity, Aya and Miki decide to follow their student council president Midori. They end up at a specialty board game store called the Dice Club. There, they spontaneously try out an old German board game together. This experience opens up a new world for Miki, an introverted homebody who has never really understood what \"fun\" means. As the girls continue visiting the Dice Club and trying out more games, Miki starts to find joy and meaning through this new hobby. She forms friendships over late afternoons spent rolling dice and moving game pieces. Even Midori, who first appears strict, reveals an enthusiastic passion for gaming. Together, these very different high school girls bond over their shared love of analog games. Their after-school adventures at the Dice Club allow them to find connection and happiness through play. As spring turns to summer in Kyoto, their friendships deepen, fueled by friendly competition, teamwork, and discovery of games from around the world.",
