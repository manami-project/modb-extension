    "text": "In the world of publishing, Ritsu Onodera, a dedicated literary editor, finds himself at a crossroads. Leaving behind his father's company to avoid the shadow of nepotism, he joins Marukawa Shoten, only to be assigned to the shoujo manga division, a genre far from his expertise. His new editor-in-chief, Masamune Takano, is a demanding figure with a seemingly harsh demeanor, making their initial encounters far from pleasant. However, a twist of fate reveals that Takano is Saga, Onodera's high school love who once left him heartbroken. As they navigate the challenging world of manga publishing, old wounds resurface, and the complexities of their past relationship come to the forefront, promising a poignant tale of first love, lost and found.",
