  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around two sisters, Akane and Aoi Aioi, who live in a small mountain town. Thirteen years ago, their parents died in a tragic accident. As a result, Akane gave up her dreams of moving to Tokyo with her boyfriend Shinnosuke Kanemuro to take care of her younger sister Aoi. In the present day, 18-year-old Aoi is an aspiring musician who has always felt indebted to Akane for the sacrifice she made. When Aoi gets invited to perform at a local music festival, it coincides with two significant events. First, Akane's ex-boyfriend Shinnosuke, now 31, returns to town after being away for many years to pursue his music career. Additionally, a teenage version of Shinnosuke mysteriously appears - he has time traveled from 13 years in the past. As the two sisters reconnect with the older Shinnosuke and get to know his younger self, it stirs up old memories and feelings. Aoi finds herself falling for the teenage Shinnosuke, causing her to confront her budding romantic feelings for the first time. Ultimately, the return of both Shinnosukes forces Akane and Aoi to reevaluate the past, their relationship as sisters, and what they truly want for the future.",
