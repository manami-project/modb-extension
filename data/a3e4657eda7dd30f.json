    "text": "In the land of Cruzon, most people can control quartz crystals, using them to power magical abilities and technologies like the giant mobile suits known as Golems. However, Rygart Arrow is an \"un-sorcerer\" - unlike his childhood friends Sigyn and Hodr, the future king and queen of Krisna, he cannot control even a speck of quartz. When tensions escalate into war between Krisna and the Athens Commonwealth, Rygart learns of an ancient, powerful Golem that only an un-sorcerer can pilot. Though conflicted as the Athens forces are led by his friend Zess, Rygart takes control of the ancient weapon. Now, he finds himself thrust onto the battlefield, struggling to end the war between the two nations he cares for.",
