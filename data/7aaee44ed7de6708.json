    "text": "Dr. Lychee is the last surviving member of the Tuffle race, who were wiped out long ago by the Saiyans. Seeking revenge, he creates a machine that will emit Destron gas to destroy all life on Earth. With just 72 hours before the gas is released, the remaining Saiyans - Goku, Vegeta, Gohan and Trunks - must team up with Piccolo to track down Dr. Lychee and destroy the deadly machine. This race-against-time mission will test the heroes to their limits as they battle old enemies brought back by Dr. Lychee's advanced technology. With the fate of Earth hanging in the balance, the Z Fighters must pull together to save their home from complete annihilation.",
