  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Orihara—an information broker with a penchant for mischief—meets his match when he crosses paths with a con artist posing as the infamous Shizuo Heiwajima, the ruler of Ikebukuro's streets. Donning a blond wig and a bartender's outfit, the impostor, Shidzuo Nobusuma, attempts to fool the district's residents into doing his bidding. But as luck would have it, the real Shizuo, known for his slim-fit suit, glossy shades, and casual cigarette, is not far behind. As the two men's fates intertwine, chaos ensues, and a new legend is born on the streets of Ikebukuro. This special episode, which was previewed in several theaters on May 21, 2016, and released with the sixth Blu-ray and DVD volume of Durarara!!x2 Ketsu on July 27, 2016, follows the misadventures of Shidzuo, the man with the worst luck in Ikebukuro.",
