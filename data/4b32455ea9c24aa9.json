    "text": "Shizuo Heiwajima is a famously strong man who rules the streets of Ikebukuro. When an ordinary bartender named Shidzuo Nobusuma hears rumors of Shizuo's power, he hatches a plan to pose as Shizuo to make his own life easier. Donning a blonde wig and shades, Shidzuo ventures into Ikebukuro pretending to be Shizuo, confident he can fool everyone into doing his bidding. However, Shidzuo soon finds his luck running out. While some residents pity or tease the impostor, the real Shizuo will inevitably discover the truth. More dangerously, Shidzuo encounters information broker Izaya Orihara, whose favorite hobby is manipulating Shizuo. As these two men's fates intertwine through Izaya's meddling, chaos and hilarity ensue on Ikebukuro's streets. This special episode, previewed in theaters and released with the Durarara!!x2 Blu-ray, revolves around the outlandish consequences when an unlucky impostor crosses paths with Ikebukuro's strongest man and most mischievous trickster.",
