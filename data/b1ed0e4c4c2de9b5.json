  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Time seems to slow down in the quaint coastal town where Kenji Tomosaka, a young boy, finds himself relocating to with his family. The vast ocean, sparkling like lemonade under the summer sun, captures his heart and leads him to a fateful encounter with his neighbor, Nanami Konoe. Their rooms are a mere stone's throw apart, and as the seasons come and go, their friendship blossoms into something more profound.\n\nDespite the assumptions of those around them, Kenji and Nanami remain hesitant to take their relationship beyond the boundaries of friendship. Their bond, however, is unbreakable, and the memories they create together—both joyous and bittersweet—become an integral part of their lives.\n\nAs the cicadas begin their familiar summer symphony and the sky stretches clear and boundless above them, Kenji and Nanami find themselves on the brink of a summer unlike any other. This season promises change, and as the sun casts its warm glow upon them, they stand together at the precipice of a new chapter in their intertwined lives.",
