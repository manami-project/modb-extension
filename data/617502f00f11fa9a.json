    "text": "In the tranquil facade of Okinawa, Japan, a high school girl named Saya Otonashi lives a seemingly ordinary life, marred only by her inexplicable amnesia and anemia. Unbeknownst to her, a secret war rages in the shadows, a conflict waged by the clandestine organization, Red Shield, against immortal, bloodthirsty creatures known as Chiropterans. These shape-shifting monsters have infiltrated human society, feeding on the unsuspecting populace while maintaining their disguise.\n\nSaya's peaceful existence shatters when a mysterious man, Haji, hands her a katana, triggering a latent power within her. She finds herself inexplicably drawn into Red Shield's struggle, her forgotten past resurfacing as she battles the Chiropterans. As she navigates this dangerous new reality, Saya embarks on a journey to regain her lost memories and uncover her true identity.\n\nWith Haji by her side and the support of her loved ones, Saya must confront her blood-soaked past and find the strength to forge ahead. As she unravels the threads of her forgotten life, she becomes humanity's best hope against the Chiropteran threat. Will Saya unlock the secrets of her past and fulfill her destiny, or will she succumb to the darkness that haunts her memories?",
