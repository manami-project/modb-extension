In this bustling city reside Naomi Katagaki, a reserved and socially awkward boy, and Ruri Ichigyou, a girl with a cool demeanor and a penchant for bluntness. Despite their shared love for literature, Naomi finds Ruri's unapproachable nature intimidating. One day, Naomi witnesses an ethereal crimson aurora streak across the sky, followed by an encounter with a three-legged crow and a mysterious hooded figure. The figure reveals himself to be Naomi from ten years in the future, returning to prevent a tragic event that befalls Ruri shortly after they begin dating. Initially skeptical, Naomi decides to follow his future self's guidance to save Ruri, embarking on a journey to alter the course of destiny. Will Naomi succeed in changing the future?",
