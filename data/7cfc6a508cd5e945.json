  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Working in harmony with John Lennon's heartfelt ballad, 'Oh! Yoko!', this 1973 animated short by Japanese artist Keiichi Tanaami brings to life the enchanting love story of Lennon and his wife, Yoko Ono. The animation, which aired on the late-night television program 11PM, artfully weaves together psychedelic imagery reminiscent of the '60s, playful nods to Lennon's iconic contributions to The Beatles, and whimsical pop caricatures of the celebrity couple. Occasionally, the animation also features appearances from Elvis Presley and the Yellow Submarine, adding a delightful twist to this visual tribute to Lennon's music and love story.",
