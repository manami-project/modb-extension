  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Professor Kaneda, in response to the tragic belief that his son, Shotaro, perished in a Tokyo bombing during World War II, creates Tetsujin, an advanced soldier robot. To prevent military misuse, he conceals the robot on a distant island. Fast forward a decade after the war, Tetsujin is reactivated by Professor Shikishima, Kaneda's successor. Meanwhile, Shotaro, now a skilled detective, teams up with Tetsujin to combat evil forces.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Shotaro discovers he has an older brother, also named Shotaro, who is capable of controlling Tetsujin 28. The elder Shotaro, a surviving soldier from a forgotten unit, returns home after a decade of seclusion, oblivious to the war's end. Simultaneously, a new type of bomb, the Ruin Bomb, is discovered beneath Tokyo. Designed by the late Professor Kaneda, the bomb possesses the ability to annihilate artificial structures across a vast area while sparing living organisms, except for plants. Young Shotaro is left to unravel the true intent behind his father's creation.",
