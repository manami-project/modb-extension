  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This mature anime focuses on an older Condom Battler Goro, set 5 years and 6 months after the original series. Struggling with adulthood, Goro grapples with feeling like a has-been and the legacy of his past condom battling adventures. Presented in short digest episodes, the anime contrasts Goro's over-the-top antics in Condom Battler with a more grounded, somber style. Though only brief segments are released, they are excerpted from a hypothetical full-length series. Split into two one-minute parts, the digests tackle important sexual health themes. The first argues against embarrassment around condom use, while the second warns of the risks of unsafe sex. While more realistic than its predecessor, this revival brings back the beloved Condom Battler hero to impart wisdom to a new generation. With cutting edge animation technology, it promises to conjure nostalgia for fans while speaking to modern viewers.",
