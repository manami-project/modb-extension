    "text": "Butler Goro, the iconic hero of the past, returns in a new series that grapples with the harsh realities of growing up and the lingering echoes of a glorious past. Set in a world five years and six months after Goro's epic battle with Count Gom Sinai, the series takes on a more somber and realistic tone.\n\nThe protagonist wrestles with the feeling of being a 'has-been' and the weight of Goro's legacy. The series is presented in a unique format, with each episode being a digest of a hypothetical 5.6-hour classic anime that doesn't exist.\n\nThe series is divided into two parts, each carrying a powerful message. The first part emphasizes the importance of not feeling embarrassed to wear a condom, while the second part underscores the significance of being able to express the need to wear one. Despite the original 5.6-hour animation being unavailable, the series releases 56-second digest videos for viewers to enjoy.\n\nJoin us in this poignant journey that combines the nostalgia of the past with the complexities of the present, all while promoting a vital message about safe practices.",
