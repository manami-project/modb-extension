  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Despite his love for eggs, pranks, and shunning academics, the charming and adorable King Ou-sama has captured the hearts of countless children in the beloved anime series, Boku wa Ousama. Based on the popular book series by Teruo Teramura and Shizuko Wakayama, which debuted in 1959, this show follows the whimsical misadventures of the lazy yet endearing king. From his quests for elephant eggs to make his favorite omelets to hiding toys in the forest to playfully trick his wise counselors, each episode is filled with delightful antics.\n\nTo add an educational twist, every episode of Boku wa Ousama features a unique hiragana lesson. While the stories in the first six episodes are repeated in episodes seven to twelve, they are paired with different hiragana reading lessons to keep the learning experience fresh and engaging. Despite his self-centered and boastful nature, King Ou-sama's silly and lovable personality has endeared him to generations of children, making Boku wa Ousama a timeless classic.",
