  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Boku wa Ousama is a charming children's anime based on a beloved book series that has delighted young readers in Japan for decades. The stories follow Ou-sama, a silly and gluttonous but good-natured king who spends his days seeking out his favorite food - elephant egg omelets. When not occupied with eating, he plays lighthearted pranks on his exasperated counselors or lazily pedals his bike around the castle grounds. Though selfish and mischievous, Ou-sama's playful spirit and simple wisdom have earned him the affection of children across generations. Each episode brings a new comedic adventure as the king searches for rare ingredients to create his beloved omelets, plays tricks on his advisors to avoid his royal duties, or finds new ways to goof off around the castle. With simple life lessons gently woven in, Boku wa Ousama promises giggles and smiles for viewers of all ages.",
