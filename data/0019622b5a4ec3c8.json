  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ceil Phantomhive, the president of the Funtom Corporation, has planned a charity performance of Hamlet for underprivileged children to commemorate the company's third anniversary. However, when the originally hired theater troupe suffers a maritime accident and cannot make it in time, Ceil enlists his resourceful butler, Sebastian Michaelis, to ensure the play's success. With the promise of media attention, the pair rally an unlikely cast of characters, including Ceil's fianc√©e Elizabeth Midford, his servants, and even some unexpected guests such as the Chinese mafia and a flamboyant shinigami. Despite the challenges posed by this eccentric ensemble, Sebastian is determined to pull off a successful performance, proving once again that he truly is one hell of a butler. Will they be able to stage the play as planned, or will the unpredictable cast lead to chaos?",
