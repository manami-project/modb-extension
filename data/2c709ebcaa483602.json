    "text": "Six months after their last adventure, Captain Tylor and the crew of the Soyokaze face a new threat as the Raalgon Empire develops a dangerous new weapon. Charged with intercepting the weapon during transport, Tylor's questionable leadership leads to the crew's capture. As the hours until their execution tick down, the crew questions if their irresponsible captain has misled them, or if he has an ingenious strategy yet to be revealed. More questions arise about what the future holds. How will Princess Azalyn cope with her 16th birthday? What hijinks will the Marines get up to next? Can Yuriko and Tylor's relationship progress? And most pressing, can the Soyokaze crew reunite in time to stop the Raalgon's terrifying new threat? This new OVA promises laughs, drama, action, and romance as it concludes the epic Tylor saga. Despite the odds, Tylor has triumphed before thanks to luck and wit. But has the easygoing captain finally met his match? Or does he have one last trick up his sleeve?",
