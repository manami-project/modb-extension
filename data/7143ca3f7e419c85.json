    "text": "Two years after Tetsuro's initial journey on the Galaxy Express 999, Earth has become a battleground in the ongoing conflict against the machine empire. Tetsuro, now older, continues to fight the Machine People as part of the human resistance. When the Galaxy Express 999 returns to Earth, Tetsuro receives a mysterious message from his former traveling companion Maetel, urging him to board the train once more. Despite the destruction of the machine homeworld Andromeda, the machine empire continues to advance across the galaxy. Joining the fight against them, Tetsuro makes his way through war-torn Megalopolis to reach the 999 before it departs. On board, he finds Maetel missing and a ghostly train appearing alongside them, while the train's final destination remains unknown. Tetsuro also encounters the black knight Faust, who confronts him about the machine empire's darkest secrets. Through this latest journey on the Galaxy Express 999, Tetsuro seeks to uncover the truth about the conflict and Maetel's role in it.",
