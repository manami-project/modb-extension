  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Lyar, Kotoko-01, and the crew of the Watcher's Nest space station after they escape from Earth using an emergency procedure called Exodus. However, instead of escaping, they become trapped near the moon, discovering that Earth has become enclosed by a mysterious time barrier. On Earth, time is chaotic with different eras of history appearing randomly across the planet. The only constants are the presence of creature called Ghouls and a young woman named Kureha Misaki, who is determined to become a soldier like her late father. As Lyar, Kotoko, and the Watcher's Nest crew try to unravel the mystery of the time barrier and the connections between Misaki and the Ghouls, they encounter different versions of Misaki from various points in her life. It appears reflections of Misaki's inner conflicts are manifesting due to the ruptures in time. Lyar and the others must find a way to understand Misaki's role in what is happening to Earth as they search for a means of escaping this warped reality and returning safely home. But the temporally disjointed Earth seems to be shifting in a new direction entirely. Will the crew be able to set things right and reach the happy ending that eludes them?",
