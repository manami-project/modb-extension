  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Allied Forces Military Academy student, Misaki Kureha, is on a mission to understand her late father's military life, but her world is turned upside down when the Earth is engulfed by a mysterious time barrier. The crew of Watchers Nest, led by Major Lyar, return to find the Earth shrouded in a green haze and time running amok, with different eras of history appearing on the planet. Misaki and the presence of a Ghoul's specular are the only constants in this warped reality.\n\nAs Misaki navigates through her changing world, Lyar and his team must unravel the mystery of the time barrier, Misaki, and the Ghouls to escape this distorted reality and find their way home. The Earth changes to various forms, with different versions of Misaki appearing before Lyar and his team, leading them to question if these reflections are caused by the conflicts within Misaki.\n\nWith the Earth's history leading in a completely different direction, Misaki, Lyar, and the crew of Watchers Nest must find a way to escape this space-time maze and find a real happy ending. Will they succeed in their mission and uncover the truth behind the time barrier and the Ghouls? Only time will tell.",
