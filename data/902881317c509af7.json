Discovered by Arikawa, a member of the defense command, Kakashi becomes the center of an unusual living arrangement with Arikawa and his stern commander, Shiro. With no memories of his past, Kakashi battles the aliens for the sake of his lost loved ones while navigating the emotional complexities of his new life. As the strain of his duty wears on him, Kakashi struggles to find a reason to continue fighting, with only a broken cellphone as a reminder of his forgotten life. Will Kakashi overcome his inner turmoil and harness his power to save the world, or will he succumb to the weight of his own doubts?",
