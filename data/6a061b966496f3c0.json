  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Shiki Ryougi awakens from a two-year coma, she finds herself with no recollection of the traffic accident that put her there, or any sense of her own existence. Her only companion in this state of amnesia and emptiness is Touko Aozaki, a mysterious wizard and owner of the studio \"Garan no Dou\". Shiki's life takes a bizarre turn when she begins to perceive dark lines around objects, a phenomenon that allows her to disassemble anything she touches. Unbeknownst to her, these are the powers of her 'Mystic Eyes of Death Perception'. As strange beings start to assault her, Shiki must learn to harness her unique abilities to defend herself and find a purpose in her hollow existence. With the help of her friend Mikiya Kokutou and Touko, Shiki embarks on a journey of self-discovery and survival in this supernatural world. (Source: Original Synopsis)",
