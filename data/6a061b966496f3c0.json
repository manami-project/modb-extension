  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After spending two years in a coma caused by a traffic accident, Shiki Ryougi awakens with no memories of her past. She feels detached from the world around her, like an empty shell of a person. Shiki is visited by Touko Aozaki, a wizard who runs a studio called \"Garan no Dou.\" Touko offers to help Shiki understand her unique ability - the \"Mystic Eyes of Death Perception,\" which allow her to see the mortality of all things. Soon after awakening, Shiki finds herself under attack by strange, enigmatic beings trying to take control of her body and soul. With her hollow sense of self, she is vulnerable to their influence. However, after being forced to confront her attackers, Shiki makes the decision to fight back of her own volition. With Touko's guidance, Shiki starts learning how to control her mystic eyes and discover her true self that had been lost since the accident. Her friend Mikiya supports her on this difficult road to recovery. Though still struggling with loneliness and fragmented memories, Shiki finds new purpose in understanding her rare gift and how to wield it responsibly.",
