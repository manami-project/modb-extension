    "text": "Mao Lan is a 17-year-old girl who has been trained in her family's secret martial arts style since childhood by her grandfather, Mao Run. Though she would prefer a normal teenage life, Mao Run has insisted that Mao Lan hone her fighting skills through competitions against thugs and wild animals. When Mao Run tricks Mao Lan into entering the high-profile martial arts tournament called Prime Mat, she is initially reluctant but soon becomes fascinated by the thrill of competition. As she battles rivals in the tournament, family secrets are revealed and Mao Lan realizes she must defeat the granddaughter of her grandfather's old friend, who had mysteriously requested the match. Facing unexpected opponents and challenges, Mao Lan draws on her lifetime of disciplined training to test her skills on the biggest stage she has seen yet. Will she emerge victorious and make her family proud? Or will the pressure be too great for this otherwise ordinary schoolgirl forced into the spotlight?",
