    "text": "Yuki Terai is a 17-year-old virtual girl created by acclaimed animator Kenichi Kutsugi. Though not real, Yuki inhabits the worlds of music, sci-fi, and everyday teenage life through state-of-the-art animation that allows unprecedented emotional expression and movement. She has become Japan's number one virtual star. In the anthology \"Secrets\", Yuki's talents are showcased across six short stories in diverse genres: In \"Fly Away Alone\", she is a sultry lounge singer; \"Dos/Chin\" finds her channeling her artistic side with her mischievous robot dog; \"A Life\" is a meditative piece where Yuki reflects on happier times; \"Comet The Thief\" casts her as a playful martial arts thief in Matrix-style action; \"The Mirror\" explores Yuki's darker side as she is followed by mysterious reflected images of herself; and in \"Lazy Gui\" she races against time to save her spaceship from self-destructing. The collection also includes Yuki's smash hit music video \"My Dearest You\" and a recreation of a dramatic World War II air attack titled \"Project BB-11\". Additional extras showcase the creative techniques used to bring this virtual starlet to life. With her emotional depth and ability to inhabit many worlds, Yuki offers an experience sure to stay with viewers long after the credits roll.",
