  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After returning from other worlds, Dan and his friends try to resume normal lives on Earth. However, Dan's Bakugan, Drago, has been infused with unstable power from the Bakugan spirit Code Eve. Whenever Drago battles, he loses control and releases a destructive Mechtogan entity that doesn't distinguish between friend or foe. Meanwhile, a sinister new enemy infiltrates Bakugan Interspace, brainwashing brawlers to build an army of engineered Chaos Bakugan. This shatters loyalties among the Battle Brawlers and their fans. Dan struggles to harness Drago's new powers to stop the Mechtogan's havoc. He must also rally the Brawlers against this insidious threat aiming to take control of the virtual world and dominate Earth. The fate of Bakugan everywhere hangs in the balance.",
