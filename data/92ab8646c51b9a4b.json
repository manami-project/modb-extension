    "text": "According to ancient lore, the consumption of mermaid flesh promises eternal life, albeit at a steep cost. For Yuta, who accidentally partook of this forbidden meal centuries ago, immortality has become a burdensome curse. Wandering through the ages, Yuta seeks a mermaid who can reverse his fate, only to stumble upon a sinister ritual involving mermaids feasting on a young girl to maintain their youth. In a twist of fate, Yuta rescues the girl, Mana, who has also consumed mermaid flesh, forever altering their destinies. Together, the unlikely duo embarks on a quest to find a cure for their shared immortality, forging a bond that transforms Yuta's once lonely existence into a journey filled with hope and camaraderie. As they traverse the land, they must confront the darker side of immortality and the elusive nature of the mermaids they seek.",
