    "text": "Aoba Shunsuke is an assertive and confident transfer student who has just arrived at the newly co-ed Sunshine Academy. Expecting an all-boys school, he is surprised to find himself surrounded by female students and teachers once again. On his excited first day, Shunsuke races to campus only to find the school empty - he had forgotten it was a holiday. As he eats his packed lunch, he meets Natsumi, a kind yet towering girl who takes an immediate liking to him. Born an exceptionally tall \"SL\" girl, Natsumi faces rejection from shallow classmates but has learned self-acceptance. Shunsuke treats her as he would anyone else, beginning a sweet friendship. However, his brash attitude frequently causes misunderstandings with peers and faculty. With Natsumi's compassion and Shunsuke's confidence, their eventful life at Sunshine Academy has just begun. This heartwarming story shares the joys and woes of their blossoming bond.",
