    "text": "Spring Water Chaos: A surprise visit from Sakura Mizukami thrusts siblings Kenji and Noe Kazama into the heart of the annual \"Spring Water Competition\" at their local shrine. The coveted prize is a rare supply of special spring water, and Sakura is determined to win it. However, the competition is far from ordinary as Sakura's rival, Takao, and fellow club members, Chitose Karasuyama and Roka Shibasaki, are also vying for the prize. As the race begins, the siblings find themselves in the midst of a fierce battle, with Noe harboring no desire to help Sakura due to her constant teasing. Based on the popular Shrine Water arc from the D-Frag! manga, this anime adaptation promises a thrilling and comedic showdown where the only thing at stake is precious spring water.",
