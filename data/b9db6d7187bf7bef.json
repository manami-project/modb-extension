    "text": "Momo Minamoto seems like an ordinary high school girl living a quiet life in the city of Sorasaki. However, unbeknownst to those around her, she leads a double life as the newest recruit of Tsukikage, a secret spy organization. Under the guidance of her mentor Yuki and alongside her talented peers, Momo undergoes intense training to hone her supernatural sensory abilities. She and her fellow spies use these special skills and spy gadgets to take on covert missions. Their goal is to take down evil organizations that threaten the safety of Sorasaki's residents. Though the dangerous world of espionage pushes her abilities to the limit, Momo finds friendship and purpose in her fellow agents. Together, these high school girls balance their everyday lives with their duties as secret protectors of their community. As Momo grows into her role as a spy, she also grows closer to her makeshift family at Tsukikage.",
