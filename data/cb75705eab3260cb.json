  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is springtime and the start of a new school year at Aokisora High School. The story follows a group of high school students - first-years Haruki Mishima and Tōre Honda, second-year Natsu Asumi, and third-years Mikado Nakajima and Masamuna Sakurakoji. Haruki and Tōre are good friends looking forward to their high school life. Haruki has had a long-time crush on classmate Miharu Mashiki, while Tōre is interested in class rep Mami Mihashi, though his feelings don't seem reciprocated. Meanwhile, Natsu has matured somewhat from his earlier rebelliousness but chooses to remain a loner. Mikado and Masamuna kindly look out for Natsu. Another central character is Nasa Sanagi, sole member of the cooking research club, who is dedicated to perfecting his craft. The nearby convenience store becomes a common hang-out spot where members of the group frequently visit after school for ice cream, magazines, ingredients, socializing over favorite snacks, and making memories. Over time, relationships and reasons for visiting the store begin to shift. While romance and school life feature prominently, the overarching story seems to be about the bonds formed through the little moments shared in the convenience store by this group of students.",
