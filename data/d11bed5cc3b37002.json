The anime, produced by Buildup Entertainment, known for Gundam: Mission To The Rise and Macross Plus, offers a unique blend of computer animation and stop-motion figumation techniques.\n\nAkiba-chan, the main character, is a posable figurine, embodying the otaku's passion for collecting anime figurines and other merchandise. Alongside her are Otome-chan, Riki-chan, Lillian-chan, and Milk-chan, each with their own quirks and charms. Together, they navigate through a myriad of peculiar situations, from concocting invisibility potions and crafting homemade chocolates to rehearsing for a school arts festival and balancing their love for games with homework.\n\nDirected by Junya Kabe (Specter, D) and with character designs by Poyoyon Rock (Nurse Witch Komugi, Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko), Akiba-chan promises a delightful and engaging journey through the everyday lives of these unique characters. Prepare for a rollercoaster of laughter, fun, and unexpected twists as Akiba-chan and her friends embark on their whimsical adventures.",
