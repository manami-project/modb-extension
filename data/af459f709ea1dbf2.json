  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In July 2008, mankind faced potential extinction when highly devastating ultra-magnetic weapons were unleashed, destroying over half the world instantly. The earth was thrown off its axis, the continents sank below the sea, and attempts to flee to space failed, with spaceships forced back to earth. One spaceship narrowly escaped and crash-landed on a small surviving island. The crew settled there, and years later a boy named Conan was born - a ray of light amidst the post-apocalyptic darkness. Conan was raised on this island, believing it was inhabited solely by his grandfather and himself. His worldview shifts when he discovers Lana washed up on shore. Conan learns that other settlements exist, like the technologically advanced Industria. However, Industria kidnaps Lana to exploit her grandfather Dr. Lao's knowledge. Determined to rescue Lana from injustice, Conan embarks on his first journey off the island, one that will ultimately impact humanity's fate.",
