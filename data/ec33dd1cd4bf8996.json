  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is the year Correct Century 2345, two thousand years after humanity's space age came to an end. On Earth, technology has regressed and the people now live simple, pre-industrial lives, having forgotten their advanced past. However, an advanced human civilization still thrives on the Moon in the cities of the Moonrace. Seeking resources, the Moonrace sends three teenagers - Loran Cehack, Keith Laijie and Fran Doll - to Earth on a reconnaissance mission to determine if the planet can once again sustain human life. Two years later, the Moonrace arrives in force with their Dianna Counter army, aiming to seize land. The people of Earth resist the invasion aggressively. As negotiations fail, conflict ignites over the Moonrace's attempted settlement. In the ensuing clashes, Loran discovers a long-buried mobile suit called the Turn A Gundam. As he pilots it, the Turn A causes a standoff between the two sides. With catastrophe looming, Loran and the people of Earth and Moon must find a way to coexist in peace, avoid all-out war, and prevent the nightmare of humanity's forgotten past from resurfacing.",
