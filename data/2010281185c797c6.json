  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The world was plunged into chaos when the Demon God Emperor Feng Xiu and his seventy-two Demon God Pillars descended from the heavens, turning all beings touched by their aura into demonic creatures. To counter this threat, humanity formed six holy temples, leading to a delicate balance between humans and demons. Long Haochen, the protagonist, joins one of the temples to become a knight, driven by the desire to save his mother. As he navigates through trials, tribulations, and encounters with destiny, he remains steadfast in his chivalrous spirit, earning recognition and forming the 'No. 1 Demon Hunters' with other talented youths. His journey is filled with love, friendship, and sacrifice, as he battles for humanity's survival and dignity. The future holds many secrets and conspiracies, and it remains uncertain whether Long Haochen can ascend to the divine throne and resolve the world's greatest crisis.",
