  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryuuji has always taken pride in the homemade bento lunches he prepares. However, when his classmate Yuusaku starts bringing elaborate, restaurant-quality bentos to school, Ryuuji feels inadequate by comparison. Consumed with beating Yuusaku at bento-making, Ryuuji desperately tries every trick imaginable - even bringing a rice cooker to school! After repeated failures, Ryuuji is ready to give up. But then his friend Taiga gives him some simple, homemade onigiri rice balls. This makes Ryuuji realize that the true spirit of bento lunches is not about taste or extravagance, but rather the feelings of care put into making them. With his passion for bento renewed, Ryuuji resolves to keep making lunches for himself and his friends, no matter what Yuusaku brings to school.",
