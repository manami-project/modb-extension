When Menou crosses paths with Akari, a charming yet enigmatic Lost One, she expects just another mission. However, Akari proves to be indestructible, turning Menou's world upside down. As Menou grapples with her duty and the mystery surrounding Akari's immortality, an unexpected bond forms between them. Together, they embark on a journey that will challenge Menou's beliefs and change her life forever.\n\nMeanwhile, Mitsuki Mutou, an ordinary Japanese student, finds himself transported to a strange world.

Offering him shelter at her church, Menou promises to help him uncover his hidden power. As they delve deeper into Mitsuki's potential, they discover that his Special Concept is far more potent and dangerous than anyone could have imagined.
