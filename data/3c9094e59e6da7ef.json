  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There was a spacecraft malfunction that led to Ryu, an Earth astronaut, and his AI robot companion, MOS, crash-landing on a self-navigating planet called Gdleen. Ryu encounters a charming Euradonian fairy, Fana, but their meeting is short-lived as they are captured by the Babaress warriors. The Babaress are at war with the Miyorl tribe over the control of the Governor's Castle, the residence of their God. Ryu and Fana are intended to be sacrificed to this God, but will they be able to escape? And what is the true identity of this deity they call the Governor?",
