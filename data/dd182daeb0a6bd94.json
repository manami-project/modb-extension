  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Arsène Lupin III is the charismatic grandson of the legendary gentleman thief Arsène Lupin. Following in his grandfather's footsteps, Lupin III leads a team of skilled thieves on elaborate heists across the globe, always staying one step ahead of the determined Inspector Zenigata of Interpol. Lupin III's partners-in-crime include Jigen, his quick-drawing gunman with expert marksmanship; Goemon, a stoic swordsman who can cut through anything; and Fujiko Mine, an untrustworthy femme fatale who uses her charms to manipulate situations to her advantage. Though Fujiko regularly double-crosses Lupin and the team, she remains a frequent collaborator and love interest for Lupin. Whether orchestrating an intricate museum theft, racing luxury sports cars, or exposing the secrets of a master illusionist, Lupin III and his gang take on every caper with a cocky, silly, and hard-boiled attitude. Though Inspector Zenigata always trails close behind, these lovable rogues charm and shoot their way out of trouble, making off with the loot to fund their lavish, thrill-seeking lifestyles. With limitless tricks up his sleeve, the world's greatest thief always escapes to steal another day.",
