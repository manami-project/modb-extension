  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After contracting hepatitis A, seventeen-year-old Ezaki Yuuichi finds himself confined to a hospital, separated from his normal teenage life. Bored and restless, he frequently sneaks out of his room, only to get caught each time by Akiko, his strict nurse. During one of these escapes, Akiko introduces Yuuichi to Akiba Rika, a beautiful but aloof teenage girl also staying at the hospital. Though initially put off by her selfishness, Yuuichi persists in befriending Rika. As they spend more time together, he sees beyond her prickly exterior while she lets her guard down. They grow closer, finding happiness in ordinary moments and experiences, even as Rika's critical heart condition casts a shadow over the new relationship. Yuuichi must reconcile his budding romance with Rika and the joys of everyday teenage life with her tragic prognosis that leaves little time ahead. Their time together is a bittersweet mix of young love and impending loss.",
