  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Together, the Matsuno sextuplets and their eccentric town residents bring a whirlwind of comedic chaos to the screen. Osomatsu, one of the sextuplets, and his brothers are nearly indistinguishable, but their wild personalities set them apart. Joining them are a host of bizarre characters, including a bucktoothed French-styled con artist named Iyami and his bald, diminutive sidekick Chibita. These two scammers are always cooking up get-rich-quick schemes, adding to the town's already topsy-turvy atmosphere. With each episode standing alone as a comedy cavalcade, this anime is a non-stop rollercoaster of absurdity and laughter that will leave you questioning logic and reason. Prepare to meet a cast of quirky locals who will keep you entertained and begging for more.",
