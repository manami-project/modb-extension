    "text": "Blessed with extraordinary abilities and intellect, the enigmatic group known as the Bresudo have been covertly manipulating human history since time immemorial. Their true intentions remain shrouded in mystery, casting an ominous shadow over the world. Most people dismiss their existence as mere speculation, but one tenacious journalist, Lucie Davenport, finds herself drawn to Texas in search of a particular family, leading her to cross paths with the cyborgs.\n\nJoe Shimamura and his fellow cyborgs, once tasked with safeguarding humanity, have been relieved of their duties following the inception of the UN Guardian troops. Now, they lead tranquil lives, far removed from their former battles. However, Lucie's arrival and the resurgence of the Bresudo threaten to disrupt their newfound peace, drawing them back into a conflict that could determine the fate of humanity.",
