    "text": "Joe Shimamura and his fellow cyborg comrades, once protectors of humanity, now live quiet civilian lives after years of struggle. However, when a shadowy group known as the Bresudo, who possess immense powers and manipulate history, resurface with mysterious goals that threaten the world, the cyborgs are drawn into the fray once more. An American journalist named Lucy Davenport travels to Texas seeking a certain family with possible ties to the elusive Bresudo. Instead, she meets Joe and the other cyborgs. Her arrival, along with the Bresudo's return, reignites the cyborgs' desire to fight to save humanity. Though the newly established UN Guardian troops now safeguard people, Joe and his comrades feel compelled to join the growing battle against the powerful Bresudo. With superhuman abilities and intellect, the Bresudo cast a dark pall over the Earth. Joe and his allies must uncover their shadowy agenda in order to defeat them and secure humanity's future. It's a new mission, but one the cyborgs readily and resolutely accept.",
