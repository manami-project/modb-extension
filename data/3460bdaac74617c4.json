  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 1977, 13-year-old Yokota Megumi was living a normal life with her loving family in Japan when she was suddenly abducted by North Korean operatives. This shocking event sparked a decades-long effort by Megumi's persistent parents to uncover the truth about their daughter's fate and prompt action from the Japanese government to bring her and other kidnapped citizens home. Though North Korea eventually acknowledged abducting Megumi and other Japanese citizens in the late 1970s, they have provided no conclusive evidence regarding her ultimate fate. This documentary anime depicts Megumi's childhood and the trauma of her abduction, then delves into her parents' tireless crusade for answers and justice in the face of governmental reluctance. Spanning over 30 years, this story intimately explores the enduring grief of a family torn apart by a callous political act. Their resilience in the fight to reunite with lost loved ones or attain closure stands as a testament to the transcendent bonds of family and humanity.",
