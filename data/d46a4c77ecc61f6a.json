    "text": "Graduate student Masanori Okamoto from Tokyo University of the Arts presents a poignant exploration of loneliness in this 2012 animation. Drawing inspiration from the rebellious haiku poet Taneda Santoka, Okamoto employs the cutout method to capture the delicate facial expressions of a solitary, slightly inebriated man journeying through the mountains. The result is a profound and intimate portrayal of isolation, beautifully encapsulated in the unique visual style of this innovative animator.",
