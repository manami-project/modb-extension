  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This poignant anime short explores the emotion of loneliness through the story of Taneda Santoka, a poet known for breaking conventions in haiku poetry. Utilizing the cutout animation method, the film subtly depicts the facial expressions of Santoka as he journeys alone through the mountains, slightly inebriated. We witness the quiet contemplation and isolation of a man traveling in solitude, symbolic of the loneliness within us all. Though few words are spoken, the stunning visuals and atmosphere move the viewer, encouraging reflection on the universal experience of loneliness. This graduate project from acclaimed Tokyo University of the Arts represents a creative vision that uses animation to examine deeper emotional truths.",
