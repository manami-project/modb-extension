  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime centers around a city facing economic decline and the different generations living in it. The adults have lost hope, succumbing to a bleak outlook on the future. In contrast, the youth have normalized the poverty and troubles around them, accepting it as an ordinary part of life. However, the complacency of the youngsters gets disrupted when a disruptive force named Haruko enters the picture. Haruko's chaotic presence throws the city into upheaval. After these events involving Haruko, the story later shifts to focus on three teenagers who have graduated and started working adult jobs. With a theme examining the feeling of being an adult, this sequel anime utilizes computer generated imagery animation to depict the characters' experiences entering the workforce in the same declining city from the prequel. Spanning different time periods, this franchise explores how different generations living in hardship react to their plight, with the introduction of an unpredictable variable leading to turmoil and change.",
