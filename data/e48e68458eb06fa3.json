    "text": "On a typical day, Koguma, a high school student in Yamanashi, finds herself in a vehicle shop, yearning for a change in her monotonous life. With no parents, friends, or hobbies to fill her days, she sees a glimmer of hope in a pre-owned Honda Super Cub motorcycle. With the motorcycle now hers, Koguma embarks on daily adventures, turning routine trips to school into thrilling journeys filled with detours and gas stopovers. As she navigates her newfound freedom on the open road, Koguma crosses paths with her classmate, Reiko, who shares her enthusiasm for motorcycles. Together, they forge a friendship that transforms Koguma's once lonely world into one brimming with excitement and camaraderie.",
