    "text": "Usui Kenta, a new transfer student, is about to uncover the unusual secret of his classmate, Karin Maaka, who hails from a family of vampires residing in Japan. Unlike her bloodsucking kin, Karin grapples with an extraordinary condition that leads her body to overproduce blood, compelling her to bestow her excess blood upon unsuspecting victims. This peculiar affliction results in her 'victims' experiencing an unexpected boost in their vitality and happiness.\n\nKarin's life takes a complicated turn when she encounters Kenta, as her blood seems to react inexplicably to his presence, generating even more blood than usual. Along with her siblings, Anju and Ren, Karin strives to keep her unique condition under wraps while navigating the challenges of school life. However, maintaining her secret becomes increasingly difficult as Kenta grows more suspicious of her strange behavior.\n\nPrepare for a delightful and comedic twist on the classic vampire tale, as Karin walks the fine line between safeguarding her secret and managing her eccentric blood-making condition. Will she succeed in concealing her true nature from Kenta, or will her excessive nosebleeds give her away?",
