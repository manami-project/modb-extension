    "text": "The Seigaku tennis team is invited on an all-expenses-paid luxury cruise, but soon realizes things are not what they seem. They discover the cruise is hosting illegal gambling on exhibition matches between Seigaku and a team led by Ryoma's supposed long-lost brother Ryoga. The twisted owner Sakurafubuki threatens Seigaku to intentionally lose or else. Trapped at sea with danger lurking, Seigaku must try to outwit their captors. Tensions run high as Ryoma faces off against Ryoga in a brother vs brother showdown. Will Seigaku defeat the conspiracy and escape to safety? Or will they be forced to lose for profit and pay a heavier price?",
