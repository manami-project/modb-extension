    "text": "Tarou Kawaguchi's grieving nephew, Moritaka Mashiro, once harbored dreams of becoming a mangaka, but now finds himself directionless in his final year of middle school. When his classmate and academic prodigy, Akito Takagi, discovers Mashiro's artistic prowess and unrequited affection for Azuki Miho, he persuades him to join forces and create manga together. The duo aspires to reach great heights in the manga world, but Mashiro has an additional motivation: to marry Azuki, who aspires to be a voice actress. In a spontaneous moment, he proposes to her, and she agrees, but only after they both achieve their dreams. With this promise in mind, Mashiro and Takagi embark on a challenging journey to become the greatest mangaka in Japan.",
