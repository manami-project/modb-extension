    "text": "Moritaka Mashiro is a talented artist who lacks direction and motivation, coasting through his middle school days without dreams or plans for the future. His classmate Akito Takagi, an aspiring writer and top student, discovers Mashiro's artistic abilities and recognizes his potential. Takagi convinces Mashiro to collaborate with him to become manga artists. Though initially reluctant, Mashiro is inspired when he learns that his crush, Azuki Miho, dreams of being a voice actress. He boldly proposes to Azuki, promising that when their manga is adapted into an anime, she can play the lead female role. She agrees, but only once they have both achieved their dreams. Now fired up to make manga, Mashiro and Takagi form the pen name Ashirogi Muto. Together they work to hone their craft, hoping to create a popular series that will launch their careers as well as bring Mashiro one step closer to marrying Azuki. Along the way they discover the challenges of the manga industry while holding fast to their ultimate goal - to become the most successful manga artists Japan has ever seen.",
