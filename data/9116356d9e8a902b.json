  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hozuki is the unflappable and ruthless aide to the bumbling Great King Enma, ruler of Hell. As Enma's right-hand demon, Hozuki tirelessly deals with the endless problems that arise in running the underworld - from quelling riots to wrangling unruly folklore creatures. Though highly competent at his job, even Hozuki needs some downtime, which he spends on more lighthearted hobbies like fawning over cute animals. In the second season, Hozuki and his eccentric demon colleagues continue keeping Hell in order through their usual mix of ingenious torture methods and bureaucratic wizardry. Whether renovating their queen's palace with damned souls or managing a publicity stunt with idol musicians, life in Hell is always unpredictable. As Hozuki's mysterious backstory is slowly revealed, both familiar and new faces from Japanese mythology join the infernal fun.",
