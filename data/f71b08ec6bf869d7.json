  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Anatoray and Disith, two nations locked in a relentless war, inhabit the world of Prester, where flight is the primary means of transportation. The skies are governed by the enigmatic Guild, who control the Claudia Fluid, a liquidized form of crystals that power the engines of the airships. Amidst this chaos, young Claus Valca and his spirited navigator, Lavie Head, aspire to follow in their parents' footsteps and become renowned Sky Couriers. Piloting a small, two-person vanship, they traverse the perilous Grand Stream, a treacherous air current separating the warring nations.\n\nWhen Claus and Lavie accept a seemingly ordinary mission to transport an orphan girl, Alvis Hamilton, to the battleship Silvana, their lives take a dramatic turn. They find themselves entangled in a much larger conflict, one that pits them against the formidable Guild. As they navigate the complexities of this new reality, Claus and Lavie strive to bring peace to their world while unraveling the mysteries that lie at its core. Their journey will test their courage, challenge their friendship, and ultimately determine their destiny.",
