  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works TV anime, based on the popular visual novel game, will be releasing a 10-minute bonus short on its second Blu-ray box set. This short will bring to life the \"sunny day\" scenario - an alternate positive ending to the Unlimited Blade Works storyline where the protagonist finds happiness. Originally part of the source material, this alternate ending provides fans a rare glimpse at what could have been for the characters. Now animated for the first time, the short promises a lighter, more uplifting take after the intensity of the main series. With its roots in the game that started it all, the OVA should appeal greatly to longtime fans while potentially attracting new viewers with its optimism. Those looking for closure may find it here in this surprise adaptation that brings another piece of the Fate world to the screen.",
