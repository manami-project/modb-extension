  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Running at the forefront of the new 'Chitose' episode is the introduction of a celestial character, Lierre, who leads Pekora and the other angels. Lierre takes on the guise of a young girl as she descends to Earth to fulfill a mysterious mission.\n\nIn the midst of their usual antics, the devils catch a glimpse of an enticing advertisement for Chitose, Hokkaido, prompting Yurine Hanazono to propose a group trip. Despite Jashin-chan's reluctance, she is coerced into joining the excursion under the looming threat of Yurine's chainsaw. As the day of sightseeing draws to a close, Jashin-chan's carelessness results in a stray deer consuming their hotel check-in ticket. In a twist of fate, the fallen angels are also vacationing in Hokkaido and are staying at the same hotel. With no other option, Jashin-chan is forced to engage in a high-stakes race around Lake Shikotsu to secure the angels' ticket.\n\nThe episode's production is made possible through Chitose's hometown tax program, which allows urban taxpayers to contribute to rural taxes in exchange for tax breaks and other incentives. The narrative delves into the workings and benefits of this unique tax system.",
