  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The new episode of this comedy anime focuses on the characters taking a trip to Chitose, Hokkaido. The story kicks off when the devils see a TV ad for Chitose and decide to visit. Even the reluctant Jashin-chan is forced to join them. When they arrive, Jashin-chan accidentally loses their hotel ticket. As luck would have it, their angel rivals happen to be staying at the same hotel. A zany competition ensues with Jashin battling the angels in a race around Lake Shikotsu, vying for the extra hotel ticket. Interspersed is the theme of Chitose's Hometown Tax Donation program. This allows urban taxpayers to donate part of their taxes to rural areas in exchange for income tax credits. The anime was even funded through this program, with taxpayers contributing money specifically for this Chitose-focused episode. Overall, viewers can expect a fast-paced story filled with the characters' antics in Hokkaido, centered around a civic program aimed at supporting rural communities.",
