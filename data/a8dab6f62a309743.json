  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There's a new twist in the world of literature and reincarnation with the story of Harumi Kazuhito, a high school bookworm who meets an untimely end while protecting his favorite author, Natsuno Kirihime, from a robber. In a bizarre turn of events, Kazuhito is reborn as a dachshund dog, only to find himself adopted by the same author he once admired. But his new life is far from the quiet, book-filled existence he once enjoyed. Instead, he must navigate the eccentricities of his new owner, a sadistic woman with a penchant for wielding scissors. As he struggles to adapt to his bookless life and the unpredictable behavior of his new owner, Kazuhito embarks on a comedic and mysterious journey filled with unexpected twists and turns. Will he find a way to coexist with his tormentor, or will her scissor-happy antics prove to be his ultimate undoing? Only time will tell in this absurd, comedy-filled tale of reincarnation, literature, and one very unlucky dachshund.",
