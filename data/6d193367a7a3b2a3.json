    "text": "Conan Doyle's notorious villain, William James Moriarty, takes center stage in this crime-suspense anime set in the late 19th century. As an adopted orphan into the affluent Moriarty family, Moriarty witnesses firsthand the harsh class divide in England, where the aristocracy thrives at the expense of the working class. Determined to upend this unjust system, Moriarty assumes the role of a \"crime consultant,\" cunningly orchestrating perfect crimes to bring justice to the downtrodden. As the genius mind behind a series of strategic criminal acts, Moriarty vows to revolutionize the nation, even if it means clashing with the brilliant detective Sherlock Holmes. Will Moriarty's criminal mastery prove enough to dismantle the oppressive regime and create a more equitable society? Join him and his brothers on this thrilling journey as they challenge the status quo and reshape their world.",
