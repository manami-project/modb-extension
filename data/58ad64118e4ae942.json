    "text": "So long as human hearts are burdened with stress and emotions, peculiar spirits can invade, leading to the manifestation of enigmatic physical symptoms known as 'mysterious diseases'. These ailments, unseen and untreated by conventional medicine, require the intervention of a unique doctor named Ramune. With an eccentric demeanor that may initially seem unprofessional, Ramune possesses an extraordinary ability to delve deep into the hearts of his patients, identifying the roots of their bizarre conditions. From a girl who sheds condiments instead of tears to a boy whose fingers have morphed into chili peppers, Ramune takes on the most peculiar cases. However, the cure for these mysterious diseases comes at a cost, one that cannot be settled with mere money. As he navigates through these unusual ailments, Ramune, the mysterious disease specialist, offers hope to those plagued by these inexplicable conditions.",
