  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tomoya Aki is a high school student and aspiring game developer who starts his own doujin circle called Blessing Software with some eccentric creators from his school. The group includes illustrator Eriri Spencer Sawamura, model Megumi Kato, scriptwriter Utaha Kasumigaoka, and music producer Michiru Hyoudou, who is Tomoya's cousin. After six months of hard work, Blessing Software nears completion of their first video game but needs some scenic background photos to finish. They decide to take a trip to a hot springs inn near a mountain forest to take pictures and make use of the outdoor bath. However, Tomoya finds his attention torn between focusing on their project and fending off the advances of his friends. Michiru playfully flirts with him while Utaha obsessively tries to act out romantic scenarios. Meanwhile, aloof Megumi and childhood friend Eriri busy themselves with their work. Navigating the affections of these four girls proves challenging for Tomoya but is necessary for the game's completion.",
