    "text": "Sibyl System, the backbone of Japan's future, faces an unprecedented threat in January 2118. The Peacebreakers, a rogue paramilitary group previously disbanded by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, have re-emerged, targeting the highly classified 'Stronskaya Document'. This document, the brainchild of Professor Milicia Stronskaya, holds the potential to disrupt Japan's government and the Sibyl System itself.\n\nChief Inspector Akane Tsunemori of the Criminal Investigation Department is thrust into the heart of the crisis when Stronskaya's body is discovered on a foreign vessel. Reuniting with Kougami Shin'ya, a former Enforcer turned mercenary now working under Frederica Hanashiro's command at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Tsunemori must navigate escalating tensions and the resurgence of old grudges.\n\nAs the Peacebreakers evade capture, thanks to an allegedly manipulated colleague, Tsunemori realizes the gravity of the situation. The Stronskaya Document remains unfound, sparking a high-stakes race against time. With the potential to upend Japan's very foundation, the document's contents could redefine the nation's future. Tsunemori and her team must set aside their differences and work together to safeguard the Sibyl System and uncover the truth hidden within the Stronskaya Document.",
