    "text": "In the war-torn medieval Kingdom of Midland, a lone mercenary named Guts wanders the countryside, selling his martial skills to whoever will pay. Preferring solitude and self-reliance, he shuns camaraderie and higher causes. When Guts bests the forces of a local nobleman, he catches the attention of Griffith, charismatic leader of the Band of the Hawk mercenaries. Sensing Guts' potential, Griffith challenges and defeats the rugged swordsman, forcing him into the Band's ranks. As Guts fights alongside Griffith, the two develop a close bond. But the mysterious Griffith harbors an all-consuming dream to rule a kingdom of his own making. To realize this dream, he leverages the Band of the Hawk's battlefield victories to gain noble titles and lands. Guts questions whether Griffith values their friendship or merely sees him as a means to an end. Casca, the Band's sole female warrior, also wrestles with her view of the stoic Guts and her loyalty to Griffith. Where do Guts' and Griffith's destinies lie? And how far will Griffith go to achieve his dream kingdom, for good or ill?",
