  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Desiring nothing more than the thrill of combat, Guts, a formidable mercenary, roams the war-torn lands of Midland with his colossal sword. His exceptional skills catch the eye of Griffith, the enigmatic commander of the mercenary faction, Band of the Hawk. Following a duel that leaves Guts defeated, he reluctantly joins the group, and together they strive to aid Midland against the Chuder Empire.\n\nAs the bond between Guts and Griffith strengthens, so does the influence of the Band of the Hawk, which is eventually recognized as a legitimate military force. However, not everyone in the group is welcoming of Guts, especially Casca, the solitary swordswoman.\n\nWhile Griffith's ambitions extend far beyond the ongoing war, Guts starts to question his allegiance and the true purpose behind his relentless battles. Unbeknownst to them, their intertwined fates are set to take a dark and monstrous turn, one that will put their loyalty to the ultimate test.",
