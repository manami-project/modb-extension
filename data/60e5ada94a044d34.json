  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Just over a decade ago, the formidable Holy Britannian Empire launched a devastating invasion on Japan, swiftly conquering the nation with their advanced mecha technology, the Knightmare Frames. Renamed Area 11, Japan is now a mere shadow of its former self, its citizens stripped of their rights and freedom, and forced to live under the oppressive rule of their conquerors. However, the spirit of rebellion remains alive, with resistance groups fighting to reclaim their homeland.\n\nCaught in the crossfire of this ongoing conflict is Lelouch Lamperouge, an exiled Britannian prince disguised as a student in Area 11. His life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a mysterious girl named C.C., who bestows upon him the Geass, a powerful ability that grants him absolute control over anyone's actions.\n\nWith this newfound power, Lelouch embarks on a perilous journey as the masked vigilante Zero, determined to bring down the Britannian Empire and exact revenge for the injustices inflicted upon Japan. As he navigates the treacherous path of rebellion, Lelouch must confront his own desires and decide whether his quest for vengeance will lead to freedom or plunge him into darkness.",
