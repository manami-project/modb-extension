  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over a century ago, the moon was destroyed, creating debris that threatens the Earth. Now, a secret agency called the Mondenkind Agency protects the planet using giant piloted robots called iDOLs. 16-year-old Haruka Amami auditions to be a pop idol, but is instead recruited by Mondenkind to be an iDOLmaster - one of the few pilots capable of synchronizing with an iDOL. Haruka is assigned to the iDOL Imber, though she struggles to connect with its alien heart. Haruka moves to Tokyo and joins other girls training to be iDOLmasters. However, they soon face attacks from Turiavita, another organization with its own iDOL trying to capture Imber. Despite self doubts, Haruka resolves to understand Imber in order to protect the Earth with her fellow iDOLmasters.",
