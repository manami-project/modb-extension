  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Still in debt to the ruthless loan shark Million Dollar, the morally dubious sorcerer Chivas Scotch accepts a lucrative task from Count Cuttlefish. The assignment: to exterminate a monstrous threat plaguing the nearby village of Gesoura. Joined by his eclectic entourage—the enchanting Sister of the Golden Cross, Gin Fizz; the fierce young warrior, Genmi; and the adorable werewolf elf, Kiss—Chivas embarks on this perilous journey.\n\nHowever, when Chivas' attempt to vanquish the creature fails, he resorts to a desperate measure: transferring his spirit into Gin's body. Now sharing a physical form with the woman he once treated as a mere servant, Chivas Scotch must navigate through this unexpected twist of fate while still attempting to rid the land of the malevolent force. All the while, the shadow of an even greater evil looms, as a sinister plot to resurrect an ancient god of darkness begins to unfold. Will Chivas rise to the challenge, or succumb to the wickedness that surrounds him?",
