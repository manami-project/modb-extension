    "text": "When Saku Fukuzawa, a typical working woman, decides to adopt a stray black cat named Yukichi, she finds herself living with more than just a pet. Yukichi, a colossal feline, is far from ordinary, standing taller than Saku herself. This extraordinary cat is a whiz in the kitchen, always on the lookout for the best bargains at the supermarket, and takes pride in maintaining a clean and tidy home. As Saku navigates her busy life, Yukichi becomes her unexpected support system, making it difficult to determine who is truly caring for whom. Every evening, the gentle giant of a cat eagerly awaits Saku's return, turning their ordinary life into an extraordinary tale of companionship.",
