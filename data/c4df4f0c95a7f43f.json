  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akira Miyazaki, the renowned screenwriter of the classic WMT series, brings to life the timeless tale of Aladdin in this animated film. Known for his meticulous attention to detail, Miyazaki stays true to the original story, with the exception of a quirky kangaroo-rat that makes an unexpected appearance and becomes Aladdin's loyal, albeit purposeless, companion.\n\nIn this captivating narrative, Aladdin is lured into a magical cave by an evil sorcerer, who seeks a mysterious oil lamp hidden within. However, when Aladdin uncovers the sorcerer's malicious intentions, he decides to keep the lamp for himself. Little does he know, the lamp houses a benevolent spirit bound to grant the wishes of its owner.\n\nWith the spirit's help, Aladdin's life takes a dramatic turn. He transforms from a humble boy into the talk of the town, capturing the heart of the beautiful Princess Madral and gaining wealth and influence. Despite some confusing plot jumps during Aladdin's pursuit of the princess, the film remains an engaging watch, thanks to Miyazaki's faithful adaptation.\n\nAccompanied by a musical score from Yukihide Takekawa, known for his work on the Unico pilot film, this anime presents slightly more westernized character designs than typical for the genre. Despite the absence of Toei's extravagant animation prevalent in the 60s, this film stands out as an above-average adaptation of the classic Aladdin tale.",
