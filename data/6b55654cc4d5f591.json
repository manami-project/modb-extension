  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Offers of stardom, rivalries, and the struggle for acceptance define the journey of To-Y, the charismatic frontman of the indie punk rock band GASP. As they prepare for their mainstream debut at the Yaon Hibiya auditorium, the band's bad-boy reputation and unique style make them a target for the machinations of the music industry. Aikawa Yoji, a popular singer and GASP's rival, along with his manager Ms. Kato, attempt to sabotage the band's success by offering To-Y a lucrative solo career.\n\nCaught between loyalty to his bandmates and the allure of fame, To-Y must navigate a world that seeks to exploit his talent and suppress GASP's unconventional image. Meanwhile, the enigmatic Niya, a cat-like character who claims to be To-Y's \"aijin,\" and Koishikawa Hiderou, a fan with a personal interest in To-Y, add layers of intrigue to the story.\n\nAs GASP's concert date looms, the band must confront the industry's attempts to mold them into something they're not. Will they remain true to their roots and defy expectations, or will they succumb to the pressures of commercial success? Join To-Y and GASP as they fight for their place in the music world and challenge the norms of what it means to be accepted.",
