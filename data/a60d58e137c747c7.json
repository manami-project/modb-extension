  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in an alternative 2031, a mysterious \"Quantum Reactor\" energy device unexpectedly explodes, triggering an event known as the \"Xianglong Crisis\" that radically alters the global environment. As a result, machines and organisms rapidly evolve, with the dangerous B.R.A.I. entities in particular rising to threaten humanity's survival. Seven years later, Leon Lau lives in seclusion with Chloe Lau, having witnessed the crisis firsthand. United by a special pact, they conduct research to counter the B.R.A.I., though their daily routine seems an escape from the looming danger. Still, with humanity driven to the brink, the threat persists as strange new technologies and lifeforms wrestle for supremacy in this starkly transformed world. Despite the crisis, Leon and Chloe's bond perseveres, representing one last hope as civilizations scramble to adapt to the new order. Yet shadowy forces continue to endanger the future, locked in an existential war where the very distinction between human and machine blurs. In this scarcely recognizable world, Leon and Chloe may provide a critical key to shielding humanity's last vestiges from extinction.",
