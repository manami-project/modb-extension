    "text": "For years, Guts, the formidable captain of the Band of the Hawk's raiders, has been a key player in the band's relentless victories, slicing through hordes of enemies with his colossal sword. Under the charismatic leadership of Griffith, the band's reputation in the kingdom of Midland has only grown. Their latest mission, however, is a daunting one: to seize the seemingly invincible Fortress of Doldrey, a task that has thwarted all previous attempts. As the Band of the Hawk braces for a grueling battle against an army of 30,000 soldiers from the Empire of Chuder, Guts grapples with a personal realization. In order to stand as Griffith's equal and be truly considered his friend, he must depart from the Band of the Hawk. Despite Griffith's desperate attempts to retain him, Guts bids farewell to his comrades, setting off a chain of events that will irrevocably alter the destiny of Griffith and the Band of the Hawk.",
