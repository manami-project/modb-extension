    "text": "Fist of the North Star's action-packed prequel introduces us to the enigmatic figure known as the 'King of Death,' or Yan Wang, who prowls the treacherous streets of pre-war Shanghai. In the politically fragmented Shanghai of the 1930s, foreign governments and Chinese factions have carved the city into distinct quarters, each governed by its own laws and rife with corruption. As major powers engage in political power struggles, local gangs rule the streets, making life cheap and death omnipresent.\n\nYan Wang, a master of the lethal martial art Hokuto Shinken, once fought against the evil forces plaguing the city. After vanquishing the worst gangsters, he disappeared, leaving only rumors of his return to Japan. In reality, he is Kasumi Kenshiro, a Tokyo professor and the 62nd successor of the deadly assassin art. When he learns that his old Qing Bang Triad friend, Pan Guang-Lin, and his love interest, Pan Yu-Ling, are in danger, he leaves his teaching job and journeys to Shanghai.\n\nIn Shanghai, Kasumi encounters and battles the three families of Hokuto: Hokuto Sonkaken, Hokuto Soukaken, and Hokuto Ryuukaken. Amidst these battles, he leads a rebellion against the corrupt Hong Hua Triads to restore honor and power to the Qing Bang. As various individuals seek him out, the question remains: who will find the King of Death first?",
