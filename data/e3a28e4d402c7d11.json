As he continues to implement administrative reforms to revitalize his kingdom, Kazuya must now confront an envoy from the Gran Chaos Empire, who seeks to punish him for violating the Mankind Declaration Treaty's ban on war. Despite the looming threat, Kazuya devises a plan to avoid conflict and gain new allies, but first, he must convince the envoy to approve his strategy.\n\nSummoned to a fantasy world, Kazuya Souma has been ruling the Elfrieden Kingdom with a unique approach to administrative reform. He's tackled food shortages, mastered dark magic, and won the hearts of a few ladies. However, his recent actions have led him to break the ban on war to overthrow a military dictatorship. Now, he must face the consequences and answer to the Gran Chaos Empire's idealistic leader.\n\nAfter being crowned King of Elfrieden, Kazuya Souma has been successfully managing his kingdom through administrative reforms. He's overcome food shortages, dealt with troublemakers, and even mastered dark magic. But when he decides to break the peace to eliminate a military dictatorship, he finds himself in hot water with the Gran Chaos Empire and its idealistic leader, which could have serious implications for him and his kingdom.\n\nWith the conquest of the Principality of Amidonia complete, Souma, the provisional king, initiates the post-war cleanup process and his next project, Lorelei.
