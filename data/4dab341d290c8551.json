  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keigo Sayama is a lonely and pessimistic high school student who wears a face mask to school every day after a traumatic experience in middle school where he hurt a classmate with his words. The popular and outgoing Tsuzuru Saikawa becomes intrigued by the mysterious masked student and impulsively rips Sayama's mask off one day. Though initially outraged, Sayama soon captures Saikawa's interest. When Sayama is in danger of failing his exams, Saikawa offers to tutor him, but only if he can freely explore Sayama's bare face and mouth underneath his mask during their study sessions. Sayama hates having his face and lips touched, but can't resist the attention from Saikawa. As Saikawa takes increasing liberties under the mask, the two boys form an unusual bond and relationship. Their dynamic mixes tension, awkwardness, and growing attraction. This manga explores complex characters - one hiding himself from the world, the other fascinated by what's underneath. As social outcast Sayama and popular boy Saikawa come together, they must reconcile their differences, traumatic pasts, and societal roles. Their unorthodox relationship develops new dimensions to both characters.",
