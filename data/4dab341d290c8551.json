  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sayama, a perpetually pessimistic student, is known for his unusual habit of wearing a face mask to school. When the charismatic and popular Saikawa, driven by curiosity, forcefully removes Sayama's mask, an unexpected dynamic unfolds. Despite Sayama's harsh reaction and his aversion to having his bare face, lips, and mouth touched, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to Saikawa's attention.\n\nSaikawa, intrigued by the mystery shrouding Sayama, proposes an unconventional deal: he will tutor Sayama for his exams, but in return, he demands the freedom to explore what lies beneath Sayama's mask. As they navigate this peculiar arrangement, a unique relationship blossoms between them, filled with tension and an undeniable magnetic pull. Will Sayama be able to keep his emotional walls up, or will Saikawa's persistence break through his defenses? This anime promises an engaging exploration of their complex relationship.",
