    "text": "Can the Earth remain safe from the clutches of extraterrestrial evil? The Autobots, now known as Pretenders, have stayed behind to ensure just that. Led by Metalhawk, disguised as a human named Hawk, they live amongst humanity, using their unique Pretender shells to blend in seamlessly. However, their fears become reality as the Decepticons, also Pretenders, make their way back to Earth under the command of a sinister entity called Devil Z.\n\nWith both factions now on Earth, a race to gather allies and strengthen their forces begins. Humans are recruited and transformed into Junior Headmasters and Godmasters, also known as Powermasters, to aid in the impending conflict. As the battle lines are drawn, an unsuspecting truck driver finds himself in possession of two mysterious bracelets that he cannot remove. Little does he know, these bracelets will transform him into a Powermaster, turning his truck into a formidable Transformer.\n\nWith the Decepticons' goal of destroying humanity looming, the Autobot Pretenders must rise to the challenge and protect their adopted home. The fate of the Earth now lies in the balance as this new conflict unfolds.",
