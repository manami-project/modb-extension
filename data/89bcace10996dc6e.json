  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keisei's tragic demise at the hands of the Shichisei, an elite group of Shikabane driven by more than mere regrets, sets the stage for a new chapter in Kagami Ouri's life. In a bid to honor his friend's last wish, Ouri enters into a temporary contract with Makina, a Shikabane Hime, to prevent her from descending into a Shikabane. Six months later, Ouri is in training to become a full-fledged monk, aiming to stand by Makina in her battle against the Shichisei, the ruthless killers of Makina, the Hoshimura family, and now, Keisei. However, a traitorous monk named Shishidou Akasha aligns himself with the Shichisei, plotting to annihilate all Shikabane Hime and the monk organization that employs them, the Kougon Sect. Meanwhile, Makina grapples with accepting Ouri as her new partner, as she clings to the memory of her former priest, Keisei. Will Makina overcome her grief and allow Ouri to fight alongside her, or will her thirst for vengeance consume her as she hunts down the rogue Corpses responsible for Keisei's death?",
