  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shikabane Hime Aka continues the story six months after the death of Tagami Keisei at the hands of the elite Shikabane group known as the Seven Stars. Keisei's dying wish was for Kagami Ouri to form a contract with the Shikabane Hime Makina, saving her from degeneration. Since then, Ouri has been training to become a proper monk so he can remain Makina's contracted priest and support her fight against the Seven Stars - the ones responsible for originally killing Makina and her family. However, the traitorous monk Shishidou Akasha has sided with the Seven Stars with the goal of destroying all Shikabane Hime and the monk organization that utilizes them, known as the Kougon Sect. Makina also grieves the loss of Keisei, her former priest, questioning if Ouri has the necessary skills. She clings to memories of Keisei, risking destruction and losing sight of the rogue Shikabane that must be hunted. As Makina weighs accepting Ouri as her new priest to fight alongside, or pursuing revenge alone, the story continues with higher stakes and a new priest-Shikabane Hime partnership at its core. Will Makina let go of her painful past to work with Ouri against their shared enemy? Or will her thirst for vengeance overpower her?",
