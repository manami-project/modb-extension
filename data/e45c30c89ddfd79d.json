When his classmate Ozawa Haruka asks for help investigating paranormal disturbances affecting their friends, Yakumo agrees. Together, they discover their friends are being targeted by vengeful spirits and a mysterious killer. Yakumo's special ability to speak with the dead provides clues to help unravel the dark events haunting the students. However, the sinister forces at work prove persistent and deadly. As the body count rises, Yakumo and Haruka race to uncover the truth behind the attacks before the killer claims more victims. To solve the case, they must delve into buried secrets and take great risks. Their paranormal detective work leads them into grave danger, but stopping the evil plaguing the students is worth the price they may pay.",
