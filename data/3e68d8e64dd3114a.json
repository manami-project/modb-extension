  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The remnants of civilization lie in ruins, thirty years after a catastrophic war and the collapse of the Space Colonization Program. Amidst the desolation, a once-thriving planetarium stands abandoned, its lone inhabitant, Hoshino Yumemi, a companion robot, yearning to share the beauty of the cosmos with someone. After three decades of solitude, a Junker, a scavenger of relics from the destroyed cities, inadvertently stumbles upon the dilapidated structure. Unfamiliar with the concept of a planetarium, he is taken aback when Yumemi, overjoyed to have a visitor, eagerly attempts to present a celestial show. However, the projector lies broken, and the Junker, moved by the robot's unwavering dedication, finds himself agreeing to repair it, potentially restoring the sparkle in Yumemi's eyes and the stars above.",
