  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2039, rising sea levels and territorial losses spur the mysterious appearance of a fleet of fog-shrouded warships called the Fleet of Mist. This formidable enemy blockade's humanity's trade routes and decimates their forces, gradually gaining the upper hand. Seven years later, a submarine from the Fleet named I-401 and its humanoid captain approach cadet Gunzou Chihaya offering an alliance. As former enemies now united against the Fleet of Mist, Chihaya captains the I-401 submarine with its unique crew to undertake critical missions for humanity's survival. They strive to deliver a powerful new weapon to the United States through hostile territory, hoping it holds the key to finally stopping the dominant Fleet. This compilation movie recap's last year's television series with 40 minutes of new footage, further chronicling Gunzou and his crew's dangerous missions while adhering to their ideals of achieving peace. Though facing imposing challenges, this unlikely team may represent humanity's last hope against the Fleet of Mist.",
