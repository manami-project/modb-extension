    "text": "A mysterious death at Hanshui Temple sets off a chain of events in the martial world. When a valuable golden coffin goes missing, various factions vie for control over it, unaware of its true significance. Into this turmoil step Xiao Se, a bored innkeeper harboring an unknown past; Lei Wujie, a naive yet earnest martial arts student; and Tang Lian, tasked with safely transporting the coffin. After tangling with some unsavory characters, the trio teams up to continue the journey. Along the way, they bond through lighthearted antics and perilous fights. Yet the coffin's contents remain obscured, promising to alter their paths radically once revealed. As political powers wrestle for supremacy, these plucky youths may prove pivotal in determining the kingdom's fate. Though they now wander the rivers and lakes freely, greater adventures await that will test their martial skill and loyalty.",
