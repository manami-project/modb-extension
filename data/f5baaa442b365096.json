    "text": "Sakamichi Onoda is an otaku with a passion for anime who rides his beloved mamachari bike with exceptional skill. When the anime club at his school disbands, he sets out to find new members to revive it. However, his riding talents catch the attention of members of the bicycle racing club, who see his potential and try to recruit him to their team instead. As Onoda becomes immersed in the world of competitive cycling, the story follows his growth both as a rider and a person. Training runs test the team's perseverance, such as an arduous climb up the slopes of Minegayama. Along the way, bonds within the cycling club deepen, including between Onoda and his senior teammate Makishima, as Onoda shares his enthusiasm for anime merchandise. With dedication and teamwork, Onoda inches closer to becoming a racing champion while still holding onto his otaku interests. This heartwarming anime promises personal growth through athletic achievement, as well as a compassionate exploration of what it means to follow one's passions.",
