    "text": "Sengoku Basara: Judge End, inspired by Capcom's 2010 game Sengoku Basara 3 (Sengoku Basara: Samurai Heroes), transports viewers to the chaotic era of warring states in Japan. The anime centers around the monumental Battle of Sekigahara, a conflict that emerged after the downfall of Hideyoshi, who had previously led a ruthless crusade to eliminate the remaining warlords following Nobunaga's defeat. Betrayed by the ambitious Tokugawa Ieyasu, Hideyoshi's loyal followers seek vengeance, while other feudal lords rally their forces for the impending clash. With an array of mechanized samurai, mystical ninja, and gun-wielding warriors, the anime promises a thrilling, action-packed experience filled with deadly special moves and high-stakes alliances.",
