However, their peaceful life is disrupted when French secret agents, tasked with protecting nuclear interests in the region, develop a keen interest in the prehistoric creature. As the threat of nuclear testing looms, Yusuke and his father must protect Coo from being captured, sparking an unexpected chain of events.
