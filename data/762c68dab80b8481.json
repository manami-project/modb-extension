    "text": "Cyberdoll s and broken dreams intertwine in this unique tale of aspiration and second chances. Hideo Ozu, a disillusioned editor in a questionable adult film company, harbors a lifelong ambition to become a renowned movie director. His childhood friend, Mai Kurosawa, an up-and-coming actress, shatters his dreams by taking all his amateur footage of her and severing ties with him.\n\nDrowning his sorrows in alcohol, Hideo encounters a Cyberdoll named Sara, who inexplicably has him sign an invoice. Upon returning home, he finds three Cyberdolls—Mai, Ai, and Mie—each resembling different age variations of his estranged friend, Mai Kurosawa.\n\nWhen Kurosawa announces the release of a biographical video using Hideo's old footage, he seizes the opportunity to rekindle his directorial dreams. With the help of his newfound Cyberdoll companions, Hideo embarks on a journey to create his cinematic masterpiece and reclaim his lost ambition.",
