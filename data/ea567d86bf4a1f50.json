    "text": "Sora and Kyoshiro's tale unfolds in the bustling city of Academia, a beacon of hope and recovery for humanity after a devastating disaster struck a decade ago. At the heart of the story is Kuu Shiratori, an ordinary high school girl who finds solace in her mundane school life but secretly yearns for something more. Plagued by recurring dreams of a mysterious prince, her world turns upside down when the very same prince, Kyoshiro Ayanokoji, appears before her during the school festival preparations.\n\nAs the city grapples with a series of unexplained disappearances, a new transfer student named Kyoshiro joins Kuu's class, further complicating her life. She is drawn into a conflict with the enigmatic Absolute Angels, a group of ethereal girls who must consume human life force to survive, possessing the power to bring about the world's destruction. Are these celestial beings truly harbingers of doom, or are they merely pawns in a cruel twist of fate?\n\nAs Kuu navigates this tumultuous world of love, betrayal, and uncertainty, she must unravel the enigma surrounding Kyoshiro's identity and his connection to the prince in her dreams. In her quest for answers, Kuu will not only come to understand her own existence but also confront the challenges that lie ahead.",
