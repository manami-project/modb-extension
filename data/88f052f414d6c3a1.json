    "text": "How about this?\n\nRanma Saotome, a skilled martial artist, and his father, Genma, find themselves in quite the predicament after falling into cursed springs during a training trip to China. Now, whenever they come into contact with cold water, they transform into entirely different beings - Ranma into a girl and Genma into a panda! To make matters worse, Genma has arranged for Ranma to be engaged to one of the daughters of the Tendou dojo, Akane, in the hopes of uniting the two families. But neither Ranma nor Akane are too keen on the idea, and their relationship is anything but smooth sailing. Will Ranma be able to break the curse and find happiness with Akane, or will their constant bickering and martial arts battles get in the way? Tune in to find out!",
