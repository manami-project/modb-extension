    "text": "After a training journey gone awry, martial artist Ranma Saotome and his father Genma fall into cursed springs in China. Now, Ranma transforms into a girl when splashed with cold water while Genma turns into a panda! Seeking to unite their families' schools of martial arts, Genma had arranged for Ranma to marry one of the daughters of his old friend Soun Tendo. However, when Ranma and the short-tempered Akane meet, sparks fly - and not the romantic kind! Forced together by their fathers' pact, the pair antagonize each other constantly, but could there be more to their feelings beneath the surface? Laugh and cringe as the chaos unfolds in this tale of martial arts, magic curses, wacky rivals, unlikely friendships, and maybe even love. Will Ranma find a cure or learn to embrace the mayhem?",
