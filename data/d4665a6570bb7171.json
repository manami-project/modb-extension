    "text": "Set in 19th century Belgium, The Dog of Flanders tells the heartwarming tale of Nello, a poor orphan boy with artistic talents, and his faithful dog Patrasche. Though Nello faces poverty and hardship, he dreams of becoming a great painter like his idol Peter Paul Rubens. When Nello rescues Patrasche from an abusive owner, the two form an unbreakable bond through both joy and sorrow. Nello enters an art contest hoping to win the prize money to fund his painting studies, but a series of misfortunes threatens his dream. Despite the challenges, Nello and Patrasche's devotion never falters. Their remarkable friendship continues until their bittersweet end, immortalized in a statue dedicated by the local Flanders government. Capturing both the beauty of the Flanders countryside and the spirit of this classic tale, the stunning animation brings to life over 130 years of audience affection for Nello and man's best friend.",
