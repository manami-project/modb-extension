    "text": "Cluster wars ravage the ancient land of Disboard, tearing apart the fabric of reality and threatening to annihilate humanity six millennia before the arrival of Sora and Shiro. Amidst the chaos, a young warrior named Riku emerges as humanity's beacon of hope. In a desolate Elf city, he encounters Schwi, an outcast Ex-Machina android banished for her research into human emotions. Schwi is convinced that the power of human feelings has allowed their survival and seeks Riku's guidance to understand the depths of the human heart.\n\nIn a world where the 16 sentient species, known as Exceed, battle to establish the One True God among the Old Deus, humans are on the brink of extinction due to their lack of magic and frailty. However, Riku and Schwi form an improbable alliance, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses as they strive to understand the essence of humanity. Together, they must defy the odds and bring peace to Disboard, preventing the extinction of the human race.\n\nBased on the sixth volume of the light novel series, this movie adaptation follows the journey of Riku and Schwi as they navigate through chaos and war, discovering the true meaning of being human.",
