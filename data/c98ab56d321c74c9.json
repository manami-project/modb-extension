  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Adapts the arcs Koyomi Stone, Koyomi Flower, Koyomi Sand, and more from the Koyomimonogatari light novel, this third season of the Monogatari Series delves into untold stories surrounding Koyomi Araragi and his encounters with the strange and supernatural. Over the course of a year, one episode per month, Koyomi finds himself helping the heroines of the series solve mysteries and navigate the unusual happenings in their lives. From exploring stone shrines to playing hide and seek, Koyomi is always ready to lend a hand to his friends in both the human and supernatural realms. These short stories serve as a prelude to the last chapter of Koyomi's tale and offer a glimpse into the quieter moments before the next apparition-related issue arises. Originally premiered on the Japan-exclusive Koyomimonogatari mobile app, this 12 episode-long series of shorts is a must-watch for Monogatari fans.",
