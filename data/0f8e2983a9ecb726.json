  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a devastating Third World War, Japan lies in ruins, with the city of Tokyo now called Toshima under the ruthless control of an organization named Vischio. Vischio runs a deadly battle game called Igura, where combatants fight to the death for the entertainment of the masses and a chance to challenge the reigning champion known as Il-re. Into this dystopia steps Akira, a young man falsely accused of murder. With his freedom on the line, Akira is given a single chance to earn exoneration - he must enter and win Igura by defeating Il-re. Joining the game alongside allies like his friend Keisuke and an experienced fighter named Rin, Akira must survive the vicious battles of Igura while uncovering the secrets behind Vischio and the power of Il-re. Once an undefeated champion of a safer battle game called Bl@ster, Akira now fights not just for his life but for his very soul in the deadly Igura tournament.",
