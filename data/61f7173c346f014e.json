Sharing the same daily commute, Makoto's infatuation for Kotonoha grows, leading him to capture her image and set it as his phone's wallpaper. Enter Sekai Saionji, the perceptive and cunning classmate who discovers Makoto's hidden affection for Kotonoha. Instead of exposing him, Sekai takes it upon herself to orchestrate a meeting between the two lovebirds, ultimately resulting in a blossoming romance.\n\nHowever, the web of emotions begins to tangle as Sekai finds herself developing feelings for Makoto. In an unexpected turn of events, she seizes an opportunity to claim a kiss from him as a form of \"repayment\" for her matchmaking efforts. As the story unfolds, the delicate balance of love, friendship, and betrayal hangs in the air, threatening to disrupt the lives of these teenagers forever.\n\n\"School Days\" invites viewers to embark on a rollercoaster ride of emotions, exploring the complexities of young love and the consequences of one's actions. Will Makoto and Kotonoha's love stand the test of time, or will it crumble under the weight of temptation and deceit? Only time will tell in this captivating and suspenseful anime.",
