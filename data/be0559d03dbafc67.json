    "text": "I'll weave a tale of Haruyoshi, an unparalleled exorcist who craved happiness beyond his unmatched strength. Betrayed by his closest allies, he resorted to a clandestine reincarnation technique, hoping for a better life. Reborn as Seika in a magical realm, he found himself part of a noble family renowned for their sorcery. However, Seika was deemed devoid of magical abilities, leaving him overlooked by his kin. Undeterred, he resolved to navigate this new world with the wisdom and power he had amassed in his previous life. As he forged alliances with mystical creatures, Seika embarked on a journey to find the contentment that had eluded him, while carefully avoiding the pitfalls that had led to his downfall before. This is the unique saga of an exorcist's quest for happiness in a fantastical world.",
