  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fairies, the ethereal beings once harnessed as instruments of war, now reside in a world struggling to find peace. In this realm, fairies inhabit animals, bestowing them with extraordinary abilities. By transplanting the organs of these possessed creatures into humans, individuals can summon fairies as formidable weapons, earning the title of 'Fairy Soldiers.' After a relentless war, these soldiers found themselves aimless, grappling to adapt to a society no longer in need of their unique skills. Some found solace in government roles, while others turned to crime or even terrorism, each carving their own path in this new world.\n\nNine years after the war's end, the government remains unstable, and the scars of past conflicts still linger. Enter Maria, a newly enlisted member of Dorothea, an organization committed to investigating and curbing fairy-related crimes. Amidst the chaos of a post-war world teetering on the brink, Maria and her fellow Fairy Soldiers strive to uphold justice, navigating a complex landscape of revenge-seeking terrorists and criminals still reeling from the wounds of war. This is a tale of resilience and redemption, as these once-feared warriors forge new identities in a world they once fought to protect.",
