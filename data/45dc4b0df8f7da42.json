    "text": "Time advances, and the once young Waver Velvet, who bravely fought alongside Iskandar during the Fourth Holy Grail War, has matured and assumed the title of Lord El-Melloi II. As a prominent figure in the Clock Tower, the sanctuary for all mages, Lord El-Melloi II leads the Modern Magecraft Theories department and frequently imparts wisdom to his students. However, his disdain for the internal power struggles among the nobility often leads to confrontations.\n\nOne day, while traveling with his apprentice Gray, Lord El-Melloi II encounters a tragic sight: a stray cat, which had recently become a familiar presence in his room, has been struck by a car. Recognizing this as a sinister plot on his life, Lord El-Melloi II embarks on a mission to uncover the culprit, accompanied by Gray, Flat, and Svin.\n\nAs Lord El-Melloi II delves deeper into the investigation, trouble stirs among the mages of the Association, and a mysterious shadow begins to follow him and Gray. The stage is set for a thrilling adventure filled with magic, mystery, and intrigue.",
