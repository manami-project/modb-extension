    "text": "Nine-Character Mantra Tower, and vowing to fight the evil forces of the sect to the end.\n\nIn the mystical realm of the Canglan Continent, cultivation is the key to power, and only those who awaken a Martial Spirit can embark on this path. Qin Nan, a prodigy hailing from Linshui City, was destined for greatness until he awakened a mere grade 1 Martial Spirit, casting him aside as a worthless disciple. However, fate had other plans when a bolt of lightning struck Qin Nan during his martial arts training, bestowing upon him the Divine Battle Spirit - a Martial Spirit with a hidden potential to level up, breaking the ultimate rule of the Canglan Continent.\n\nAs the Xuanling Sect, the most prestigious of the four major sects, descends upon Shuicheng to select disciples after many years, the rivalry between the Fang and Qin families intensifies. With his unwavering dedication, innate talent, and the newly acquired God of War Soul, Qin Nan triumphs over the Fang family under the watchful eye of the messenger Xiao Qingxue, reversing the decline of his family's fortunes.\n\nUpon entering the sect, Qin Nan inadvertently incurs the wrath of Ouyang Jun, the sect leader's son, due to his involvement in Xiao Qingxue's forced marriage. Driven by a desire to grow stronger and repay Xiao Qingxue's kindness, Qin Nan vanquishes formidable foes, secures first place in the Wanxiang Competition and the Outer Sect Competition, and gains entry to the Wuyuan Pavilion alongside the four major sect geniuses.",
