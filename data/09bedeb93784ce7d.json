  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Osaka Shochikuza theater's beloved spring anthem, \"Sakura Saku Kuni,\" takes center stage in the enchanting anime, \"Song of Spring.\" This delightful piece of music, known today as \"Cherry Blossom Country\" and performed by the OSK Nippon Revue Company, is beautifully complemented by intricate, ornamental animations crafted from colored paper. Originally a record talkie, the anime was released in 16mm and 9.5mm Path√© Baby versions by Chiyogami Graph, though the existing version is currently without sound.\n\n\"Song of Spring\" captures the essence of the season as sakura trees burst into bloom, and festivals fill the air with joy and laughter. The anime transports viewers into a vibrant world of blossoming petals and lively dances, inviting them to join in the springtime celebrations. As the cherry blossom country sings and dances, the anime presents a visual feast that is sure to captivate and inspire.",
