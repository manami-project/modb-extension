  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Witches are people with supernatural abilities like telekinesis, mind control, and more. They have existed for centuries but became rare over time. Recently however, Japan has seen an uptick in witch activity. To combat this, a secret global organization called STN that tracks and detains witches has established a division in Japan called STN-J. Their goal is to capture witches alive rather than kill them in order to understand how they gained their powers. STN-J suffers a loss when one of their witch hunters is killed. As a replacement, STN sends 15-year old Robin Sena, herself a powerful witch, from Italy to join the Japanese division. With her impressive skills but also deep mysteries surrounding her own powers, Robin struggles to find her place among the seasoned yet troubled members of STN-J. Both she and the team face growing threats from the resurgent witch population and hidden truths about the nature of witches. As the dangers mount, Robin must come to terms with her identity as a witch and make decisions that will chart a dramatic new course for herself and STN-J.",
