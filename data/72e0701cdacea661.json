  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2061, Japan has lost its sovereignty and is oppressed by four major economic blocs that rule the divided nation. The Japanese people live in fear as massive humanoid weapons called AMAIM, deployed by each faction, patrol the streets. Amou Shiiba, a young mechanic who loves machines, has a chance encounter with Gai, an autonomous AI seeking an energy source. Inspired by Gai, Amou begins rebuilding an abandoned AMAIM he names Kenbu, hoping to stand up for his people. However, Amou's actions cast him as a terrorist threat in the eyes of the authorities. Though now a wanted dissident, Amou refuses to bow to injustice. What begins as a quiet act of defiance sparks into a burning quest to liberate Japan from its oppressors. Amou takes up the mantle of resistance, prepared to risk everything for independence. His fellow compatriots rally behind him as he pilots Kenbu into battle, the fate of Japan hanging in the balance.",
