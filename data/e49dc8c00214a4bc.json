  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so begins the tale of Hikaru Genji, a cherished son born to the Emperor from a humble concubine during the Heian era. Known as the Shining Prince, Hikaru is showered with affection and indulgence, yet he remains distant from the imperial throne due to his commoner status. This distance, however, grants him the freedom to pursue a life of pleasure and passion, as he captivates the hearts of numerous women across the land.\n\nFrom the enchanting Rokujou, a woman of beauty and intellect, to the tender Yuugao, Hikaru's charm knows no bounds. Yet, despite the allure of his many romantic conquests, Hikaru finds himself yearning for a love that remains forever out of reach. Haunted by the memory of his late mother, the Kiritsubo Consort, he finds her likeness in Fujitsubo and becomes hopelessly infatuated. As Hikaru embarks on a journey of self-discovery and desire, he must navigate the complexities of love and longing in a world where power and status dictate the rules of the heart.",
