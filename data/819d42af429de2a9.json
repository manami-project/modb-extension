    "text": "Though they've already achieved success with their live show, the girls of Poppinâ€™Party are far from complacent. Balancing rehearsals, side jobs, and student council duties, they remain focused on their dream. When Kasumi Toyama discovers an opportunity to perform at the prestigious Nippon Budokan, the band leaps at the chance. But they're not the only ones vying for the spotlight; rival band Raise A Suilen is also in the running, despite lacking a guitarist. As the BanG Dream competition looms, Poppin'Party faces old friends and new challengers, pushing them to their limits to prove they have what it takes to claim victory on stage. Meanwhile, Raise A Suilen's founder, Chiyu, holds a grudge against Roselia's lead Yukina, and is determined to use her resources to outshine both Roselia and Poppin'Party. Can Poppin'Party rise to the occasion and produce their own music video to keep up with the competition? Only time will tell as they embark on this thrilling musical journey.",
