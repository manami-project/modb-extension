Inspired, they set their sights on participating and taking the stage at this prestigious event. However, they face fierce competition from other bands like Raise A Suilen, a musically gifted group assembled by Chiyu, who seeks vengeance against the band Roselia. As Poppin'Party strives towards perfecting their sound and producing creative works like music videos, their dedication is put to the test. Their friendship and teamwork faces trials as well. However, Kasumi and the other band members remain determined to share their passion for music, continue improving, and ultimately realize their rock n' roll dreams. Other bands like Afterglow, Pastel*Palettes, Roselia, and Hello Happy World! also make appearances, showcasing their musical talents across Japan. With a diverse array of girl bands demonstrating their capabilities, the BanG Dream competition promises a spectacular lineup.
