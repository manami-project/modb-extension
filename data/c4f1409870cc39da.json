    "text": "Among the ranks of the Japanese air force, a unique team of fighters emerges, blending the worlds of music and military defense. The Toreishi sisters—Kanna, Yayoi, Satsuki, Uzuki, and Mina—form the idol group Hummingbird, a quintet of talented singers and skilled pilots. In a nation where civilian organizations command the air force, these young women find themselves at the forefront of both the entertainment industry and national security.\n\nBalancing their time between the cockpit and the stage, the Hummingbirds captivate audiences with their enchanting melodies and protect their homeland from looming overseas threats. Their journey to the top of the music charts is guided by video director Kudo, who recognizes their potential and helps shape their debut performance.\n\nAs they navigate the challenges of their dual roles, the Hummingbirds rise to become Japan's most celebrated idol group and its first line of defense, showcasing the power of love through their songs and the courage to defend their nation in times of peril.",
