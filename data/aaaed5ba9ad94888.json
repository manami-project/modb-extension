    "text": "Legend tells of a Dragon God residing in the Divine Domain, where the one who inherits the dragon's power will become the new ruler of the land. Various sects and clans vie for this coveted dragon inheritance, resorting to violent conflict. Protagonist Chu Qianye bears an undeserved stigma - deemed the son of a sinner because his father once lost their sect's treasured possession. Seeking to clear his father's name and undo this injustice, Chu Qianye journeys to the Divine Domain in search of clues. There, he finds himself fatefully tied to the Dragon God's legacy in unexpected ways. Through tests of wit and courage, Chu Qianye strives to claim the dragon inheritance. Yet greater forces are at play, and meddling by warring factions threatens to engulf the Divine Domain in chaos. Chu Qianye walks a precarious path - one misstep could destroy any hope of reclaiming his family's honor.",
