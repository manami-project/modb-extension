  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Project Scard takes place in the Akatsuki Special Ward, a lawless zone in Tokyo that was abandoned by the government after a rebellion. Three main groups now maintain order in Akatsuki using agents called \"Scards.\" Scards possess divine tattoos that grant them supernatural abilities. Helios is comprised of Scards who use their powers to protect Akatsuki's citizens from the chaos and violence that plagues the ward. Artemis also employs Scards but has commercial interests in mind over protecting the people. The Public Safety Bureau is made up of Scard agents from the Tokyo police force seeking to uphold justice. Despite their differences, the Scard groups regularly cross paths while contending with the various criminal organizations vying for control in Akatsuki. Through these encounters, unlikely friendships and trust emerge. However, the ward remains beset by greed, turmoil, and danger. The story follows individuals like Eiji Arashiba, known as the Hero of Akatsuki for safeguarding the people from tyrants. After Eiji sacrifices himself to save a boy named Yamato Kai, Yamato gains Eiji's divine tattoo and must decide if he will take up Eiji's mantle to become the next Hero of Akatsuki.",
