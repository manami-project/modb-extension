  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the land of Terra, natural disasters have caused people to take refuge in mobile cities. However, the mineral Originium left behind at disaster sites has accelerated technological progress. It has also spread the incurable disease Oripathy, which crystallizes victims' bodies. Infected individuals face persecution and forced labor in many nations. Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals strives to cure Oripathy and end the suffering it causes. When the rebel group Reunion attacks cities to liberate the infected, Rhodes Island takes up arms to oppose them. After Reunion destroys her homeland Chernobog, Chief Ch'en of Lungmen's Special Inspection Unit defends against their next attack. Meanwhile, Rhodes Island's leaders Amiya and the Doctor battle Reunion commander FrostNova, whose icy powers can freeze enemies to death. Though advanced, Rhodes Island has met its match against the ruthless Reunion rebellion.",
