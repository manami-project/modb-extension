  "synopsis": {
    "text": "First ly, we delve into the world of Luo Xiao Hei Zhan Ji with a series of specials that boast fresh animation, yet lack conventional episode numbers. One such special uncovers a tale of students resorting to cheating during their final exam, nestled between CAT.2 and CAT.3.\n\nSecondly, an official parody episode, humorously labeled CAT8.5, promises a delightful detour from the main storyline.\n\nThirdly, a captivating music video graces the screen between CAT.10 and CAT.11, providing an audiovisual spectacle for viewers.\n\nFourthly, another music video serves as a bridge between CAT.24 and CAT.25, further enriching the series' musical repertoire.\n\nLastly, a fifth music video makes its appearance following the conclusion of CAT.28, offering a melodious epilogue to the viewing experience.",
