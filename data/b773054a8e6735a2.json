  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yu Hai is a mystical realm, a land untouched by human feet yet intricately connected to our world. The ethereal beings residing here govern the natural order of human life, from the ebb and flow of emotions to the changing of seasons. Among these spirits is Chun, a young girl brimming with curiosity about the human world. On her sixteenth birthday, Chun transforms into a dolphin to explore the human realm, only to find herself ensnared in a fishing net during a violent storm. A selfless human boy attempts to rescue her but tragically drowns in the process, leaving Chun grief-stricken.\n\nDetermined to repay the boy's kindness, Chun embarks on a poignant journey to revive his soul, now reincarnated as a small white fish. As she navigates the complexities of love, death, and maturing emotions, Chun grapples with her newfound powers and the limitations of her abilities. This enchanting tale of sacrifice and redemption forces Chun to confront the consequences of disrupting the natural order, ultimately leading her to question the extent of her sacrifice to save a single human life.",
