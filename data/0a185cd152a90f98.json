  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Growing up in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by nuclear winter, Ren Xiaosu and his younger brother Yan Liuyuan are forced to navigate a harsh and unforgiving society. With humans no longer at the top of the food chain, mutated species roam the land, and resources are scarce. To survive, people have constructed walled strongholds and fringe towns, but many still live outside the barriers, making a living by hunting in the wilderness.\n\nRen Xiaosu and Yan Liuyuan are two such individuals, bound together by circumstance rather than blood. As they struggle to make a living and protect each other, they discover their own supernatural powers. Determined to create a better life, Ren Xiaosu sets out for Jingshan, facing dangers at every turn, from wolf attacks to encounters with mutant creatures.\n\nIn this world where only the strong survive, Ren Xiaosu's positive energy and tenacious willpower may be the key to changing the world. Can he use his newfound powers to overcome the crises that threaten humanity and build a new era from the ashes of the old one? Only time will tell.",
