    "text": "Officer Tanya Degurechaff and her 203rd Air Mage Battalion return home in 1926, victorious against the remnants of the Republic's army. Instead of a well-deserved rest, they receive urgent orders from headquarters: a formidable enemy is gathering forces near the border with the Russy Federation. As the Empire prepares for a potential new conflict, a multinational force led by the Allied Kingdom marches into the Federation's territory. The old adage \"the enemy of my enemy is my friend\" seems to apply, but within the Allied Kingdom's ranks lurks Mary Sioux, a young woman driven by vengeance against the Empire for her father's death. With tensions rising and the world on the brink of war, will the Empire triumph, or will it succumb to the ideological storm that threatens to engulf it?",
