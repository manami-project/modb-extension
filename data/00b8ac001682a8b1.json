  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Many years ago, Duke Fleed was the crown prince of planet Fleed, but was forced to flee when the ruthless Vegan Empire attacked and depopulated his home planet. Duke escaped to Earth with the mighty super robot Grandizer, vowing never to pilot it again in order to keep it hidden from the Vegans. In the present day, a group of UFOs from planet Vega track down Duke on Earth. Their leader is Duke's childhood love, the daughter of King Vega. She demands Duke hand over Grandizer or watch Earth be destroyed by the Vegan fleet. Now, after years in hiding, Duke Fleed faces an impossible choice - violate his vow to protect Grandizer and defend his adopted home of Earth, or stand aside as the Vegan Empire obliterates the planet. The fate of Earth hangs in the balance as Duke wrestles with reawakening his mighty super robot to confront the Vegans, even if it means opposing his former love.",
