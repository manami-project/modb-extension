    "text": "Many years have passed since Duke Fleed, the crown prince of the distant planet Fleed, narrowly escaped the devastating attack of King Vega's ruthless armies. As the sole survivor of his decimated home world, he sought refuge on Earth, assuming the identity of Daisuke Umon. Desperate to protect his adopted planet from the same fate that befell his own, he concealed the formidable Grendizer robot and swore never to wield its power again.\n\nHowever, the past has a way of catching up with those who outrun it. When a fleet of UFOs, led by his former love and King Vega's daughter, descends upon Earth, Duke Fleed is faced with an impossible ultimatum: surrender the mighty Grendizer or bear witness to the annihilation of his newfound home.\n\nAs the Vegan UFO Fleet menaces Earth, Duke Fleed must grapple with the consequences of his vow. Will he stand idly by as his adopted planet faces destruction, or will he rise to the challenge, embrace his destiny, and pilot the Grendizer to defend Earth against the relentless onslaught of King Vega's forces? This pilot episode sets the stage for the thrilling series \"UFO Robo Grendizer.\"",
