  "synopsis": {
    "text": "For high school student Kei and at least forty-six others, immortality comes unexpectedly and undesirably. They are viewed not as superheroes but as rare \"demi-humans\" that need to be hunted down by governments and experimented on endlessly for scientific gain. Seventeen years ago, the first immortal beings appeared on African battlefields. Since then, new types of immortal lifeforms called \"Ajin\" have emerged among humans. On his way home from school, Japanese high schooler Kei gets killed in a traffic accident but then revives. Now with a price on his head, Kei must go on the run, pursued by all of humankind who want to capture him. This is the premise of a story that follows a high school boy who attains immortality and must evade relentless pursuit by those who want to exploit his condition. It promises action and intrigue as the newly immortal Kei navigates a world that sees him as a specimen to be detained and experimented on rather than a human being.",
