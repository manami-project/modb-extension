  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the life of an ordinary high school student, Kei, who, along with 46 others, is thrust into the unimaginable world of immortality. However, this gift is far from a blessing; it's a curse that transforms them into sought-after specimens, hunted by both the public and governments. Known as 'Ajin' or demi-humans, they are subjected to a life of endless experimentation for the advancement of humanity.\n\nThe story takes a dramatic turn when Kei is killed in a traffic accident on his way home from school, only to miraculously revive. This unexpected resurrection marks the beginning of his relentless pursuit by society. The narrative unfolds as Kei navigates this treacherous existence, evading capture while grappling with his new reality.\n\nThe second movie in the trilogy delves deeper into this world, where immortals first emerged on African battlefields 17 years ago. Kei's life hangs in the balance as he becomes a target, forcing him to embark on a life on the run from all of humanity.",
