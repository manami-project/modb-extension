  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiding from the remnants of a catastrophic event known as the \"Tears of the New Moon\" that unleashed a deadly poison called Blueschist, humanity in the year 2242 has been forced to take refuge in scattered underground settlements called Nests. In these desperate times, Kanata, an enthusiast of pre-disaster artifacts, dreams of becoming a Drifter, a brave warrior who pilots a powerful mecha known as a Coffin to collect precious AO crystals and fend off monstrous creatures called Enders. One day, Kanata and his friend Tokio stumble upon an inactive Magus, an advanced AI resembling a human woman. Kanata, driven by his passion for collecting, decides to take the Magus with him and repair her. Upon awakening, the Magus, now named Noir, suffers from amnesia and appears to possess no extraordinary abilities. However, when an Ender attack threatens their shelter, Noir reveals her true potential as she skillfully pilots the Coffin alongside Kanata. Together, they embark on a dangerous journey to uncover Noir's lost memories and seek the mythical city of Histoire, a place that Kanata has always longed to find. As they navigate through this post-apocalyptic world, Kanata and Noir will discover the true meaning of being a Drifter and unravel the secrets that bind humanity's past and future.",
