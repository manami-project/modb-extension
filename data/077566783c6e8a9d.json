    "text": "Keita is a high school student living with his twin stepsisters Ako and Riko after his mother's passing and his father's remarriage. Though not blood-related, Ako and Riko are openly amorous towards Keita, competing for his romantic affection through intimate advances despite Keita's initial discomfort. As Keita studies for his entrance exams to attend Ako and Riko's high school, he grapples with conflicting emotions, both rejecting and becoming tempted by his sisters' seduction. His friends, peers and even parents encourage the taboo relationship, placing pressure on the conflicted Keita. With exams approaching amidst escalating temptation, Keita faces distraction and self-doubt. He must find the willpower to focus himself academically while also deciding whether to give in to or resist his sisters' inappropriate yet alluring displays of incestuous love.",
