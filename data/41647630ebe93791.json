  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yabuki Joe, after a tragic incident in the ring that led to the death of his opponent Rikiishi, finds himself grappling with guilt and fear. Six months later, he decides to make a comeback, securing five knockouts with body blows. The boxing commission, however, sees this as an opportunity to take him down and offers him a shot at the national title. The reigning champion, Tiger Ozaki, exploits Joe's fear of landing face punches, a fear stemming from Rikiishi's death, leading to Joe's corner throwing in the towel. In an effort to help Joe overcome his fears and reach his full potential, his love interest and gym owner, Youko, enlists the help of Carlos Rivera, a world-ranked boxer from Venezuela. With Carlos's guidance, Joe embarks on a journey to reclaim his confidence and aim for the regional and world ranks.",
