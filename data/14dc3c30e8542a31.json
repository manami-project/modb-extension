    "text": "She was born into a noble family with supernatural abilities, but Miyo Saimori was cast aside for her lack of talent. Treated as a servant by her own family, Miyo's life seemed to be a never-ending cycle of misery. However, when she is arranged to marry Kiyoka Kudou, a nobleman with a reputation for being cold and cruel, Miyo's life takes an unexpected turn. Instead of the heartless man she was expecting, Miyo finds a kind and sensitive husband who treats her with the respect and love she has always deserved. As they slowly open up to each other, Miyo and Kiyoka begin to heal from their past traumas and find hope for a brighter future together. Will this marriage be the blessing that Miyo has been searching for, or will it be yet another curse in her already troubled life?",
