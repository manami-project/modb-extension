  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a future where humanity has colonized multiple planets, the Tytania clan rules the Valdana Empire through intimidation and economic power. However, cracks begin forming in their iron grip on the empire when the city-state of Euriya scores an unexpected victory against a Tytanian fleet. This act of defiance sparks hope in oppressed factions seeking to overthrow Tytanian rule. As rebellion spreads, tensions flare within the empire as Tytania family members scheme against each other, vying for power and control. At the center of it all is Fan Hulic, the daring Euriyan admiral who led the improbable defeat of the mighty Tytanian navy. With a bounty on his head and betrayal on all sides, Hulic races across the stars searching for allies in his quest to shatter the Tytania dynastyâ€™s domination once and for all. Outgunned but resolute, Hulic and his ragtag resistance movement wage a guerrilla war to liberate humanity from generations of Tytanian oppression. The fate of the empire hangs in the balance as the Tytanian grip on power threatens to slip in the face of a growing populist uprising.",
