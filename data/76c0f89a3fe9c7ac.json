    "text": "Hana Ichinose is a shy and introverted 17-year-old girl who has enrolled into high school a year later than her classmates. Due to personal reasons, she moved away from her parents' home in the city to live with her cousin Shion in an apartment called Temari Heights. As Hana starts at her new high school, she feels anxious and insecure about being older than the other students. On her first day, the teacher reveals it's Hana's birthday, allowing her to meet three friendly classmates - the cheerful Tamate Momochi, the small and shy Kanmuri Sengoku, and the pretty and popular Eiko Tokura. Despite her shyness, Hana gradually opens her heart to these new friends and her life begins to change in exciting and heartwarming ways. She experiences fun childhood moments like playing games, as well as more mature situations that make her feel like an adult. With courage and effort, Hana works hard to catch up with her classmates. This is an uplifting coming-of-age story about Hana beginning a \"slow start\" in her new environment, slowly overcoming insecurities, and blossoming through wonderful new friendships.",
