  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From the perspective of a typical 17-year-old, Hana Ichinose's life seems ordinary, but there's a hidden secret she holds close to her heart: she enrolled in high school a year later than her peers. Determined to catch up and fit in, Hana embarks on a journey filled with new experiences and friendships after moving into her cousin Shion's apartment complex, Temari Heights.\n\nAs a shy and introverted girl, Hana initially finds it difficult to connect with her classmates, but when her teacher reveals it's her birthday during her introduction, it opens the door to meeting three unique girls: the outgoing Tamate Momochi, the reserved Kanmuri Sengoku, and the popular Eiko Tokura. These encounters mark the beginning of Hana's transformation as she gradually opens up and embraces the exciting and heartwarming moments of growing up at her own pace.\n\n\"Slow Start\" is a delightful and endearing tale of self-discovery, friendship, and the challenges of adolescence that will leave you rooting for Hana as she navigates the complexities of high school life.",
