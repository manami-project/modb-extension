  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ghost in the Shell: Arise - Alternative Architecture is set in 2027, one year after the end of World War IV. The story follows Public Security official Aramaki Daisuke recruiting the full-body cyber prosthesis user and hacker Motoko Kusanagi to investigate a bombing in Newport City that killed a major arms dealer with potential ties to the mysterious 501 Organization. Working the case with Motoko is her team in the newly formed Public Security Section 9, consisting of former Ranger Batou, Detective Togusa who is investigating a series of murders, and Lt. Colonel Kurutsu who wants to monitor Motoko's actions. As the team digs deeper into the bombing, bits of their mysterious pasts come to light. The story spans eight TV-length episodes edited from the previous Arise OVAs along with two new broadcast-exclusive episodes. The new \"Pyrophoric Cult\" arc involves the dangerous \"Fire Starter\" virus explored earlier and introduces the new character Pyromania, while tying into the broader Ghost in the Shell storyworld.",
