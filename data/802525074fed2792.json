  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From the outside, the Miyagawa siblings appear to be an unlikely pair. Atsushi, an 11-year-old elementary school student, towers above his peers at 180 centimeters tall, his mature appearance often landing him in hot water. Meanwhile, his 17-year-old sister, Atsumi, barely reaches 137 centimeters, causing others to mistake her for a young child. Despite their contrasting appearances, the siblings share a strong bond, navigating the daily challenges and misunderstandings that their unique situation presents. From Atsushi's encounters with law enforcement to Atsumi's frequent offerings of children's candy, the Miyagawa household is never short of excitement and laughter. Through it all, the siblings remain inseparable, proving that appearances can be deceiving and that family is always there to support you.",
