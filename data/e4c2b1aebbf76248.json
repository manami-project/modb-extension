  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the information provided, this anime special is part of the series Gakkou no Kaidan and aired several months after the original anime series concluded. However, the events depicted take place chronologically before the finale episode of the TV series. The story centers around a ghostly headless motorcyclist that rides into town on the anniversary of his death. This vengeful spirit aims to attack people by decapitating their heads in a similar manner to how he lost his own head. When the dangerous ghost sets his sights on the character Satsuki, her friends realize they need to urgently find a way to stop the menacing ghost rider before he claims another victim. By bringing this terrifying headless horseman to life, the special aims to thrill viewers by capitalizing on chilling supernatural elements. The threat he poses to the characters also adds suspense and encourages viewers to watch on eagerly to see his defeat. This special delivers more frightening adventures from Gakkou no Kaidan while also tying into key events from the main anime series.",
