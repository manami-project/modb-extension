    "text": "Ancient aliens and high school hijinks collide in this two-part anime special! In 'Urusei Yatsura All-Star All-Out Attack!', viewers are treated to a recap of the first 21 episodes, including the fateful day when Ataru Moroboshi's mundane life was upended by the arrival of extraterrestrial invaders. With the planet's fate resting on his shoulders, Ataru must outwit the Oni leader's daughter, Lum, in a game of tag. As the series progresses, Ataru's mother reminisces about the eclectic cast of characters her son has encountered, both human and alien, and wonders if her family will ever know peace again.\n\nIn the second part, 'The School Excursion! Run, Kunoichi!', Ataru's school trip to Nara takes an unexpected turn when he stumbles upon a confidential scroll dropped by a young ninja named Kaede. As Kaede struggles with doubts about her ninja abilities, she must navigate past Lum to retrieve the scroll from Ataru. Will she succeed, or will Ataru's clueless antics thwart her mission? This original episode offers a fresh and exciting adventure that's not part of the ongoing series.",
