Lupin goes undercover as a prison warden in the Zufu Republic to gather information about the treasure's location, but when his presence is discovered, a $1 million bounty is placed on his head, attracting a band of ruthless bounty hunters. With the corrupt police chief and the ruthless dictator General Headhunter also standing in their way, Lupin and his gang must use all of their cunning and skill to outwit their enemies and claim the treasure.
