    "text": "Koji's life as a rock idol seems perfect from the outside, with his striking blonde hair and a successful career. However, he feels an emptiness inside that fame and fortune can't fill. One fateful night, he encounters Takuto Izumi, a brown-haired soccer player with a dark past and a dream to go pro. Despite Izumi's initial dislike for Koji, the rock idol finds himself drawn to Izumi's passion and strength. As Koji grapples with his feelings for Izumi, he learns about Izumi's tragic past and the guilt he carries over his father's murder. Despite the challenges they face, including Koji's older brothers' attempts to separate them, the two young men must decide if they can support each other and overcome their fears to find love. Will Koji's love for Izumi mirror the intense love that Izumi's mother had for his father, or will their pasts and insecurities drive them apart?",
