  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2016, a manned spacecraft returning from Mars explodes in Earth's atmosphere, scattering fragments containing alien DNA across Japan. This DNA infects humans, transforming them into violent monsters called \"Ancients\" that wreak havoc. To combat the Ancients, a special police force called the AAST develops an advanced battlesuit named \"MARS.\" However, due to genetic compatibility issues, only a few people can pilot it. The story follows Takeru Hinata, a troubled teenager who is one of the compatible MARS pilots. Together with a team of specialist girls, Takeru uses the MARS suit to fight back against the Ancients. However, the Ancients soon reveal a shocking claim: it is actually humans who invaded Earth long ago. Now Takeru and his team must continue battling the relentless Ancients while also searching for the real truth behind humanity's origins. Their investigation takes an personal turn as Takeru confronts his own mysterious past. With the fate of the planet at stake, the group races to unlock the secrets of the Ancients and their connection to Mars before it's too late.",
