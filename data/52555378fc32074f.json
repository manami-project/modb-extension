  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ari-chan is an inquisitive young ant who one day wanders away from the anthill and discovers a mysterious object - a tiny violin - left behind in the sandpit. Intrigued, Ari-chan picks up the violin and takes it back to show his friends. Together, the ants experiment with the odd contraption, plucking the strings and sliding the bow across them, filling the air with beautiful music. As time passes, Ari-chan comes to realize that this enchanting object must have great significance to someone. Though he cherishes the joy it has brought him and his fellow ants, in his heart Ari-chan knows the violin belongs to another. So, with bittersweet fondness, the little ant sets off to return the treasured violin to its rightful owner. This charming story follows the adventures of Ari-chan and celebrates virtues of curiosity, friendship, and doing the right thing even when it means parting with something dear. With earnestness and pluck, Ari-chan's tale is one that will speak to the child in all of us.",
