    "text": "One of the strongest high school students and a formidable fighter, Baki, continues his quest to become the ultimate warrior in the latest season of Hanma Baki. After emerging victorious against formidable foes like Biscuit \"Mr. Unchained\" Oliva and Jun \"Mr. Second\" Guevaru in Arizona State Prison, Baki sets his sights on a new challenge: a prehistoric man named Pickle. Preserved in salt and discovered in a waste facility beneath Colorado, Pickle is a force to be reckoned with, having once hunted dinosaurs. As chaos unfolds in Tokyo, various fighters attempt to take on Pickle, only to be defeated. Baki realizes that in order to face his overpowered father, Yujiro Hanma, he must first overcome this seemingly insurmountable obstacle. Will Baki's strength and determination be enough to take down Pickle and pave the way for a final showdown with his father? Only time will tell as the intense battles of Hanma Baki continue to unfold.",
