  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To the unsuspecting eye, Nueno Meisuke, fondly known as Nube, is just another affable, slightly clumsy teacher at Domori Elementary. But beneath the facade of his ordinary life, Nube harbors a formidable secret: his left hand is a demon's claw, a powerful tool he uses to combat the malevolent spirits and supernatural beings that plague his students.\n\nWhen Nube was a child, he sealed a demon into his left hand, a daring act that granted him extraordinary powers to vanquish evil. Now, as a teacher, he dedicates his life to safeguarding his beloved students from the sinister forces lurking in the shadows.\n\nDespite the constant battles against the supernatural, Nube remains steadfast in his duties as an educator. He strives to provide a safe learning environment for his students, all while pursuing the affections of the charming Ritsuko-sensei.\n\nIn this thrilling tale of love, courage, and sacrifice, Hell Teacher Nube proves that sometimes, it takes more than a textbook to teach life's most important lessons.",
