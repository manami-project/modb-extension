  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The vampire students of the elite Night Class are holding an election to decide the next Moon Dorm president. The candidates are the current president Takuma Ichijou and dorm leader Kaname Kuran. Hanabusa Aidou eagerly campaigns on Kaname's behalf, making posters and questioning Ichijou's supporters. However, Kaname shows little interest in running and even endorses Ichijou instead. This leaves Aidou's enthusiastic efforts fruitless and the election likely to go in Ichijou's favor, unless the other vampires decide to rally behind the reluctant Kaname out of loyalty. Whichever way the night class votes, the election seems set to disrupt dorm politics and relationships.",
