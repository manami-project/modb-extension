Just as peace seemed to have finally settled, Nobunaga's successor, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, summons the dreaded Genma forces, threatening to plunge Japan back into a dark, demonic era. A formidable warrior named Soki, armed with the sinister power of the Oni, learns of Toyotomi's nefarious plan to spread Genma insects, turning soldiers into indestructible killing machines. As Toyotomi's illegitimate son, Soki embarks on a perilous journey to vanquish the Genma and burn the Genma trees, preventing the impending chaos.
