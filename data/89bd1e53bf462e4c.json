    "text": "Fifteen years after Nobunaga Oda's defeat, Japan faces another threat - his successor Hideyoshi Toyotomi plans to unleash the demonic Genma forces to help him conquer the world. He intends to possess soldiers with Genma insects, turning them into unstoppable killing machines. The only one who can stop this is Soki, Toyotomi's illegitimate son. Soki possesses the dark Oni power and sets out on a journey to burn the Genma trees and defeat the rampaging Genma. With the help of warriors joining his side, he hopes to prevent Toyotomi from carrying out his scheme and plunging Japan back under the Genma's shadow.",
