While Ryuuichi, a high school student, navigates his new role as the primary caregiver for his toddler brother, Kotarou grapples with the reality of their situation. Their lives take an unexpected turn when they are offered a home by Youko Morinomiya, the chairwoman of a prestigious academy, who also bears the loss of her son and daughter-in-law in the same accident.\n\nHowever, this act of kindness comes with a condition. In order to secure a roof over their heads and enrollment in the academy, Ryuuichi must take on the responsibility of babysitting at the school's understaffed daycare center. As the first member of the newly established Babysitter's Club, Ryuuichi not only has to care for his brother but also look after a group of lively toddlers belonging to the school's female teachers.\n\nIn this heartwarming tale of resilience and camaraderie, Ryuuichi and Kotarou find solace in their new environment, forging new friendships and gradually rebuilding their lives amidst the joyous chaos of the daycare center.",
