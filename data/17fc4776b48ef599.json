  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the crimson moon ascends, the end of days is said to be nigh. In the wake of countless monster skirmishes, Ren and his comrades have managed to liberate all energy points. However, Nostradamus' ominous prophecy of a desolate future casts a shadow of unease over everyone. As the group grapples with the implications of the prophecy, Mana wrestles with her own confusion regarding Miroku's assertion that she wields 'the power to alter the world.' Walpurgis, who has been observing Mana, finally reveals a concealed truth to her. Simultaneously, Madarame is gearing up to unveil a new initiative to the world. What are his intentions, and what truth did Walpurgis divulge to Mana? Will Ren and his friends be steered towards the grim future foretold in the prophecy? This second installment of the Monsuto anime, unlike its forerunner, is not entirely CG animated, instead opting for a blend of 2D and CG animation. The narrative hurtles towards an exhilarating climax, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats.",
