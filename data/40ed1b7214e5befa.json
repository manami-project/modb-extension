    "text": "Isaku Senagaki, raised by her yakuza boss grandfather after her parents' untimely death, yearns for a typical high school experience filled with friends, love, and normalcy. To escape her gangster ties, she enrolls in a distant high school, only to have her dreams shattered by the intrusion of Keiya Utou, a loyal yakuza member tasked with her protection. Keiya, who bribes his way into her school, remains oblivious to Isaku's one-sided affection, treating her as nothing more than the granddaughter he's sworn to safeguard. As she grapples with her unrequited love and Keiya's overprotective nature, Isaku's pursuit of a normal life becomes an uphill battle, entangled in the complexities of her heart and the shadows of her past.",
