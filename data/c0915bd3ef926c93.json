    "text": "Love and friendship take center stage in this lighthearted romantic comedy anime. As the school year comes to a close, Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to her aloof crush Karasuma before he moves away. Meanwhile, Tenma's eccentric classmate Harima harbors a secret crush on her but lacks the nerve to speak up. When Karasuma announces his plans to study abroad, Tenma and her friends kick their matchmaking schemes into high gear. After a failed attempt to confess during a school marathon event, a dejected Tenma finds comfort from her friends and an unlikely ally in Harima. Emboldened by this support, she steels her resolve for one final confession before Karasuma's departure. Will the oblivious Karasuma recognize Tenma’s affection at last? Does the rough-around-the-edges Harima still have a chance to win Tenma’s heart? As tensions and emotions reach their peak, anything can happen on the final day of school for this endearing group of friends.",
