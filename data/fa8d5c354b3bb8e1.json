    "text": "An ime: Dallos\n\nIn the face of a burgeoning population and dwindling resources, humanity turned to the Moon as a beacon of hope at the close of the 21st century. The lunar landscape, teeming with untapped minerals, revitalized Earth and ushered in an era of prosperity. However, this newfound paradise came at a steep cost for those who dared to leave their terrestrial home and colonize the Moon.\n\nEnter Shun Nonomura, an unsuspecting lunar resident about to stumble upon a powerful weapon with the potential to dismantle the iron-fisted Monopolice and liberate the oppressed colonists. The burgeoning resistance movement swiftly embraces this newfound power and its creator, rallying behind the enigmatic alien artifact known as Dallos.\n\nOriginally released as a series of four OVA episodes, Dallos was later reimagined as a 2-hour movie, which was then further condensed into an 83-minute special. This special edition incorporates additional footage, including 50 extra shots that introduce the world of Dallos in a captivating prologue before the opening credits roll.",
