    "text": "When a murder shakes the adventuring community of Orario, a city built above a colossal underground maze called the Dungeon, the ambitious adventurer Bell Cranel must put his recent level-up to the test. Despite his constant efforts to elevate his Hestia Familia's reputation, they still have a long way to go before they can compete with other Familia in the city. To make matters worse, one of Bell's closest allies is accused of the heinous crime. Determined to clear their name, Bell and his friends embark on a dangerous quest to uncover the truth hidden within the darkest corners of the Dungeon. As they venture deeper than ever before, they unravel a sinister plot that threatens the entire city. This is the tale of a young adventurer and his goddess, a 'Familia Myth' filled with courage, growth, and camaraderie.",
