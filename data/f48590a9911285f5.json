  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akihabara, known as the paradise of anime and manga fans, is infiltrated by dangerous vampire-like creatures called \"Bagurimono\" or \"Synthisters\" that prey on humans. Otaku siblings Tamotsu and Niwaka Denkigai have a frightening encounter with the creatures while out shopping, barely escaping with their lives thanks to the mysterious Matome Mayonaka. Matome saves Tamotsu by turning him into a Bagurimono, gifting him special powers. Tamotsu then bands together with Matome and excitable cosplayer Arisa Ahokainen to form the vigilante group \"The Electric Mayonnaise.\" Their mission is to patrol Akihabara and defeat any Bagurimono they find, protecting the neighborhood's innocent anime fans. They soon discover the only way to permanently defeat a Bagurimono is to strip it naked, exposing its skin directly to sunlight. This necessitates ripping off their clothes in fierce battles across Akihabara's shops and streets. Through their heroic efforts, the Electric Mayonnaise fight to take back Akihabara as a safe haven for otaku once more.",
