However, her world is disrupted by Li Xun, a talented yet rebellious programmer who repeatedly inserts himself into her life. Though seemingly a directionless troublemaker, Li Xun secretly possesses exceptional programming abilities. Zhu Yun also discovers her own aptitude for the field through interactions with Li Xun. When senior student Fang Zhi Jing bullies Zhu Yun, Li Xun defends her and even invites her to join his programming team. Together, Zhu Yun and Li Xun find success in programming competitions and even begin developing romantic feelings for each other, despite their vastly different upbringings. However, just when their business venture seems poised for success, Li Xun's sister gets into a devastating car accident caused by Fang Zhi Jing. In a fury, Li Xun assaults Fang and lands himself in jail. Zhu Yun refuses to abandon Li Xun, patiently waiting for him to complete his sentence. Upon his release, she aids him in reclaiming his company from rivals. Her relentless support finally penetrates Li Xun's pain and emotional barriers, giving him the strength to move forward.",
