  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When divine creativity took a playful twist, the universe witnessed an unconventional genesis. In this whimsical parody of John Houston's grandiose film, 'The Creation,' the tale of the first book of the Bible unfolds with an unexpected twist. In the beginning, there was only an abyss of darkness, a formless and lightless realm where God resided. Over the span of five days, the deity crafted day, sea, land, and a harmonious array of living beings. However, on the sixth day, the divine plan deviated from the scriptures: Eve, not Adam, was the first human to grace the Earth. Only after her creation did God shape Adam from Eve's breast, marking the dawn of human troubles. This short film, adorned with high-quality, deformed pictures, exudes a tongue-in-cheek charm, revealing the work of talented animators who, despite a modest budget, dared to poke fun at grand cinematic masterpieces. Prepare for a divine comedy that reimagines the origins of humanity with a touch of humor and wit.",
