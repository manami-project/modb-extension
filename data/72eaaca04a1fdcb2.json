    "text": "Kanji Yakutani was a dedicated medical researcher who lost his beloved sister to an incurable disease. He devoted his life to developing new medications, but worked himself to death at the young age of 31. When Kanji awakens, he finds his soul reborn into a medieval parallel world in the body of 10-year-old Falma de MÃ©dicis, apprentice to the royal court's head pharmacist. Blessed by the god of medicine, Falma possesses the power to create and destroy substances. He discovers a society where dubious remedies swindle commoners and the Pharmacist Guild monopolizes healthcare for profit. Motivated by his late sister's memory, Falma resolves to use his expertise and abilities to reform the corrupt medical system. He establishes an affordable pharmacy, wiping out malpractice with effective medicines developed through modern pharmacology. Against all odds, the young prodigy battles prejudice and entrenched interests to deliver healthcare advancements to rich and poor alike. His innovations usher in a bold new era of egalitarian medicine.",
