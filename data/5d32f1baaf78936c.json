  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime \"Mahoutsukai no Yome\" is introducing itself to viewers through a series of weekly 30-second shorts posted on Twitter. The shorts feature the main characters Chise, Elias, and Ruth having lighthearted conversations. In the first episode, titled \"#0 Aisatsu\" (#0 Greeting), the characters debate about who should formally introduce the upcoming anime. After some back-and-forth, Chise takes on the responsibility and provides a warm welcome to the show. These playful shorts seem to establish the chemistry between the main trio while building anticipation for the anime's television debut. Each Tuesday a new episode will be posted, while the previous week's short is taken down. With its personable introduction and endearing characters, \"Mahoutsukai no Yome\" aims to cast a magical spell over prospective viewers. The shorts provide a small taste of the charms that await in the full magical fantasy anime.",
