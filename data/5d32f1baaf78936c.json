The delightful clip features a friendly debate among Chise, Elias, and Ruth as they determine who will take the lead in presenting the anime. Ultimately, Chise steps up to introduce the captivating series. In tandem with the weekly release of new television anime episodes, fans can look forward to enjoying a fresh 30-second Maho Yome short on Twitter every Tuesday.
