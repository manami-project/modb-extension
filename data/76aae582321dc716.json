  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an alternate 19th century Japan, Luffy works as a detective trying to keep the peace in the town of Grand Zipangu. However, his job gets complicated when the Clown Clan, led by Buggy, begins rampaging through the town's money exchange. After a confrontation, Buggy escapes and later sends Luffy a threatening note demanding he come alone to the riverbank if he wants to save Onami, the hostess of the Pinwheel Inn. Sometime later, the Clown Clan is back and hunting a wounded girl named Vivi who is hiding at Onami's inn. The clan hires a traveling monk named Zoro to help capture Vivi. Luffy and his allies race to save Vivi and uncover the secret she carries. This special contains two stories featuring the main cast in detective guises, as well as cameos from minor characters in the regular series. It offers an exciting alternate take on the characters in a historical setting as Luffy contends with the criminal antics of Buggy and his clown gang.",
