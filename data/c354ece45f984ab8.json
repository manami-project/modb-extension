    "text": "When the sky turns blood red and the moon black, 17-year-old Satsuki Kakeru and his best friend Yuka find themselves transported to a terrifying alternate dimension plagued by monsters. Joined by five other teenagers - including the stoic swordswoman Kusakabe Misuzu and the unpredictable, bespectacled Hirohara Yukiko - the group bands together to navigate this treacherous realm known as Red Night. Haunted by visions of his sister's suicide years prior, Kakeru discovers he and his new allies are being hunted by sinister entities called Black Knights. To escape the nightmare and solve the mystery of Red Night, they must defeat these dark knights. But greater threats await, like the fragments' hidden connections to one another and to Kakeru's tragic past. With death around every corner, can the fragments piece together the puzzle before their time runs out?",
