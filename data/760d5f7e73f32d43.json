  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyojin Chuugakkou, a junior high school, becomes the new battleground for Eren, Mikasa, and Armin as they navigate the trials and tribulations of adolescence. This spin-off of the popular Attack on Titan series takes a comedic twist on the original's darker themes, placing beloved characters in a school setting where they must contend with Titans who are more interested in stealing their lunches than devouring humans. The series follows the trio as they join the Wall Cleanup Club and engage in various extracurricular activities, all while parodying iconic scenes from the original series. With familiar faces and hilarious antics, Attack on Titan: Junior High promises to entertain both new and returning fans of the franchise. Will Eren and his friends be able to protect their precious bento boxes from the gluttonous Titans? Only time will tell in this light-hearted take on the popular anime.",
