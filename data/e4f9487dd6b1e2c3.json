    "text": "Seven seas hide a sunken treasure, a gold-laden galleon, off the San Francisco coast. Lupin, a cunning thief, has his eyes set on this prize and steals crucial navigational data from the mafia to track it down. But he's not the only one after the gold; a clandestine syndicate known as the Secret Seven is also in pursuit. As Lupin and his trusted partners, Jigen, Goemon, and Fujiko, navigate through the mystery, they find themselves entangled with the California mafia don, Lukino Marcano, who operates a casino cruise and shares the same treasure-hunting ambition.\n\nInspector Zenigata, Lupin's relentless pursuer, teams up with an unusually aggressive local cop to catch Lupin red-handed. As the race to the treasure intensifies, the connection between the gold, Alcatraz Island prison, and John F. Kennedy begins to unravel. With mysterious men in black tailing Lupin and the Secret Seven lurking in the shadows, Lupin must outsmart them all in this thrilling adventure that dives deep into the heart of Alcatraz.",
