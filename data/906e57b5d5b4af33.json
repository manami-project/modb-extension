    "text": "Chiba Yudai joins the cast of the one-hour special episode of The File of Young Kindaichi Returns, titled 'The File of Inspector Akechi,' airing on December 26. In this thrilling installment, high school students Miyuki and Kindaichi encounter Ryuutarou Kobayashi, a detective who was once mentored by the legendary Inspector Akechi. Initially suspected as a thief by Kindaichi, Kobayashi instead proves to be a valuable ally after rescuing Miyuki from a purse theft.\n\nKobayashi recounts his first case with Akechi, involving Youhei Kijima, the delinquent son of a powerful parliament member. Despite repeated charges for theft and other misdeeds, Kijima's political influence shields him from prosecution. When Akechi and Kobayashi solve a bookstore theft implicating Kijima, the investigation is once again suppressed. However, the two determined detectives refuse to back down, leading to a tense confrontation and a thrilling conclusion that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats.",
