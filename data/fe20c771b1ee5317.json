The story unfolds with Queen Elizabeth, the leader of the Royal Navy and the Commander's secretary, engaging in a friendly chess match against her sister ship, Valiant. Confident in her abilities, Elizabeth wagers her status as queen for a day, only to be defeated by Valiant, who seizes the opportunity to assume the coveted role. As Elizabeth experiences the life of an attendant, Valiant grapples with the immense pressure of being a queen. In the second episode, the long-awaited assembly of all nine Azur Lane factions approaches, but a consensus on the theme is reached without the Royal Navy's Queen Elizabeth and Iris Libre's Richelieu. With no space left for their stalls, Elizabeth takes the initiative to persuade the other factions to compromise for the sake of their beloved commander, ensuring the international gathering's success. Witness the thrilling and comical adventures of Queen Elizabeth and her fellow factions as they navigate through challenges and diplomatic disputes in this engaging anime adaptation.",
