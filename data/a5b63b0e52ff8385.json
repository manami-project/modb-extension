  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This lighthearted magical anime follows Koyomi, a young girl struggling to learn magic. Her teacher Misa focuses on modern magic, but with little success - Koyomi can only manage to summon washbasins. Concerned, their friend Yumiko decides to step in and teach Koyomi classical magic instead. In a special \"Advanced Broadcast\" episode aired before the main series, Yumiko tries her best to instruct Koyomi, titled \"cruncha cruncha cruncha.\" Despite Yumiko's efforts, Koyomi still only produces washbasins, much to Yumiko's mounting frustration. As the teachers look on, it becomes clear Koyomi may need more help unlocking her magical potential. But the upbeat tone suggests this cheerful girl will get there in the end, with a little laughter and friendship along the way.",
