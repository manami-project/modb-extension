  "synopsis": {
    "text": "An additional episode, titled 'cruncha cruncha cruncha', unfolds in the midst of the main anime series. This special broadcast was aired ahead of the actual series and showcases Yumiko's growing concern over Koyomi's magical education under Misa's guidance. As Koyomi continues to summon nothing but washbasins, Yumiko takes it upon herself to introduce Koyomi to the intricacies of Classical Magic, believing that Misa's Modern Magic teachings aren't yielding the desired results. Even as Misa and Kaho watch on, Yumiko's frustration mounts as Koyomi's magical abilities refuse to progress beyond the summoning of washbasins.",
