    "text": "King of Gods, King of Demons, and their families have moved next door to Tsuchimi Rin, a typical high school student, turning his once peaceful life upside down. The daughters of both kings, Sia and Nerine, are head-over-heels in love with Rin, having met him years ago. Adding to the chaos is Rin's childhood friend Kaede, who is secretly hoping for a romantic relationship with him. As Rin navigates his new reality, he must manage the affections of these three girls while also dealing with the integration of humans, gods, and demons in the mortal world. With a growing harem and the pressures of high school, Rin's life is anything but ordinary. Based on the eroge by Navel, this anime promises a thrilling ride filled with romance, comedy, and the supernatural.",
