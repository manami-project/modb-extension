  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There are three worlds that have recently become connected - the human world, the demon world, and the god world. Beings from the god and demon realms have started migrating to the human world and attempting to live together peacefully. The story centers around Rin Tsuchimi, a normal high school boy living an ordinary life, until one day the royal families of both the demon and god worlds move in next door to him. It turns out that the demon king's daughter Nerine and the god king's daughter Sia had both met and fallen in love with Rin years ago during a brief visit to the human world. Now they have returned and are vying for his affections much to his bewilderment, as he does not remember meeting them before. In addition, Rin's childhood friend Kaede, who he lives with, secretly harbors feelings for him as well. Other girls too, including upperclassmen Asa and a quiet girl named Primula, end up developing crushes on Rin resulting in him dealing with the affection and attention of all these different girls now surrounding him.",
