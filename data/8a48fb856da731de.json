    "text": "Tomino's legendary tale of fantasy and romance unfolds as two worlds collide amidst the chaos of war. Aesap Suzuki, a half-Japanese son of an American military officer, finds himself in a whirlwind of trouble when his radical friends attack a US Army base. As he flees from the authorities, a mysterious battleship emerges from the sea, soaring through the air and revealing a magical realm known as Byston Well. Aboard the ship, Princess Ryukus, the daughter of King Sakomizu, who shares Aesap's Japanese heritage, stands before him with the enchanted Wings of Rean. Desperate for his help, she calls upon Aesap to become the holy warrior in a battle for their intertwined worlds, leading him on an epic journey that will determine the fate of both realms.",
