  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After dying heroically in battle, a proud knight finds his soul reborn into an unlikely new body - that of a tiny behemoth cub. Though behemoths are among the land's most fearsome monsters, our hero is dismayed to realize his new form resembles an adorable pet cat more than a legendary warrior. Just as he resigns himself to this less-than-dignified fate, he crosses paths with a kindhearted elf adventurer. Smitten by his kitten-like appearance, she takes him in, little realizing that her new furry companion has the heart of a champion. As the pair navigate a world filled with danger and intrigue, an unlikely bond forms between them. Though he yearns to regain his former might and glory, the behemoth-turned-housecat finds a new purpose in protecting his rescuer on her quests. Along the way, he discovers being small and cute has its advantages when battling forces of evil - especially if your elf companion is a powerful mage! With humor and heart, this tale follows an unlikely duo as they learn the true meaning of courage, trust and friendship. Their adventures highlight the potential for good, even redemption, found in the most unassuming souls.",
