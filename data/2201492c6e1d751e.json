    "text": "Although he was once the oldest and strongest dragon, feared even by the gods, Dolan met his end at the hands of a human hero. Reincarnated as a human in a quaint, remote village, Dolan finds solace in the simple pleasures of farming and hunting. This peaceful existence, filled with love and happiness previously unknown to him as a dragon, is disrupted when he encounters a lamia named Celina in a nearby swamp. Celina, part human and part snake, is on a quest to find a mate, but her monstrous appearance makes it difficult for her to connect with humans. Despite their differences, Dolan and Celina form an unlikely bond, only to face various threats from enemies lurking in the shadows. Join Dolan and Celina as they navigate the challenges of their unique friendship in a world where monsters and humans collide.",
