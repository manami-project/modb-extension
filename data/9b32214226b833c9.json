  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Olympus, a utopia born from the ashes of a devastating global war, is now home to humans, cyborgs, and bioroidsâ€”genetically engineered beings devoid of negative emotions. Among its protectors are Deunan, a prodigious young soldier, and Briareos, a seasoned cyborg-soldier renowned for his marksmanship. As members of the elite special forces, E.S.W.A.T., they are dispatched to handle any crisis that threatens Olympus. However, their partnership faces an unexpected challenge with the arrival of Tereus, an advanced bioroid with superior abilities and a striking resemblance to Briareos' former human self. As the trio navigates their complex dynamics, they must also confront a looming terrorist threat that could shatter the peace of Olympus. Will their bond be strong enough to overcome these trials and protect their home? Only time will tell.",
