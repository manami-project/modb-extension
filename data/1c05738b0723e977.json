    "text": "Ganbare! Marine Kid follows the adventures of young Marine, who has been genetically enhanced by his oceanographer father to breathe underwater and swim at incredible speeds. Along with his loyal dolphin friend Whitey, Marine helps his father protect the ocean from harm as part of the Ocean Patrol. In this new series based on the original Dolphin Prince anime, Marine was previously known as the Dolphin Prince while his dolphin friend was called Neptuna. Their names and some other character names were changed for this new iteration, which also expands the world and introduces new characters. Using his special Oxygum to breathe underwater as well as rocket-powered boots to propel himself at high speeds, Marine confronts a variety of threats and mysteries lurking in the ocean depths. With Whitey always ready to assist when needed, Marine strives to keep the sea safe for all marine life. Their underwater adventures are sure to entertain and educate viewers about the wonders and perils of the deep blue sea.",
