  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kiyotaka Ayanokoji enrolls at the prestigious Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School, where nearly all students are guaranteed to enter college or find employment after graduating. However, Ayanokoji ends up in Class 1-D, which contains students with disciplinary issues who struggle academically. The school employs an unorthodox merit-based system, awarding students monthly points worth Â¥100,000 in cash based on academic performance and other achievements. Classes also permit disruptive behavior like sleeping and sabotage during lessons. After a month, Ayanokoji and his classmates discover the cutthroat competition underlying the school's nurturing facade. Among Ayanokoji's classmates are the solitary overachiever Suzune Horikita, who believes she was placed in Class D by mistake, and friendly social butterfly Kikyou Kushida, who aims to befriend as many peers as possible. Although class assignments are permanent, students can improve their rankings by outperforming higher-ranked peers. With no restrictions on their methods, Ayanokoji and his allies must prevail in this ruthless academic system to reach the top of their class.",
