  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in the gritty, high-tech world of Cyberpunk 2077, this music video tells the story of Sasha, an edgerunner scraping by on the streets of Night City. As a member of Maine's gang, Sasha navigates the ruthless criminal underworld, chasing dreams of ascent while struggling against the crushing weight of poverty. The music video brings Cyberpunk 2077's vivid dystopian future to life through stunning visuals directed by renowned artist Ilya Kuvshinov. Dawid Podsiad≈Ço's melancholic track \"Let You Down\" plays in the background, encapsulating Sasha's plight - her hopes and ambitions ultimately giving way to disillusionment. This same song serves as the ending theme to Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, an anime set in the same universe. Gripping and atmospheric, the video provides a window into the cyberpunk world, following one girl's desperate fight for survival on the edge of society's blade. Like the anime it accompanies, this dynamic visual feast tempers frenetic action with somber reflection, promising an experience that resonates emotionally as much as visually.",
