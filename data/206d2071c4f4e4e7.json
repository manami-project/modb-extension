  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuushi Inaba's life is upended when he loses his parents at a young age and is forced to move in with relatives. Though cared for, he feels like a burden. His hope to gain independence by living in a high school dormitory is dashed when it burns down before he can move in. As a budget-strapped orphaned student, finding affordable housing proves extremely difficult, until Yuushi discovers a suspiciously cheap apartment in an old building called Kotobuki Manor. He soon realizes why the rent is so low - the manor is home to a hodgepodge of ghosts, supernatural creatures, and humans living side-by-side. From a ghostly boy wandering the halls with his dog, to an invisible cook identifiable only by her floating hands, Yuushi's new neighbors are far from normal. Despite the bizarre and eerie situation, the human residents of Kotobuki Manor seem nonplussed by their unearthly neighbors. And as Yuushi adjusts to this strange new life in the monster apartment, his once closed-off heart gradually opens to the possibilities of friendship and community with both human and non-human. What at first seemed a disaster might turn out to be exactly what Yuushi needs to build connections and plant roots after years adrift from loss.",
