    "text": "Saving spirits and guiding them to tranquility is the everyday grind for Rinne Rokudo, a half-Shinigami, half-human entity. But when enigmatic spirits from the afterlife start causing chaos in his world, the burden becomes too much for Rinne and his level-headed companion, Sakura Mamiya. As new faces enter the scene, including a new teacher, a fellow Shinigami girl, and a plethora of restless spirits with unresolved matters, Rinne's life spirals into a whirlwind of supernatural encounters. Amidst the chaos, a scythe-wielding girl emerges, hinting at the possibility of unveiling the secrets of Rinne's past. Brace yourself for a thrilling ride as Rinne and his friends navigate the complexities of the spirit world while attempting to maintain a semblance of normalcy in their own lives.",
