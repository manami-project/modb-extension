    "text": "After two years of intense training, the Straw Hat Pirates finally reunite and head into the treacherous New World, where Luffy reencounters Trafalgar Law. Together, they form an alliance against one of the Four Emperors. Meanwhile, Sabo, Luffy's childhood friend who was presumed dead, is revealed to be alive and a high-ranking member of the Revolutionary Army. Under orders, Sabo infiltrates Dressrosa, ruled by the notorious Warlord Donquixote Doflamingo, to investigate its weapons trade. When Sabo discovers his brother Luffy has arrived in Dressrosa to take down Doflamingo, he is conflicted on whether to reveal himself. Though they failed to rescue their sworn brother Ace in the past, Sabo hopes to protect Luffy this time. An opportunity arises when Doflamingo announces a grand battle tournament with Ace's Flame-Flame Fruit as the prize. Teaming up incognito, the brothers enter the contest seeking to reclaim Ace's power and finish what they started by defeating Doflamingo.",
