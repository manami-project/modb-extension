  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Flamingo's tyranny in Dressrosa sets the stage for a covert unit of the Revolutionary Army, led by Sabo, to infiltrate the kingdom and put an end to the nefarious arms dealings. Unbeknownst to many, Sabo shares a deep bond with Luffy and Ace, as the three of them harbored dreams of becoming pirates during their childhood.\n\nIn the New World, the Straw Hat Pirates, after two years of rigorous training, find themselves on Punk Hazard Island, where they cross paths with Trafalgar Law and forge an alliance against the Four Warlords. Little does Luffy know that he's about to come face-to-face with a friend he once believed to be dead.\n\nAs Sabo grapples with the guilt of not being able to save Ace, he discovers that Luffy and the Straw Hat Pirates are heading to Dressrosa to confront Flamingo. Sabo is torn between his allegiance to the Revolutionary Army and his brotherly bond with Luffy.\n\nWith the Colosseum's grand prize being none other than Ace's Flame-Flame Fruit, Sabo and Luffy, united by their shared past and the promises they made with Ace, decide to fight in disguise. As they tread this dangerous path, they must confront their enemies and their own inner demons to protect what truly matters.",
