  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zero, a mysterious entity, haunts the digitally controlled city of Tom Sawyer, causing chaos by erasing citizens' 'Love,' the social currency akin to likes on social media. In this augmented reality, citizens exchange Love for public services and avatars via the Decoration Customizer (Deco), a hologram device implanted in their eyes. Berry, an ordinary girl, becomes fascinated by Zero and meets Hack, a girl who appears as a boy, when her Deco malfunctions. Hack leads the Ghost Detectives Club, a group of \"socially dead\" individuals who work invisibly within Tom Sawyer. As Berry joins the club, she learns about Zero's underground activities and begins to uncover the hidden truth behind the seemingly peaceful city. With the help of the Ghost Detectives Club, Berry embarks on a journey to unravel the secrets of Tom Sawyer and the enigmatic figure known as Zero.",
