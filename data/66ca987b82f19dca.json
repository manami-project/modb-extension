    "text": "Girl named Aya Asagiri finds herself trapped in an endless cycle of torment, bullied mercilessly at school and subjected to physical abuse at the hands of her own brother. With her life seemingly devoid of hope, a strange website, \"Mahou Shoujo Site,\" appears on her computer screen, offering her a chance at magical powers. Initially dismissing it as a twisted joke, Aya soon discovers a magical staff hidden in her locker, which she reluctantly decides to use against her tormentors. However, the consequences of her actions are far more severe than she ever imagined.\n\nAs Aya grapples with the guilt of inadvertently causing the death of her classmates, she encounters Tsuyuno Yatsumura, another magical girl with the power to stop time. Together, they must navigate a treacherous world of magic and darkness, battling against other magical girls while attempting to uncover the truth behind the enigmatic website and an impending apocalyptic event known as 'The Tempest.' In this desperate struggle for survival, Aya and her newfound allies will discover the true purpose of the Magical Girl Site and the sinister intentions that lie beneath its surface.",
