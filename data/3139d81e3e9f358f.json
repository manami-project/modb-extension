  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the magical world of Aldarake, tensions run high between humans, demihumans like the rabbit-eared Frau, and the demonic oni. Princess Saltorine \"Sally\" Aldike lives a sheltered life in her countryside castle, unaware of the discrimination faced by demihumans or the oni's dangerous powers. Her life changes when a group of vicious oni invades the kingdom, only to be defeated by a lone swordsman named Mikoto Kibitsu. Mikoto wields tremendous power from his \"Peach Eye,\" allowing him to easily slay the oni. While Sally is grateful, she is disturbed by Mikoto's brutal methods. She realizes how little she knows about the threats beyond her walls. Longing to see the world and pursue the mysterious Mikoto, Sally leaves the castle behind. On her journey, she befriends the mistreated Frau and saves a village, hoping to prove that peace is possible between the races. But Mikoto, known as the ruthless \"Momotaro,\" shares no such belief. Though they possess the same strange power, he is determined to annihilate every last oni. As Sally and Mikoto's paths intertwine, the future of coexistence hangs in the balance. Will Sally cling to her optimistic ideals? Or will Mikoto's merciless approach prevail and spell doom for the oni? The two wield the power to decide the fate of the magical world.",
