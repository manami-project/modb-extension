    "text": "The story follows Sorata Kanda, a second-year high school student with a soft spot for stray cats, leading him to be exiled to Sakurasou, a dormitory for the school's most eccentric and problematic students. Despite the initial hardships, Sorata discovers that each of his fellow residents possesses remarkable talents. The arrival of Mashiro Shiina, a world-class artist with severe self-care issues, captivates Sorata, and he takes on the responsibility of looking after her.\n\nAs Sorata navigates through the chaotic and unpredictable environment of Sakurasou, he forms unique bonds with his fellow residents, including Misaki, an energetic animator; Jin, a playwright playboy; Ryuunosuke, a reclusive programmer; and Chihiro, the dorm manager and art teacher. With his initial goal of returning to normal housing fading, Sorata finds himself growing closer to Mashiro and becoming increasingly involved in the lives of the extraordinary individuals surrounding him.\n\nIn this heartwarming coming-of-age tale, Sakurasou no Pet na Kanojo explores the intricate connections between talent, hard work, romance, and friendship, as Sorata and Mashiro support each other in their respective endeavors. Alongside their eccentric companions, they learn to embrace their quirks and strive to become equals among the talented residents of Sakurasou.",
