    "text": "Darkness looms as the ordinary life of Kurumi Azuchimomoyama, a 14-year-old student at Egaogaoka Middle School, takes a dramatic turn. An otherworldly entity, Devilun, resembling a Tasmanian devil, descends upon her, bestowing the formidable powers of a magical girl dinosaur angel warrior, Prima Angel. Tasked with battling the nefarious 'Darkness Whales' organization, Kurumi fearlessly wields her blood-tinged weapons, leaving no mercy for her adversaries. Meanwhile, her three male classmates, mere bystanders, watch the spectacle unfold, contributing little to the unfolding saga.",
