    "text": "The anime \"Breakers\" follows the journey of four young para-athletes as they discover their true potential under the guidance of an unconventional sports scientist, Ren Narita. The series explores four unique sports: wheelchair basketball, high jump, goalball, and paralympic swimming.\n\nUmi, a young boy with a prosthetic leg, dreams of following in his brother's footsteps and becoming a basketball player. Ren recognizes Umi's natural talent for throwing and introduces him to the challenging world of wheelchair basketball. Meanwhile, Katsu, a former handball ace, finds new hope in high jump after losing his leg in an accident.\n\nIn another story, Ren is tasked with coaching a goalball team, but struggles to find enough players. Emi, a girl with normal vision, is recruited as the team's manager, but unexpectedly finds herself playing blindfolded in a crucial game.\n\nTaku, a boy with a partial left forearm, enjoys swimming but has no interest in competitions. However, when Ren recognizes his talent, Taku is introduced to the world of paralympic swimming and must face fierce competition to stay motivated.\n\nAs the para-athletes push past their limits and unlock their potential, they learn valuable lessons about perseverance, teamwork, and the true meaning of sportsmanship.",
