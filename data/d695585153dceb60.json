    "text": "One time, witches were revered as divine beings who guided humanity towards prosperity with their magical abilities. However, the rapid advancement of science and technology led to the decline of magic, and witches were branded as threats to civilization by the powerful Redia Empire. This sparked a brutal witch hunt, and those who managed to escape lived in constant fear of being discovered.\n\nAdonis, a human, was taken in and raised by a kind-hearted witch named Chloe. They lived a peaceful life in seclusion, but their happiness was short-lived. When Chloe's identity was revealed, she was captured and executed by the empire, leaving Adonis devastated and filled with rage.\n\nConsumed by hatred towards humanity, Adonis vows to avenge his beloved mentor and embarks on a dark path of vengeance. With the magic bestowed upon him by Chloe, he seeks to destroy the very civilization that caused her demise. Will Adonis succeed in his quest for revenge, or will he become another casualty in the brutal war between magic and science?",
