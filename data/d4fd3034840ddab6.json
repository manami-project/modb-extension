    "text": "In the world of \"Big Order OVA\", the age-old adage \"be careful what you wish for\" takes on a whole new meaning. The narrative revolves around Eiji Hoshimiya, a reserved high school student harboring a colossal secret. A decade ago, he made a wish for the world's annihilation, a wish that was granted by enigmatic beings known as fairies. These fairies bestow unique abilities called Orders upon select individuals, with the nature of these powers hinging on the individual's deepest desires. Now, in the aftermath of the Great Destruction, Eiji grapples with the magnitude of his power and the potential guilt that accompanies it. As he navigates through life with these formidable abilities, he finds himself unsure of how to handle them, setting the stage for a compelling tale of power, responsibility, and personal growth.",
