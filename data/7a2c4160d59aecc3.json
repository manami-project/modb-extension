    "text": "Shiraki gym's once-promising boxer, Joe Yabuki, finds himself on a soul-searching journey after an unfortunate incident in the ring leaves him responsible for his opponent's death. Haunted by the tragic event, Joe's confidence and determination plummet, leading him to abandon the world of boxing.\n\nDuring his travels, he crosses paths with several influential figures, including Wolf Kanagushi and Goromaki Gondo, who unwittingly rekindle Joe's passion for the sport. With renewed vigor, he decides to face his past and return to the ring, but an unexpected hesitation hinders his progress.\n\nTo help Joe overcome his newfound weakness, the gym's members invite Carlos Rivera, a world-famous boxer who shares a similar background, to train with him. As Joe confronts his inner demons and learns from Rivera, he embarks on a journey of redemption and self-discovery, striving to regain his former glory and become a champion once more.",
