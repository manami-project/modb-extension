  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the frozen tundra, a mysterious immortal being called \"It\" appears as an orb. Gaining the abilities to morph into things it encounters and regenerate when injured, It slowly gains consciousness and identity. First taking the form of stone, then moss, It transforms into a dying wolf and feels sensation for the first time. Wandering alone, It meets a lonely boy awaiting the return of his departed tribe. Identifying with the boy's isolation, It takes his form as well. Now called Fushi, the immortal being joins the boy on a quest to find the rumored paradise his tribe sought. Fushi yearns to understand his purpose on this journey of hardship and self-discovery. Guided by the boy and the connections they form with others, Fushi confronts the destructive Nokkers that threaten humanity while learning the meaning of friendship, loyalty, and loss. Over time, Fushi evolves from a blank slate into a complex person who chooses to protect the world he is still struggling to comprehend.",
