  "synopsis": {
    "text": "O-part, a mysterious device believed to bestow immortality, has been the center of Inaho's fascination since her childhood, thanks to her grandmother's tales. As she steps into adulthood, Inaho embarks on a quest to find this elusive artifact, hoping to attain eternal life just like her grandmother. Accompanying her is Mosquiton, a quarter-vampire who, after being revived by Inaho's blood, pledges his servitude and love to her.\n\nIn the roaring 1920s, their pursuit of the O-part is fraught with danger as they are not the only ones seeking its power. Mosquiton, despite his pacifist nature and fondness for women's blood, often finds himself protecting Inaho from various supernatural threats. Joined by Mosquiton's ex-wife and two companions, they navigate through these perils, with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. Will Inaho's dream of immortality come true, or will the world crumble before they find the O-part?",
