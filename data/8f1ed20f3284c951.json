    "text": "Shikizakura is a mystical place where cherry blossoms and autumn leaves adorn the trees at the same time, representing the intersection of the transient, physical world and the timeless spirit world. Here, a prophecy states that the shrine maiden Ouka Myoujin will perform a ritual to save humanity. When high school student Kakeru Miwa accidentally activates an ancient suit of mystical armor called Yoroi, he finds himself caught up in Ouka's story. The Yoroi suit enables Kakeru to battle demonic creatures called Oni that are possessing humans and threatening the world. He joins a team tasked with protecting Ouka on her dangerous journey to Shikizakura. Kakeru embraces his new role and is determined to become a hero. But the road ahead is filled with peril, as malevolent forces seek to prevent the ritual from occurring. Past and future, thoughts and wishes all converge in this realm between worlds, where the fate of humanity hangs in the balance. Will Kakeru and his allies succeed in defending Ouka so she can fulfill her destiny? The battle for humanity's future begins as this unlikely hero takes up the fight.",
