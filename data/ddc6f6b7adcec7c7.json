  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story takes place in the futuristic city of Heartland and follows Yuma Tsukumo, an amateur duelist aiming to become the world's greatest Duel Monsters champion. During a duel with a school bully named Ryoga \"Shark\" Kamishiro, Yuma's treasured key splits into two. As Yuma struggles, a mysterious spirit named Astral appears and helps Yuma win. Astral explains he's lost his memories, which have been transformed into 99 powerful \"Numbers\" cards now scattered worldwide. The Numbers can possess duelists and unleash their darkest desires. To regain his memories, Astral teams up with the reluctant Yuma to hunt the Numbers. However, they soon realize other duelists with sinister motives are also seeking these cards. Armed with his self-repairing key, Yuma opens the mystical \"Door of Destiny\" and agrees to help Astral recover the Numbers cards. Though divine intervention aids them initially, the pair must ultimately rely on their own skills to defend Heartland from impending threats and collect the Numbers before they fall into the wrong hands.",
