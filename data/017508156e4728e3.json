  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This Japanese animated film brings a beloved nursery rhyme to life through whimsical animation. As rain falls on a mountainside, it forms a gurgling stream where a curious bear stops to peer at his reflection. The bear wonders if any fish inhabit these burbling waters that were created from the dancing raindrops. The film is part of the \"Songs of Japan\" project which aims to preserve traditional Japanese children's songs by creating new animated interpretations to engage modern audiences. By revitalizing this classic rhyme about a mischievous bear and the rain on the mountain, the filmmakers hope to keep it alive for future generations. Their rendition adds vivid visuals to complement the playful lyrics. With its lush scenery and playful protagonist, this short film promises to delight young and old viewers alike while introducing them to an iconic piece of Japanese culture. Its beautiful style and universal theme give fresh resonance to the simple joys of a rainy day.",
