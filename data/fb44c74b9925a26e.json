    "text": "Only two individuals stand aware of the impending doom hurtling through the cosmos, an ancient entity known as Genma, who has decimated half of the universe and now sets his sights on Earth. Princess Luna, a contemporary seer, and Vega, a cybernetic warrior hailing from a world already devastated by Genma, join forces to safeguard Earth from a similar destiny. In a race against time, they must rally the most formidable psychics on Earth to form an army capable of halting the unstoppable force that has claimed countless lives. As Genma's minions infiltrate Earth to thwart any resistance, the question remains: Can Luna and Vega unite their champions before it's too late?
