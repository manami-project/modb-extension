    "text": "It has been seven years since the horrific Raccoon City incident, where the deadly T-Virus turned people into bloodthirsty zombies. The shady Umbrella Corporation responsible for the outbreak collapsed. Now, zombies suddenly appear at an American airport, threatening a new outbreak. Claire Redfield and Leon S. Kennedy, hardened zombie fighters who survived Raccoon City, race to the airport. A rogue warrior seeks revenge for his familyâ€™s death in Raccoon City by unleashing the mutated G-Virus monster. Meanwhile, the rising pharmaceutical company WilPharma aims to create a zombie vaccine, but they too get ensnared in the chaos. Claire and Leon must combine their skills and experience to terminate the outbreak before the zombies spread globally. But dangerous foes with sinister agendas lurk in the shadows. Our heroes must uncover the truth behind this latest zombie attack before history repeats itself.",
