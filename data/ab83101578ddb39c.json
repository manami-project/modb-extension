    "text": "Ginko, a seasoned Mushi-shi, is summoned to a rural village that has been plunged into perpetual darkness following a solar eclipse. As the villagers watch in awe, the sun refuses to shine, leaving their crops at risk of withering away. The peculiar occurrence appears to be linked to a mysterious Mushi known as Hihami, which is rumored to cause unending eclipses.\n\nTanyuu Karibusa, a cursed recorder, had predicted the arrival of the Hihami, prompting Ginko to investigate the village. As he delves deeper into the mystery, he discovers that the strange phenomenon may be connected to a pair of enigmatic twin girls residing nearby. However, not all the villagers are eager to see the light of day return, as one of them seems to be benefiting from the calamity.\n\nWith time running out, Ginko must unravel the secret behind the Hihami and restore the sun to the village before it's too late. Will he be able to save the village from the clutches of darkness, or will they remain trapped in the shadow of the Mushi forever? Only time will tell.",
