    "text": "Yuuki Saya, Campbell Erica, and Minaguchi Tomo, three ordinary high school girls, find themselves in the midst of an extraordinary opportunity to become members of the newly reformed Lemon Angel, a legendary girl band that once dominated the Japanese music scene. A year ago, the original band members vanished without a trace, leaving behind a legacy of chart-topping hits and a loyal fanbase.\n\nTomo, a close friend of the late Yui Kono, Lemon Angel's original songwriter, is approached by music producer Ryuuta Kogure to audition for the new group. With a desire to fulfill Yui's wish and keep her memory alive, Tomo agrees to take on the challenge. However, the competition is fierce, and the road to stardom is filled with obstacles and rivalries.\n\nAs the auditions progress, Tomo, Saya, and Erica must prove their worth against other talented hopefuls, including Miki Suwa, the only remaining member of the original Lemon Angel. Will they have what it takes to become the next generation of Lemon Angel, or will the mystery surrounding the band's past be too much to overcome? Only time will tell if these young women can rise to the occasion and make their dreams come true.",
