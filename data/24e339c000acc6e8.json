  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shinko, a lively third-grader with a vivid imagination and a distinctive curl on her forehead, resides in Kokuga, a quaint rural town in 1955 post-war Japan. Once a thriving regional capital during the Feudal Era, Kokuga still holds remnants of the Heian Period, which Shinko frequently envisions herself in. Her daydreams revolve around a secluded princess from a millennium ago, providing a delightful escape from her daily life.\n\nOne day, Kiiko, a reserved girl from Tokyo, joins Shinko's class as her father has moved to the town to work as a factory doctor. Initially, Kiiko struggles to adapt to the slower pace of the small town, but she soon forms a deep bond with Shinko. Together, they embark on a series of adventures, from caring for a goldfish in a makeshift pond to helping a boy cope with a family tragedy.\n\nAs their friendship blossoms, the girls find themselves entangled in a peculiar incident that seems to have roots in the distant past. Through their shared experiences and vivid imaginations, Shinko and Kiiko create a captivating world that bridges the past and present, offering a heartwarming tale of friendship and adventure.",
