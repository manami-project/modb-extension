  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's a celebration of the Millennium Comet's return, and the festive atmosphere is palpable as Ash, May, Brock, and Max arrive at the vibrant Forina valley. Amidst the excitement, they encounter the mythical Jirachi, a Pokémon that awakens once every thousand years to absorb the comet's energy and nourish the surrounding landscape. The young Pokémon quickly forms a bond with Max, but their friendship is threatened by a former Team Magma member, Butler, who seeks to harness Jirachi's power for his own selfish desires.\n\nButler, a skilled magician, aims to revive the ancient Pokémon Groudon, unaware of the chaos that lies within Jirachi's abilities. As the group of friends tries to protect Jirachi, Butler's plan goes awry, and a false Groudon emerges, wreaking havoc on Forina and draining the life force of all nearby creatures. With the once-flourishing valley now a barren wasteland, it falls upon Ash, May, Brock, Max, and their newfound friend Jirachi to put an end to the destruction and restore Forina's natural beauty before it's too late.",
