    "text": "Hongo Yui and Yuuki Miaka, two inseparable best friends, stumble upon an ancient book, \"The Universe of the Four Gods,\" at their local library, only to be magically transported into its mystical world. Miaka finds herself thrust into the role of the Priestess of Suzaku, destined to save the war-torn land of Kounan by gathering the seven Celestial Warriors. Meanwhile, Yui is unwillingly cast as the Priestess of Seiryuu, serving the neighboring kingdom of Kutou under the manipulative Nakago's influence.\n\nAs the two friends become bitter rivals, Miaka forms a newfound family with the Celestial Warriors and discovers the love of her life, Tamahome. The stage is set for an emotional journey filled with love, betrayal, and heartache as the former best friends race against time to summon their respective gods and fulfill their wishes. In this enchanting tale, friendships are tested, and hope never fades, as the lines between reality and fiction blur in the quest for ultimate power.",
