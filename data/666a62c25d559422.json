    "text": "Saki Watase is a 26-year-old office worker struggling to make ends meet. In an effort to earn some extra cash, she signs up for a product testing program. However, the first product she receives is a huge box of XL condoms. Embarrassed, Saki puts the task aside. Later, while out drinking with coworkers, Saki has too much to drink. Her boss, Keisuke Sudou, offers to take her home. Upon arriving at her apartment, Keisuke notices Saki's stash of XL condoms. When Saki explains that she signed up to test the products, Keisuke reveals that he is XL-sized and offers to assist with the testing. Thus begins an unexpected romance between Saki and her boss. Though initially participating just to complete her product testing assignment, Saki starts to develop real feelings for Keisuke. At the same time, a new XL-sized coworker, Riku, enters the picture. This sets up a complicated XL love triangle within the office. Ultimately, \"XL Boss\" is a fun and flirty romantic comedy. Centered around an awkward situation, it explores the humorous misunderstandings and growing relationships between three XL-sized characters. With lighthearted moments and steamy encounters, the anime promises an entertaining viewing experience.",
