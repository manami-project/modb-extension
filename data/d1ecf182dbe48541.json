  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During the late 1980s, Jotaro Kujo, a rebellious 17-year-old, finds himself incarcerated in a Japanese prison, convinced that an evil spirit has taken over him. When his grandfather, Joseph Joestar, a seasoned fighter against supernatural forces, visits him, he reveals that the 'evil spirit' is actually a 'Stand,' a physical manifestation of one's life energy and psyche that grants extraordinary abilities. The sudden emergence of these Stands is linked to the resurrection of DIO, an immortal vampire and the Joestar family's arch-nemesis, whose awakening has triggered the manifestation of Stands in the Joestar bloodline.\n\nTo save his mother, whose uncontrollable Stand threatens her life, Jotaro, Joseph, and their allies embark on a perilous journey to Egypt, DIO's current residence. Along the way, they must confront and defeat a myriad of powerful Stand users who are determined to stop them. The fate of humanity hangs in the balance as Jotaro and his allies race against time to defeat DIO and prevent his plans for world domination.",
