  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Being stranded in the vast expanse of space, a research team aboard an advanced space station intercepts a derelict vessel, the 'Green Planet', that materializes in their vicinity. The crew stumbles upon Buzz, the ship's commander and lone survivor, who is unable to communicate the horrors that transpired on his ship. As they delve deeper into the mystery, the researchers uncover a sinister force that has wiped out the entire crew of the 'Green Planet'.\n\nIn this chilling tale inspired by the iconic 1979 film Alien, the research station becomes a temporary haven for a spaceship riddled with death and despair. Plagued by nightmarish visions of her crewmates' grisly demise, Moira, a young woman aboard the station, soon realizes that the horrors are not confined to her dreams alone. A malevolent extraterrestrial entity has infiltrated their sanctuary, feeding on their deepest fears and regrets.\n\nAs the alien entity begins to pick off the crew members one by one, tensions escalate, and the remaining survivors must confront their darkest fears and unite to outwit the otherworldly predator. With time running out and the body count rising, will any of them survive long enough to escape the clutches of this terrifying nemesis?",
