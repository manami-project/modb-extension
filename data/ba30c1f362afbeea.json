    "text": "So close, yet so far, Chizuru and Yuudai find themselves in a delicate dance of love and uncertainty. Both harbor deep feelings for each other, but fear and past heartaches keep them from expressing their true emotions. As their relationship stagnates and the chasm between them widens, Chizuru believes the end is near. Meanwhile, Yuudai grapples with his timid nature, determined to confess his love before it's too late. Amidst the chaos of a Christmas gone awry and a mini donkey on the loose, the couple finds themselves separated, each reflecting on their relationship from their own unique perspectives. Will love prevail, or will their inability to meet halfway lead to a heartbreaking conclusion? Join Chizuru and Yuudai in this tender, two-sided love story that explores the importance of communication and the courage it takes to open one's heart.",
