  "synopsis": {
    "text": "News of a delightful animated musical short has emerged, crafted to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the esteemed Japanese confectionery company, Lotte. The short film is beautifully accompanied by the song 'Shinsekai' (New World) performed by the renowned band Bump of Chicken.\n\nAt the heart of this charming tale is an encounter between a reserved middle school boy and an effervescent high school girl. Their paths cross in a Lotte shop, where they both reach for the same chocolate bar. In a spontaneous change of heart, the girl opts for a different treat, leaving the boy to ponder the missed connection.\n\nIntriguingly, the pair's interactions are not limited to the human realm. They are surrounded by an array of whimsical characters, each representing the 'spirits' of various Lotte snacks. Among these are a dapper men's singing group, embodying the essence of Ghana chocolate bars, and a delightful troupe of Koalas, symbolizing the beloved Koala March treats.\n\nWith a newfound resolve, the boy hopes for another chance encounter with the girl. If fortune favors him, he plans to present her with the chocolate bar she initially desired, along with a confession of his burgeoning feelings. This delightful blend of romance, whimsy, and confectionery magic promises a unique and engaging viewing experience.",
