    "text": "Utonium, a professor, and his assistant son, Ken, stumble upon a new chemical substance, Chemical Z, during an experiment involving the mysterious Chemical X and an unexpected rice cake. The discovery coincides with the sudden appearance of a massive iceberg off the coast of Tokyo City. In an attempt to destroy the iceberg, Ken fires a Chemical Z ray at it, resulting in an explosion of black and white lights that scatter across the city.\n\nThree unsuspecting junior high school girls, Momoko, Miyako, and Kaoru, find themselves bathed in the white light, granting them extraordinary powers. They become the Powerpuff Girls Z, tasked with defending Tokyo City from the evil forces unleashed by the black light, including the transformed zoo monkey, Mojo Jojo.\n\nAs the Powerpuff Girls Z, the trio must balance their high school lives with their superhero duties, all while dealing with the various villains threatening their city. Based on the beloved American cartoon, this anime adaptation offers a fresh take on the origin story of the Powerpuff Girls, delving deeper into the creation of both heroes and villains.",
