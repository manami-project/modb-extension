    "text": "Eight years have passed since a tragic car accident claimed the lives of their parents, leaving the young Gu Chi and Jiang Lan orphaned. In an act of compassion, Jiang Lan adopted Gu Chi, becoming a beacon of hope in his otherwise bleak world. As the years went by, Gu Chi, now a budding model, found himself falling in love with his adoptive sister, a successful supermodel.\n\nAs their professional lives intertwine, the dynamics of their relationship begin to shift. Despite the age gap and the fear of disrupting their bond, Gu Chi yearns for more than just a sibling connection. He wonders if their relationship could have taken a different course if their first encounter had been under different circumstances.\n\nNow, Gu Chi is on a mission to express his feelings and prove to Jiang Lan that he can be her lifelong protector. Will the domineering Jiang Lan see her 'brother' in a new light, or will the age gap and their sibling-like relationship prove to be insurmountable obstacles? Only time will tell in this heartwarming tale of love, family, and self-discovery.",
