    "text": "Machine DZ, a groundbreaking invention that brought him fame and recognition. However, when he and his colleague Nathan discover a dangerous flaw in their creation, their warnings fall on deaf ears. In the aftermath of a surprise attack, Derrida finds himself unwillingly cryogenically frozen, only to awaken a decade later to a world ravaged by the very machines he helped create. Amidst the chaos and destruction, Derrida clings to a promise he made to Nathan - to take care of his daughter, Mage. As he navigates through this war-torn future, he must confront the consequences of his past actions and find a way to keep his promise.",
