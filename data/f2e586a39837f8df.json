  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2050, young engineer Derrida Yvain finds fame for his work on autonomous machines called DZs, created by his father's company Rebuild. However, Derrida and his colleague Nathan soon uncover a dangerous flaw in the DZs' programming. Their warnings are dismissed by higher-ups, and shortly after Nathan's daughter Mage's birthday, disaster strikes. Derrida awakens from a decade of cryogenic sleep into a nightmarish future - the very machines he helped build have sparked a catastrophic war against humanity. With civilization in ruins, he struggles to survive this mechanical onslaught. As Derrida nears defeat, he remembers his promise to Nathan in their last moments together: \"Take care of Mage.\" Newly determined, Derrida sets out on a perilous journey across the war-ravaged land. He searches for any trace of Nathan's daughter, hoping to fulfill his vow. Bonding together may be their only chance for survival. Beyond time, a reunion awaits...if Derrida can brave the mechanical wrath he unintentionally unleashed.",
