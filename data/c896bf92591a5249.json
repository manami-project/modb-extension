  "synopsis": {
    "text": "What awaits the Magical Girls as they continue their relentless battle against the Uwasa of the Soldier Bear and the Amane sisters, all while trying to reach Iroha? As Iroha and Touka struggle to regain the memories that Nemu's power stole from them, the girls around Iroha must fight to free Tsuruno and Mami from the control of the Uwasa. Meanwhile, Touka and Nemu's plan to concentrate all the witches seems to have been foiled, but they remain determined to complete their research and put an end to the witches' threats once and for all.\n\nAs the battle in Kamihama City rages on, the Wings of Magius grow closer to executing their plan to awaken Embryo Eve, an artificial being that can allegedly liberate magical girls from their destinies. With Walpurgis Night changing course for Mitakihara City, Iroha Tamaki's last chance to stop the organization is quickly fading. But as lingering hope for a better future invigorates her final endeavor, Iroha uncovers memories of a story that has been tampered with by fate. Will the Magical Girls be able to prevent the worst from happening, or will they succumb to the cruel fate that awaits them? Only time will tell.",
