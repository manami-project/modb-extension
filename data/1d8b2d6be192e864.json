    "text": "Liu Siwen is deeply in love with Ou Yang, but faces opposition from her martial arts master father who refuses to let them marry. To gain his approval, Siwen must defeat the father in an honest duel, something he has attempted and failed at many times due to his poor fighting skills. In desperation, Siwen seeks the help of Lu Guang and Cheng Xiaoshi, partners with complementary abilities who run the Time Photo Studio. Using their supernatural power to enter photographs and alter the past, they hatch a clever plan to help Siwen finally impress Ou Yang's father. However, outwitting the protective master and gaining his blessing proves more difficult than expected. This special episode chronicles whether the Time Photo Studio can successfully unite the star-crossed lovers, or if Siwen and Ou Yang's future remains doomed by the father's prohibition.",
