They are approached by Liu Siwen, a man desperate to marry his beloved Ouyang. However, there's a catch. Ouyang's father, a formidable martial arts master, is skeptical of outsiders and will only bless the union if Siwen can defeat him in combat.

Using their unique ability to enter photographs and travel into the past, the duo devises a strategy to decipher the master's distinct martial arts techniques. Will they succeed in their mission and help Siwen win his future father-in-law's approval? Tune in to find out!",
