Throughout their journey, the Norn's passengers begin to realize there may be more to their abilities and mission than meets the eye. As tensions and suspicions rise amongst the group, they find themselves attacked by an outside force aiming to stop them. Together Sorata and the eclectic Norn crew must try to uncover the truth behind their powers, their journey to The World, and the emerging threats they face.
