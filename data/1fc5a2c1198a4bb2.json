  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yashiro, a yakuza boss, has his sights set on recruiting Eishin Kuga, a street punk known as \"Mad Dog\" for his explosive temper. However, Kuga stubbornly refuses to join the yakuza, unwilling to let others dictate his life. After a violent altercation, Kuga sustains injuries and finds himself under the care of Kanji Kageyama, an underground doctor who treats members of Yashiro's group. As the aloof Kageyama interacts with the brash Kuga during his recovery, an unlikely relationship slowly develops between the two starkly contrasting men. Kuga remains indebted to Yashiro while resisting his continued recruitment attempts. Yet his growing bond with Kageyama leads him to reconsider his lone wolf lifestyle. Ultimately, Kuga faces a crossroads - whether to give in to Yashiro's demands or chart a new path guided by an improbable connection with the very doctor who treated his wounds.",
