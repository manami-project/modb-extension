    "text": "Koji Tajima leads Hato Industries, a small, financially-strapped company specializing in pest control, in a near-future world where humans are plagued by enigmatic creatures known as \"Kyoju.\" Enter Tetsuro Okino, a young engineer with a vision, who joins the team with his cutting-edge robot, Bullbuster, designed to combat these mysterious beings. As the group grapples with the complexities of operating the expensive robot and the constant pressure to conserve resources, a clash between Tetsuro's idealism and Koji's pragmatism looms. Can Hato Industries find a balance between their mission to exterminate the Kyoju and the harsh economic realities they face, or will their internal struggles leave humanity at the mercy of these formidable creatures?",
