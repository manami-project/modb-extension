  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This introspective anime follows a man on an ordinary walk through the park, observing the subtle details of the world around him. As he strolls, various sights catch his eye - a man reading a newspaper, a statue of a kangaroo, tiny flowers poking through the grass. These observations lodge themselves in the corners of his mind, changing shape and becoming truncated as memories do. The animation prompts the viewer to contemplate how we process the constant stream of sensory information that bombards us daily, both consciously and unconsciously. What imprints itself? What fades away? How are memories constructed from the endless parade of mundane moments in a life? Through quiet, poetic imagery, this work invites us to join the protagonist on his thoughtful meander through the familiar made strange. Subtly yet profoundly, it illuminates the artistry in the commonplace.",
