  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokyo University of the Arts presents a thought-provoking exploration of memory and perception in this 2010 graduate work from the Department of Animation. The story follows an ordinary day in the life of a collector as he takes a leisurely stroll through a park. Along the way, he encounters various sights - a man engrossed in a newspaper, a kangaroo statue, and delicate flowers blooming in the grass. These seemingly mundane images subtly transform and linger in the collector's mind, raising questions about how we process and remember the things we see in our daily lives. This introspective and visually engaging anime invites viewers to ponder the nature of memory and the role of unconscious perception in shaping our experiences.",
