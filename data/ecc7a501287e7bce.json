  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A group of young elementary school students are transported from their classroom into a fantastical ocean adventure after imagining themselves aboard a ship at sea. Though initially thrilled to be aboard the \"Elephant and Lion\" and determined to hunt the elusive whales they seek, apprehension sets in for some as the reality of being lost far from home washes over them. United in their shared voyage but divided on whether to capture or befriend the gentle giants, the children's whaling pursuit transforms into a touching encounter with a benevolent, totoro-like whale as their classroom fantasy draws to a close. This poignant tale reminds us that curiosity and wonder can overcome fear, and that connection rather destruction may be the greatest bounty.",
