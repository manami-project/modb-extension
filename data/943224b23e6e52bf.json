  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ayanoi High School is home to the vibrant Geijutsuka Art Design Class, attended by a group of five close-knit friends who share a passion for art. Energetic prankster Noda, cynical Namiko, kind Miyabi, lively tomboy Tomokane, and innocent, curious Kisaragi immerse themselves in studying various artistic techniques from sketching to photography. Their days are filled with humor and hijinks as they tackle art assignments, play impromptu games like \"color tag\", and get into amusing shenanigans. Noda and Tomokane especially love pulling pranks, much to the chagrin of the grounded Namiko who tries, but fails, to rein them in. Quiet Kyoujyu seems content to watch her peculiar classmates' antics. Through all their adventures, the friends support each other, live life passionately, and let their creativity shine, both in their art and their approach to each unpredictable school day.",
