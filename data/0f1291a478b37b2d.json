  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Deucalion, the year 2016, a brief respite from the war between Earth and the Vers Empire of Mars has lulled humanity into a false sense of security. However, the scars of the past are not easily forgotten, and the peace is shattered when the Vers princess, Asseylum, publicly denounces the Terrans as a destructive and self-indulgent race. As the two factions once again find themselves locked in a bitter struggle for survival, Slaine Troyard, a Terran who has risen through the ranks to become a Mars Knight, finds himself caught in the middle of the conflict. Despite his efforts to protect the Earth, a peaceful resolution seems increasingly unlikely as the war rages on, threatening to forever alter the fate of humanity. As the Deucalion prepares to set sail once again, its former crew members return to face a new battlefront, one that will test their loyalties and determine the future of both Earth and Mars.",
