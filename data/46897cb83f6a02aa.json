  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Even after years of relentless civil war in the country of Uddiyana, peace remains elusive despite the efforts of the United Nations. However, a glimmer of hope emerges when a powerful photograph taken by journalist Saeko Shirasu, depicting civilians and soldiers raising a UN flag together, becomes a symbol of peace. As the image spreads, the possibility of a truce becomes tangible. Yet, extremists opposed to peace steal the flag, pushing the land back towards the brink of war.\n\nTo retrieve the flag and restore hope, the United Nations deploys the Special Development Command (SDC), an elite force equipped with state-of-the-art combat robots known as HAVWCs. Saeko is invited to join the mission and document the journey, but time is running out. As tensions rise among the population, the SDC must race against the clock to find the flag and secure peace for the war-torn land. The director's cut of the war/mecha anime series 'FLAG' masterfully weaves iconic scenes from the series into a compelling and realistic narrative about the struggles of war and the pursuit of peace.",
