  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Usaida and the babysitting club take a backseat as Ryuuichi Kashima dives headfirst into his studies, leaving his younger brother, Kotarou, and the other children inspired to practice their writing skills. Meanwhile, the headmistress' assistant, Keigo Saikawa, steps in to fill Ryuuichi's shoes at the club.\n\nDetermined to express his gratitude to Saikawa for his past support, Ryuuichi embarks on a mission to discover his favorite food, hoping to cook a thank-you meal. Despite the challenge, Ryuuichi remains undeterred, eventually settling on a delicious curry dish for both Saikawa and the chairwoman.\n\nIn a delightful twist, the cast of Gakuen Babysitters comes together to perform a special rendition of Snow White, featuring the chairwoman as the Queen, Inomata as Snow White, and Ryuuichi as the huntsman. As the babies take on the roles of the seven dwarfs, the group sets off on a whimsical adventure, crossing paths with Usaida in the enchanted forest.\n\nThis heartwarming OVA episode, bundled with the seventh Blu-ray volume, showcases the unbreakable bonds between the characters as they navigate school life and their babysitting duties.",
