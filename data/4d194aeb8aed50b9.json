  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryuuichi Kashima is a high school student who helps take care of his younger brother Kotarou and is involved in the school's babysitting club. As exams approach, Ryuuichi takes a break from the club to focus on his studies. His brother Kotarou and the other children he babysits decide to imitate him by diligently practicing their writing. During this time, Ryuuichi is replaced in the babysitting club by Keigo Saikawa, the headmistress' assistant. Ryuuichi is grateful for the help Keigo has given him and Kotarou in the past. As a thank you, Ryuuichi decides to make curry for Keigo, but struggles to figure out Keigo's food preferences. The story also features a comedic Snow White parody involving the headmistress as the evil queen, one of the students trapped studying endlessly as Snow White, Ryuuichi helping the student escape as the huntsman, the babies he babysits playing the seven dwarfs, and more cast members in fairy tale roles. Overall, this lighthearted OVA episode provides amusement around Ryuuichi's efforts to show appreciation, the children's imitation of his diligent studying, and a fun role reversal of the regular cast as fairy tale characters. The episode offers fans more time with these entertaining characters while emphasizing themes of gratitude, supportiveness, and childhood joy.",
