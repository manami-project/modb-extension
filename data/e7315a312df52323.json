  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dojo Atsushi and Kasahara Iku's romantic rendezvous is abruptly halted as a catastrophic terrorist attack on a nuclear power plant sends shockwaves through Japan. Amidst the chaos, the government hastily enacts a law bolstering the Media Betterment Committee's (MBC) authority, enabling them to target not only books but also authors.\n\nThe Librarians, including Kasahara and Dojo, find themselves in a race against time to safeguard Touma Kurato, a renowned author whose novel \"Nuclear Peril\" bears an uncanny resemblance to the recent attack. As the MBC intensifies its pursuit of Kurato, the Library Defense Force (LDF) challenges the legality of the new law, claiming it infringes upon constitutional rights.\n\nWith tensions between the LDF and MBC escalating, Dojo is gravely injured during a confrontation, leaving Kasahara rattled and in charge of Kurato's protection. As the political landscape becomes increasingly volatile, Kasahara must confront the harsh realities of her dream job as a member of the LDF, fighting to preserve freedom of expression against overwhelming odds.",
