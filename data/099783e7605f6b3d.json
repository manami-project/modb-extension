  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lapis, the stunning princess of Sorcerland, is a force to be reckoned with, armed with an enchanting personality and an even more powerful magic eraser that can obliterate anything she wishes. Despite her intellectual shortcomings, her heart is in the right place, as she fiercely protects the innocent creatures of her kingdom, even if it means bringing chaos in her wake. With a peculiar love for pudding, Lapis finds herself magically exiled to the distant Silver Lake by her royal parents, who seek to teach her a lesson about her imprudent use of power. On her journey back home, Lapis encounters a myriad of surprises, including a pudding forest imbued with divine blessings, the peculiar Health Brother Trio, and the formidable Topaz, the witch of the west, who has sinister plans to add Lapis to her collection of little girls.",
