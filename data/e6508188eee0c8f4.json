  "synopsis": {
    "text": "House of Whales is a captivating short animation by Mizuki Kiyama that takes viewers on a journey to a neighborhood bath house, or sento, in Japan. The film, which was made as a graduation project at the Graduate School of Film and New Media at Tokyo University of the Arts, utilizes a unique paint on glass technique to bring the story to life.\n\nThe film follows a young girl as she accompanies her mother to the sento, a daily ritual that becomes a source of child-like fascination and wonder. As the little girl observes the women in the bath house, she is drawn to a group of women who seem to behave differently from the others. To her surprise, she discovers that her mother is a part of this group, and she blends in seamlessly.\n\nAs the story unfolds, the bath house transforms into a space of otherworldly fantasy, filled with feminine intimacy and sensuous wonder. The film won the Lotte Reiniger Promotion Award for Animated Film at the Stuttgart International Festival of Animated Film in Germany, and it's easy to see why. With its stunning visuals and captivating story, House of Whales is a must-see for fans of animation and Japanese culture alike.",
