  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mizuki Kiyama's animated short film utilizes paint on glass technique to depict a young girl visiting a neighborhood sento (bath house) with her mother. Through the girl's eyes, we see her childlike wonder at the intimate feminine rituals occurring in this quotidian space. As she observes the groups of women bathing, her gaze lands on her own mother blended in among them. In this moment, the sento is transformed into a fantastical space where the girl glimpses the separate world the community of women inhabit. Though grounded in the ordinary, Kiyama finds magic in the mundane. This film won the Lotte Reiniger Promotion Award for Animated Film at the Stuttgart International Festival. Originally created as a graduation project exploring the creative possibilities of animation.",
