  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jesus Christ and Gautama Buddha, the revered founders of Christianity and Buddhism, decide to take a vacation from Heaven and rent an apartment together in modern-day Tokyo. As they attempt to blend into Japanese society, hilarious misadventures ensue. Animals are mysteriously drawn to their divine presence, trees spontaneously bear fruit when they pass by, and rumors swirl about two mysterious foreigners with extraordinary abilities. Their well-meaning but bumbling efforts to hide their true identities are further complicated by their lack of knowledge about the modern world. Yet through it all, an unexpected friendship forms between these two religious icons as they discover common ground despite their differing beliefs. This comedic anime follows Christ and Buddha on their comedic misadventures in Japan while conveying lighthearted teachings about Christianity and Buddhism.",
