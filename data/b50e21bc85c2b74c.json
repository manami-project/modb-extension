  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mew and Mica are extraterrestrial androids posing as high school students while secretly protecting the Earth from a range of comical villains. Though sent to defend humanity, these lazy superheroines are easily distracted from their duties by trivial activities like snacking and bickering. When not fighting villains like oversized jellyfish and a supposedly brilliant worm, Mew and Mica come off as normal students, pursued by their male classmates. But their true identities are the Hyper Dolls, legendary if unreliable champions relied upon in times of crisis despite their irresponsible natures. Balancing school life with saving the world proves a difficult task for Mew and Mica. But if these quirky heroes can momentarily focus, they seem capable of overcoming any foe - even their own distracted tendencies - to keep the planet safe.",
