  "synopsis": {
    "text": "These two charming alien androids, Mew and Mica, disguise themselves as adorable high school students while they take on the role of Earth's most unreliable defenders! From battling colossal jellyfish to confronting the supposedly brilliant Ver Worm, no villain is too wicked, too cunning, or too dim-witted for the Hyper Dolls to vanquish â€“ if only they could stop slacking off and snacking on duty.\n\nBalancing their responsibilities as intergalactic guardians with their everyday lives, Mew and Mica struggle to keep their ice cream breaks and squabbles from interfering with their monster-fighting duties. When not in superheroine mode, they appear as ordinary yet captivating schoolgirls, turning heads wherever they go.\n\nAs Mica Minazuki and Mew Fumizuki, they navigate through school events, friendships, and the challenges of adolescence. Will they find the time to protect the world from the sinister forces of the underworld without playing hooky from class? Only time will tell if Earth is truly safe in the hands of these less-than-dedicated defenders.",
