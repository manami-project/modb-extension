    "text": "After the devastating event known as 'Skyfall', a once orbiting space colony plummeted to Earth, creating a massive crater and giving rise to a new breed of gene-mutated creatures known as Kaiju. In this dangerous habitat, an avatar named Ray ventures into the wreckage, seeking valuable artifacts amidst the rubble. During his search, he encounters a mysterious girl named Mil. Her presence in the crater raises questions about her true identity and intentions, leaving Ray to wonder if she is a fellow human or one of the enigmatic Kaiju.",
