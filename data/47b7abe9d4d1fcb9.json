    "text": "Iâ€™ve got a thrilling adventure for you in the icy peaks of the north, as the renowned Goblin Slayer and his loyal party embark on a mission assigned by the Sword Maiden. A seemingly simple task of tracking down a missing group of adventurers turns into a perilous journey filled with unexpected challenges.\n\nA quaint mountain village becomes the stage for a vicious goblin attack, and our heroes stumble upon a mysterious chapel shrouded in secrecy. The Goblin Slayer senses something amiss with these goblins, hinting at a sinister force at play.\n\nIn this adaptation of the fifth light novel volume, the enemy is no ordinary goblin horde. They're an organized army, led by a formidable goblin paladin, and fortified within their own stronghold. With the Priestess, High-elf Archer, Dwarven Mage, and Lizard-man Shaman by his side, Goblin Slayer prepares to face his sworn enemies once more.\n\nJoin Goblin Slayer and his party in \"Goblin Slayer: Goblin's Crown\" as they unravel the mysteries surrounding these goblins, determined to bring back everything they've lost. The first 25 minutes offer a recap of the first season, making it the perfect starting point for newcomers and a refreshing reminder for dedicated fans.",
