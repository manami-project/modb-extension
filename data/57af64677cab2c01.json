    "text": "Tsukushi Makino is a poor girl who manages to enroll in the elite Eitoku Academy, a school dominated by the wealthy and powerful Flower Four (F4). On her first day, Tsukushi hopes to quietly get through high school without trouble. However, after standing up to the F4 for bullying a friend, Tsukushi finds herself the target of their torment. Rather than give in, she stubbornly endures their harassment. In the midst of the conflict, Tsukushi develops romantic feelings for two F4 members, Hanazawa Rui and Nishikado Sojiro. They seem to have more depth than their cruel reputations suggest. As Tsukushi navigates the complications of her budding relationships, she discovers that at Eitoku Academy, there is more than initially meets the eye.",
