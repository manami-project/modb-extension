    "text": "Enix's MMORPG comes to life in \"Million Arthur,\" an anime set in a world thrown into chaos by the proliferation of legendary weapons. Among these weapons, Excalibur holds a sacred place, bestowing its wielder with immense power and the title of \"Arthur.\" However, an unexpected divine miracle has led to the creation of a million Excaliburs, each granting its wielder the title of Arthur.\n\nIn this tumultuous world, an elite group of six Arthurs emerges, each with unique abilities: a sword master, a pugilist, an alchemist, a spell caster, a sharpshooter, and a gunslinger. Their mission is twofold: to restore the original timeline by destroying the surplus Excaliburs of the past, and to overthrow the corrupt leadership that has seized control of England and the world.\n\nAs these six Arthurs journey through time, they must face off against a legion of fellow Arthurs, each vying for the ultimate throne. Amidst the chaos, they strive to protect the kingdom of Camelot and unite the knights under the banner of a single, true King Arthur. Prepare for an epic tale of courage, camaraderie, and conflict as the Arthurs battle against the odds—and each other—in a world where every sword has a story to tell.",
