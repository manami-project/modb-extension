    "text": "She was once a forbidden entity, sealed away for over three centuries for a transgression she committed. Now, she's back in the world of mortals, not as a threat, but as a guardian. Meet Yama Rikudo, a demon huntress with a distinctive pair of horn-like tufts and a formidable scythe. Her mission? To curb the escalating demon infestation in the human realm.\n\nYama finds herself in an unexpected setting: a school, where the headmistress has struck a Faustian bargain with a demon king, trading souls for eternal youth. Despite her superiors' attempts to recall her due to escalating tensions between demons and humans, Yama remains steadfast. She has found a reason to stay and fight - a fellow student named Sho Kurogane, for whom she's developed feelings.\n\nNow, Yama must navigate the treacherous waters of her mission, balancing her duty to eradicate evil with her newfound human emotions. Can she protect Sho and his friends from the malevolent schemes of the soul-sucking headmistress? As a powerful being from the underworld, Yama's journey in the human realm promises a thrilling blend of action, romance, and supernatural intrigue.",
