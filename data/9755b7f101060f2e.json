    "text": "Japanese cuisine captivates the heart of British food and travel journalist Michael Booth, prompting him to embark on a gastronomic adventure of a lifetime. Together with his wife Lissen and their two young sons, Ansger and Emil, they journey across Japan for 100 days, eager to sample the vast array of culinary delights the country has to offer.\n\nInspired by Shizuo Tsuji's book, \"Japanese Cooking: A Simple Art,\" the Booth family's appetite for exploration takes them on a delicious expedition from chanko to yakisoba and everything in between. This light-hearted, family-oriented anime invites viewers to join their fun-filled, trans-national food voyage, providing an entertaining and informative look into the diverse world of Japanese cuisine. From the intriguing okonomiyaki to the somewhat intimidating natto, there's something to satisfy every palate and curiosity.",
