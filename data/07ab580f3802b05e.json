    "text": "In a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by a mysterious \"Dark Mist\", humanity survives in walled-off cities called Arks. 150 years after losing half the planet, private detective Shido Enishi plies his trade in the Ninth Ark. When a simple burglary case leads to hints of a deeper conspiracy, Shido finds the fate of humanity could once again hang in the balance. Mutated monsters and militant factions threaten the fragile peace as Shido races to uncover the truth. Who unleashed the Dark Mist, and why? How does the inexplicable Rivigarudo syndrome tie into a plot spanning generations? To save the Arks, Shido must explore the wastelands beyond the walls and confront the shadows of the past. Mixing sci-fi, mystery and action, this anime follows one tenacious detective against forces threatening to once more doom mankind. Will Shido's skills and determination be enough? Or is humanity destined to fall into darkness?",
