  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The wrestling world witnesses the rise of two young grapplers, Naoto Azuma and Takuma Fujii, who once honed their skills at the humble Zipangu pro wrestling organization before it was ruthlessly crushed by the nefarious Tiger's Den. Seeking vengeance, Naoto secludes himself at the base of Mt. Fuji, embracing the mantle of the legendary Tiger Mask. Meanwhile, Takuma audaciously joins the ranks of Tiger's Den, becoming the formidable Tiger the Dark.\n\nIn the clandestine realm of 'The Tiger's Hole,' where the resurgent wrestling world is orchestrated, two Tiger Masks emerge, each treading distinct paths. One inherits the legacy of the original Tiger Mask, training rigorously at the foot of the sacred mountain, while the other triumphs in brutal competitions within The Tiger's Hole, earning the ominous black Tiger Mask.\n\nTheir faces remain unknown to each other, but destiny binds them as rivals in the ring. Yet, they share a common goal: to bring down the malevolent Tiger's Hole. As one Tiger Mask strides in the light and the other lurks in the shadows, the wrestling world braces for their earth-shattering clash.",
