    "text": "Ikoku Meiro no Crois√©e is an anime that follows Yune, a young Japanese girl who travels to 19th century Paris to live and work at an ironwork shop. There, she befriends Alice, the shop owner's daughter. In one episode, Yune encounters Anne, a bohemian girl singing Japanese songs. Captivated by Anne's performance, Alice decides to invite her to perform at one of her high-society parties, with Yune joining her on stage. The musical recital goes smoothly, delighting the audience. Afterwards, Alice and Yune look forward to seeing Anne again in the future. This particular episode was first streamed online for a limited time before being included in the anime's Blu-ray/DVD release. It offers a glimpse into Yune adjusting to her new European surroundings with the help of new friends like Alice who share her interest in Japanese culture. Their budding friendship and intercultural exchange are central themes of this historical anime.",
