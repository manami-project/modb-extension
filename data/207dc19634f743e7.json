    "text": "Ryuuji Takane has just won the Japanese Junior Boxing Championship, but his next challenge awaits. The American Junior Champion, Black Shaft, arrives to challenge Ryuuji and Japan's top junior boxers prior to the World Junior Boxing Tournament. Black Shaft assembles a formidable team to take on Ryuuji, Kazuki, Takeshi, Ishimatsu and the rest. His team includes a dangerous convict, the leader of a notorious American gang, a mysterious woman fighter, and other hardened competitors. Shaft aims not just to defeat the Japanese boxers, but to crush their spirits right before the world tournament. Additionally, Shaft initiates backup plans, secretly negotiating with the Italian Junior Champion Don Juliano in case his team falls short. With the pride and hopes of Japanese boxing on the line, Ryuuji faces his greatest test yet against Black Shaft's ruthless squadron. Through this trial by fire, the Japanese fighters must prove themselves worthy of competing on the world stage.",
