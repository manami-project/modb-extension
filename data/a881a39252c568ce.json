    "text": "Stone of Legend and a Hero's Quest: In the quaint village of Aliahan, the spirited Tiara and her loyal friend, Abel, lead simple lives. On Tiara's 16th birthday, she is bestowed with the legendary Red Stone by the wise village sage, Master Yogi. This precious artifact, passed down through generations, holds the power to awaken the Great Dragon, whose blood promises eternal life.\n\nWhen the malevolent Baramos learns of the Red Stone, he seizes Tiara, intent on using the stone to achieve immortality. With the village in ruins and Tiara in peril, Abel is entrusted with the sacred Blue Stone, capable of sealing the Dragon once awakened.\n\nEmbarking on a daring journey, Abel assembles a motley crew of allies: Mokomoko, the reformed village bully; Yannack, the amorous mage; and Daisy, the mercenary with a penchant for wealth. Together, they traverse a world filled with peril and wonder, seeking fragments of the ancient Dragon Legend to unlock the secrets of the Red and Blue Stones.\n\nAs Baramos dispatches his jewel monsters to thwart their progress, Abel must rise as a true hero to save Tiara, vanquish Baramos, and safeguard their world from the wrath of the Great Dragon.",
