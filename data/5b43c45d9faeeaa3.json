    "text": "Fukuzou Moguro, known as the Laughing Salesman, is no ordinary merchant. He trades in desires and souls, offering people their heart's deepest longings in exchange for a promise. In a world where many struggle to find fulfillment, Moguro's alluring deals seem like the answer to their prayers. But beware: those who dare to cheat, disregard his advice, or deny his assistance face dire consequences. Once the deal is made and desires are fulfilled, Moguro's customers often find themselves entangled in a web of devastating repercussions, especially if they break his rules. With a chilling laugh, Moguro moves on to his next customer, eager to fill the emptiness in their souls. Will you be his next client?",
