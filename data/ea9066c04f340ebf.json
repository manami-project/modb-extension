    "text": "Acid rain falls on the ruins of Tokyo in 2023, three decades after the Silent Crisis devastated the world. Amidst the chaos, otherworldly creatures known as Lucifer Hawks have descended upon Earth, threatening to enslave humanity. In response, the Attacked Mystification Police Department (AMP), a special division of the Tokyo Police, has assembled a team of women with extraordinary paranormal abilities. Among them are Yuki, a psychic, Kiddy, a cyborg, Nami, a Shinto priestess, and Lebia, a visionaire, all led by the enigmatic Rally Cheyenne. As the Lucifer Hawks intensify their attacks, the AMP's newest member, Katsumi Liqueur, joins the fray, bringing her own mysterious powers and a shadowy past. With the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, Katsumi and her fellow AMP officers must harness their unique abilities to vanquish the Lucifer Hawks and save the world from the brink of destruction. Will they succeed in their mission, or will the forces of darkness prevail? Only time will tell.",
