  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They say destiny is not a matter of chance, but a matter of choice. For young Arthur, his destiny was chosen the day he pulled the legendary sword Excalibur from its stone, revealing him as the rightful heir to the throne of Britain. Raised by a noble knight and safeguarded by the wise magician Merlin, Arthur must now face the malevolent King Lavic and his dark sorceress Medessa to reclaim his kingdom.\n\nWith the future of the realm hanging in the balance, Arthur embarks on a perilous journey to find the Holy Shield, the only artifact powerful enough to vanquish his enemies. Along the way, he crosses paths with four valiant knights - Lancelot, Perceval, Tristan, and Guerrehet - who share his vision of a just and peaceful kingdom. Together, they traverse the countryside, aiding the oppressed and battling the forces of darkness.\n\nAs Arthur and his loyal knights journey towards the Holy Shield, they strive to create a utopian kingdom free from the tyranny of Lavic and his cronies. Their mission is clear: restore peace and prosperity to the land, and create a new era of hope for the people of Britain. With courage in their hearts and justice on their side, they march onwards, determined to fulfill their destiny and bring about the rise of the Kingdom of Logres.",
