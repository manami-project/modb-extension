  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dariel is a veteran soldier in the Demon King's army, having served for over 30 years. Despite lacking magic abilities, he earned an esteemed position as assistant to one of the Four Demon Generals due to his intellect, talent and ambition. However, after a change in leadership, the new Demon Lord fires Dariel for his perceived weakness. Now unemployed, Dariel wanders the forests aimlessly until he rescues a human girl named Malika from a monster attack. As gratitude, she invites him back to her village to stay. There, Dariel discovers his adventuring skills prove quite useful to the villagers, who begin requesting his help with various tasks. As Dariel finds purpose using his unique talents to aid humans, he uncovers a shocking revelation - that he himself is human. With this newfound knowledge, Dariel must contemplate his complex relationship with the demons he once called allies and whether to involve himself in the enduring conflict between humans and demons.",
