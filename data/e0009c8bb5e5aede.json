    "text": "Kamichama Karin follows the story of Karin Hanazono, a 13-year-old girl who has faced much tragedy in her young life. Having lost both her parents, she now lives with her unkind aunt and struggles with poor grades at school. Even her beloved pet cat Shi-chan has recently died, leaving Karin completely alone. The only memento she has left of her parents is a mysterious ring gifted by her mother. Karin's life takes an unexpected turn when she meets Kazune Kujyou, an orphaned boy around her age, and his cousin Himeka. Kazune possesses godlike powers of his own, and when they detect the power in Karin's ring, they reveal to her that she has the ability to transform into a goddess. It turns out Karin's mother was divine, and others with ill intentions are now seeking Karin's ring for its power. Thrust into this divine world, Karin moves in with Kazune and Himeka. Together, the trio set out on adventures to protect Karin's ring, learn more about their mysterious powers, and defend themselves against the evil Karasuma Kirio. Along the way, they befriend others who aid them on their journey and may know critical details about Kazune's own past. Though her life remains chaotic, with her newfound friends and abilities, Karin finds meaning and purpose she has long been missing.",
