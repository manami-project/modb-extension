Orphaned at a young age, Karin is left to live with her aunt who is less than kind to her. With poor grades and no friends, Karin's only source of comfort is her beloved cat, Shi-chan, who recently passed away.\n\nEverything changes when Karin meets Kazune, a fellow 7th grader who is also an orphan, and his cousin Himeka. It is through them that Karin discovers the true power of her mother's ring, which allows her to transform into a goddess. As she embarks on this new journey, Karin must navigate through crazy adventures, meet new friends, and protect her ring and Himeka from those who seek to harm them.\n\nWith her newfound powers, Karin must also face the mysterious Karasuma Kirio, who has divine powers of his own and harbors evil intentions. Along the way, she may also uncover information about the divine transformation of gods and goddesses, as well as Kazune's long-lost father.\n\nKamichama Karin is a heartwarming tale of a young girl who finds the strength to overcome her difficulties and discover her true potential.
