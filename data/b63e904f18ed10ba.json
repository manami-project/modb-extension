  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over a decade ago in eastern Japan, a catastrophic disaster known as the Kagutsu Incident claimed over 700,000 lives. This tragedy was triggered by a clash between two kings with supernatural abilities - the Red King Genji Kagutsu and the Blue King Jin Habari. Both kings perished in the aftermath. Years later, Gouki Zenjo, a survivor of the incident and former right-hand man to the late Blue King Jin Habari, returns to work for SCEPTER 4. This special police force is now led by Reisi Munakata, the newly appointed Blue King. Still grappling with the loss of his previous master, Gouki struggles to accept Munakata's leadership. However, when Munakata assigns Gouki to personally train a promising young recruit named Takeru Kusuhara, he insists that Gouki's mentorship will prove pivotal to SCEPTER 4's future. As Takeru's abilities develop under his supervision, Gouki may finally come to terms with serving a new Blue King.",
