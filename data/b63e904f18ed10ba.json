Now, Goki Zenjo, once Jin Habari's trusted right-hand man and a survivor of the calamity, has rejoined SCEPTER 4 under the leadership of the new Blue King, Reisi Munakata. However, Zenjo grapples with accepting Munakata as his new king. One day, Munakata assigns Zenjo to mentor a young recruit named Takeru Kusuhara, emphasizing that Zenjo's teachings will be vital for SCEPTER 4's future.",
