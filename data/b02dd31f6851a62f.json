    "text": "We embark on a journey to the realm of Dia Horizon, a Square Enix-produced multimedia project that kicks off with a captivating TV anime series. In this world, the thrill of exploration has faded as uncharted territories have become a thing of the past. Adventuring has been reduced to a mere 9-to-5 job, with adventurers trudging along like typical salarymen.\n\nAmidst this monotonous existence, a young girl finds herself confined to a narrow and controlled life. Born with a secret that holds the key to the end of the horizon, she is denied the freedom to live as she desires. For her, the concept of 'freedom' is nothing more than an elusive dream. With her destiny dictated by an unseen hand, she makes a daring choice: to share her fate, even if it means sharing death.\n\nAs we delve deeper into the story, we discover an intricate narrative of intertwined lives, shared destinies, and the relentless pursuit of freedom. Will they find hope, freedom, or perhaps something entirely unexpected beyond the horizon's end? Join us in this thrilling adventure to find out!",
