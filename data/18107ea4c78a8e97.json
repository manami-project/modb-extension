  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Matsuri OVA's special episode takes viewers on a humorous journey into the realm of dating sims, where the right moves can lead to love, but misunderstandings and unexpected twists abound. The episode, presented in the style of a visual novel game on a Nintendo DS, is divided into three entertaining segments that poke fun at the conventions of dating sims and handheld gaming. In this world, even a seemingly innocent pinky promise can take an unexpected turn, and the object of your affection might not be who you initially thought. This special was first unveiled at Comiket 78 and later shared on YouTube and the official website, before being included with the first Blu-ray/DVD volume of the Matsuri OVA. Prepare for a light-hearted exploration of love, gaming, and the unpredictable outcomes that can arise when the two collide.",
