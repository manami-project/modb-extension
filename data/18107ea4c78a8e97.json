  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the information provided, this anime revolves around the world of dating simulation video games. The story follows characters who are trying to navigate relationships and romance within the fictional setting of these games. There is a focus on selecting the right dialogue options, known as \"flags,\" in order to progress the relationships in a desired direction. However, things don't always go as planned - promises between characters may be broken, or the gender of a love interest might turn out to be different than initially thought. The anime has been promoted through videos mimicking the visual style of dating sim games played on a Nintendo DS system. One video aims to showcase the premise in this style as a spoof. Additionally, a short special OVA episode was released containing comedic vignettes poking fun at common dating sim and visual novel tropes. Overall, this metafictional anime uses satire and parody to explore the complicated social dynamics that can emerge between characters in dating simulations, while also staying lighthearted in tone. Fans of the genre may appreciate the affectionate references to common cliches and dramatic plot twists.",
