    "text": "Nabu Island, a serene paradise far from Japan, becomes the training ground for the budding heroes of UA Class 1-A during their winter break. Without the safety net of their instructors, Deku, Bakugo, and their classmates are tasked with establishing their own Hero Agency to assist the island's residents with everyday tasks and challenges. However, their peaceful training takes a dark turn with the emergence of Nine, a formidable villain with a mysterious connection to a familiar foe.\n\nNine's sinister plan involves finding a specific 'quirk' to establish a society ruled by those with the most powerful abilities. As chaos unfolds and the island's tranquility is shattered, the students of UA Class 1-A must rise to the occasion and protect the citizens while confronting their most significant threat yet. Complicating matters further, a young boy named Katsuma Shimano, who has befriended Deku, becomes a target, forcing the heroes-in-training to devise a strategy to ensure his safety.\n\nWith All Might retired and the future of hero society hanging in the balance, Deku and his friends must rely on their skills, courage, and camaraderie to defeat Nine and his accomplices. Will they emerge victorious and secure a peaceful future, or will they succumb to the overwhelming odds in this seemingly hopeless situation?",
