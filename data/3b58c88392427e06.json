    "text": "Legend tells of the Monkey King, the most powerful fighter who could freely traverse heaven, earth and hell. However, after breaking sacred rules set by the gods, he was imprisoned in an icy cage within the mountains, the only prison able to contain his immense power. In his absence, darkness spreads through the land. 500 years later, young Liuer's village is attacked by monsters. As the sole survivor, he escapes to the mountains where he discovers the frozen Monkey King. By accident, Liuer melts his icy cage, freeing the legendary warrior. With encouragement from Liuer, a grateful Monkey King confronts the spreading evil to redeem himself and rescue the besieged villages. Though the gods seek to contain him once more, the Monkey King is determined to save the people and see light restored to the land. Will he triumph and be the hero China needs? Or will he be condemned back to his icy prison for eternity?",
