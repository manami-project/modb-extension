    "text": "Kyousuke Kasuga, Madoka Ayukawa, and Hikaru Hiyama are on the brink of adulthood, navigating the complexities of love, friendship, and future aspirations in the sequel to the beloved 80's series, Kimagure Orange Road. As Kyousuke and Madoka enter their final year of high school, they find themselves preoccupied with college entrance exams and the daunting task of choosing a college that accommodates both their needs. Meanwhile, Hikaru, still a year away from graduation, struggles with the impending separation from her closest friends.\n\nIn the midst of this emotional turmoil, Kyousuke is forced to confront his feelings for both Madoka and Hikaru, as Madoka's jealousy of Hikaru's support for Kyousuke reaches a boiling point. With time running out, Kyousuke must make a difficult decision that will ultimately shape the course of their lives.\n\nThis poignant film explores the bittersweet reality of growing up, as the trio grapples with the challenges of young love, self-discovery, and the inevitable march of time. A heart-wrenching tale that resonates with the fleeting nature of youth, it serves as a touching reminder that some choices have the power to change everything.",
