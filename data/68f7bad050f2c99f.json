    "text": "Rumbling Hearts is a romantic drama that follows the intertwining relationships between high school students Takayuki Narumi, Haruka Suzumiya, Mitsuki Hayase, and Shinji Taira. The story begins when the shy Haruka works up the courage to confess her feelings to her crush Takayuki, with the support of her best friend Mitsuki. Though uncertain at first, Takayuki agrees to date Haruka. As their new relationship progresses, Takayuki finds himself growing closer to Mitsuki as well, and realizes they have feelings for each other. But just when things seem to be going well for the group of friends, tragedy strikes - Haruka is involved in a terrible accident that leaves her in a coma. When Haruka awakens three years later, the lives of Takayuki, Mitsuki and Shinji have changed dramatically. Haruka's sudden return threatens the bonds between the friends as they struggle to come to terms with what has transpired in the intervening years. Rumbling Hearts is an emotional drama that explores the joys and pains of young love, the strength of friendship, and how lives can be irrevocably altered in a single moment. At its core, it is a story of human connection and the difficult choices we sometimes face in matters of the heart.",
