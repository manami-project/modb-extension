    "text": "After a distressing past entangled in mystery-solving, Jōgorō Kobato and Yuki Osanai, two first-year high school students, yearn for a tranquil and ordinary life. To achieve this, they form an alliance to maintain a low profile and blend in as average students. However, their plans for a peaceful existence are disrupted by a series of intriguing mysteries and calamities that keep emerging.\n\nDespite their best efforts to resist the allure of these puzzling incidents, Kobato, with the assistance of his close friend Kengo, finds himself irresistibly drawn to them. From a missing handbag to a pair of identical paintings, a perfectly brewed cup of cocoa, and a mysterious shattered bottle, these reluctant sleuths are presented with a plethora of intellectual challenges and amusement.\n\nAs they navigate through these mysteries, the duo's resolve to lead ordinary lives is tested further when Osanai's bicycle, along with a strawberry tart, is stolen. The clues lead them into unforeseen danger, making their pursuit of a peaceful life even more elusive. Will Kobato and Osanai manage to realize their dream of living as ordinary citizens amidst the whirlwind of mysteries surrounding them?",
