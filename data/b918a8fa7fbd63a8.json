  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shinji's world is turned upside down when he is summoned to Tokyo-3 by his estranged father, Gendou Ikari, who reveals that Shinji is the only one capable of piloting the Evangelion Unit-01, a giant humanoid robot designed to combat the monstrous Angels that threaten humanity. With the weight of the world on his shoulders, Shinji must confront his own inner demons and the trauma of his past while battling the Angels, who seem to be harbingers of a second apocalyptic event known as the Second Impact. Alongside fellow pilots Rei and Asuka, and with the support of NERV, a special agency under the United Nations, Shinji must find the strength and courage to defend humanity and uncover the secrets behind the Angels and the Evangelions. But as the battles rage on, Shinji begins to realize that his father may have ulterior motives for involving him in this war, and that the true enemy may be closer than he thinks.",
