    "text": "Dragonar Academy is a prestigious institution where students learn to ride and tame dragons, but for first-year student Ash Blake, things aren't going according to plan. Despite bearing the sacred star brand that marks him as a future dragon master, Ash is the laughing stock of the school due to his lack of a dragon companion. But everything changes when his dragon finally awakens in the form of a beautiful girl with a fiery attitude. This dragon is unlike any other, and she's determined to be Ash's master rather than his servant. As Ash struggles to navigate his new partnership, dark forces threaten the safety of the academy and its dragons. Can Ash and his dragon overcome their differences and work together to save the day? Join Ash on his journey from problem child to hero in this thrilling anime adventure.",
