  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Catman, a solitary anthropomorphic cat-person, roams a bustling city filled with fellow feline inhabitants. With a rebellious spirit, Catman defies conventions, living life on his own terms, often clashing with the city's other residents. The series offers a unique viewing experience as it unfolds without spoken dialogue, instead featuring subtitles in both Japanese and English. The absence of dialogue is compensated by a captivating original soundtrack that sets the tone for Catman's adventures.\n\nFrom aimless gambling to inebriated bowling sessions, Catman navigates the trials and tribulations of his city, often finding himself at odds with his surroundings. Despite his disdain for the city, he continues to carve out his own path, making the most of his circumstances.\n\nThe Catman series is a pioneering work in flash animation, marking the debut of Aoike Ryousuke in this medium. Its unique approach to storytelling and animation earned it the prestigious GRAFIKA design festival prize for Best Digital Animation in 2003. Join Catman in his daring escapades and experience a unique blend of animation and music that brings this feline world to life.",
