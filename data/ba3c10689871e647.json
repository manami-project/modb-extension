    "text": "Masaki and Hiromu Fujiyoshi, a devoted couple, have overcome numerous obstacles to create their idyllic family life. As an omega, Masaki, a stay-at-home parent, has faced societal prejudice and personal insecurities, but Hiromu's unwavering love and commitment have remained steadfast. Their beautiful journey led them to welcome their son, Hikari, and move to a child-friendly neighborhood to provide him with a nurturing environment.\n\nIn their new home, they forge heartwarming connections with neighbors like the Hirai family and Yuuki, a college student living next door, as well as Hiromu's work friends and fellow parents they meet at the park. Despite the joy their new life brings, the couple cannot completely escape their past. Memories of past hostilities linger, and Hiromu's disapproving family continues their attempts to separate the couple.\n\nHowever, Hiromu and Masaki's love for each other and their son remains unshakable. As they watch Hikari grow and thrive, they find solace in the love that binds them together. With every challenge they face, they grow stronger as a family, and the possibility of expanding their family in the future brings them even more hope and happiness. Together, they stand united, ready to face anything life throws their way for the sake of their precious family.",
