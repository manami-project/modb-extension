    "text": "Shadows of mischief loom over Princess Land, a European-themed amusement park, where Nozomi and her friends revel in a day of royal make-believe, dressed as princes and princesses. Suddenly, their joyous day takes a dark turn when two of their companions, Coco and Nuts, are snatched away by peculiar bear-like creatures, Migirin and Hidarin.\n\nThe girls find themselves transported to a mysterious realm known as the Country of Mirrors, where they come face-to-face with their sinister doppelg√§ngers. To make matters worse, an evil clown named Shadow schemes to seize the Dream Collet, a powerful artifact that harnesses the energy of the Pinkies. If Shadow succeeds, the Mirror Kingdom will fall under his dominion.\n\nWith the stakes higher than ever, Nozomi and her friends must join forces with Migirin and Hidarin, who turn out to be inhabitants of the Mirror Kingdom. As Pretty Cure, they must confront their mirror-image foes and outwit the nefarious Shadow to rescue Coco and Nuts. Will they triumph against their own reflections and restore harmony to the Mirror Kingdom?",
