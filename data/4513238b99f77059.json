  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Suffocated by the overwhelming benevolence of a society that values health above all else, high school student Miach Mihie and two of her friends, Tuan Kirie and Cian Reikadou, make a pact to commit suicide as an act of rebellion against the oppressive utopia. However, only Miach succeeds, and Tuan is left to navigate a world where medical nanotechnology and a strict code of social welfare have created a seemingly perfect society. Thirteen years later, Tuan, now a high-ranking inspector for the World Health Organization, is sent back to Japan after her drug smuggling activities are discovered. Upon her return, she is faced with a wave of mass suicides and must investigate the terrorist organization behind the attack. As Tuan delves deeper into the case, she begins to suspect that her old friend Miach may be involved, despite having supposedly died years earlier. In a world where perfection has been achieved at the cost of individual freedom, Tuan must confront her past and uncover the truth behind the mysterious mass suicides before it's too late.",
