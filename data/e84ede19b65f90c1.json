  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Greek Goddess Venus, envious of the human girl Psyche's beauty and happiness, banishes her pet unicorn, Unico, believing him to be the source of Psyche's good fortune. Unico, with his extraordinary ability to bring happiness to anyone he encounters, is exiled to wander through time and space by the West Wind. In one such journey, Unico arrives in a city plagued by pollution from a nearby factory, causing the sky to darken and the inhabitants to fall ill. Here, he befriends a sickly girl named Chiko, who becomes the focus of his mission to bring joy, restore health, and eliminate the source of the city's pollution. This heartwarming tale showcases Unico's determination to save Chiko and the city, while featuring beautiful animation that was initially created as a pilot film for a theater movie but gained recognition through video release.",
