    "text": "Akira Takaoka, a dedicated member of the Electric Brain Study Society, has been diligently saving for three years to buy his first computer. When he finally gets the chance to purchase a PC9821 at an unbeatable price, he's devastated to find that the stock has been depleted. However, fortune seems to smile upon him when a mysterious man in an alley offers him the same deal. Eagerly, Akira accepts, only to discover that the computer he's bought isn't the PC9821, but a PC2198 - an advanced bio-type computer named Mimi.\n\nMimi, unlike any other computer, requires a unique form of input to function optimally - Akira's 'active molecules'. As if this wasn't challenging enough, Mimi finds herself under attack from the nefarious Apple Nacintosh sisters, who harbor sinister plans for the Japanese PC market. Now, Akira must navigate the embarrassment of supplying Mimi with her necessary inputs while also protecting her from these malevolent forces.\n\nAs Akira's life takes a dramatic turn, he must find a way to balance his new responsibilities and explain Mimi's presence to his friends. With the future shrouded in uncertainty, one thing is clear - Akira is in for an unexpected and thrilling adventure.",
