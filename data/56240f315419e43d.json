  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuki Akamatsu is a high school student who joins his school's Journalism Club at the request of his cousin Ayaka Nikaidou, the club president. He is assigned to manage the advice column for the school newspaper, where students can anonymously submit personal problems and ask for guidance. To help Yuuki with the column, Ayaka recruits three girls with diverse personalities and areas of expertise: Rino Endou, a smart but shy science student; Ikumi Suzuki, an outgoing athlete; and Fumi Kujou, a sweet and cultured liberal arts scholar. While the three girls often disagree on the best advice to give, together with Yuuki they find creative solutions by debating different perspectives and conducting social experiments around school. In the process of helping their classmates, Yuuki and the three advice column girls learn to understand themselves and each other better too. By collaborating on the newspaper's life advice column, the four students form meaningful friendships and gain confidence in solving school life's interpersonal problems.",
