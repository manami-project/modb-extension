Suguru, the brother of Komari and Natsumi, secures the grand prize in a shopping mall lottery draw, setting the stage for an exciting adventure.\n\nAs the anticipation builds, the group of friends begins their preparations for the journey. They engage in unique activities to familiarize themselves with air travel and gather essential supplies from the local convenience store. Meanwhile, Renge, a thoughtful member of the group, contemplates the impact of this trip on her worldview, bidding a heartfelt farewell to her familiar countryside surroundings.\n\nWith the day of departure finally arriving, the gang embarks on their flight, leaving behind their usual Asahigaoka scenery for the sunny beaches of Okinawa.
