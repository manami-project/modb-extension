  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Joestar family's bizarre journey begins with Jonathan Joestar, an aristocratic boy living in Victorian England, who finds his life disrupted by the arrival of Dio Brando, a mysterious boy with a connection to his father. Dio's obsession with an ancient stone mask kept by Jonathan's father leads to a fierce rivalry between the two. Dio's manipulative tactics to secure his position as the Joestar family's heir include turning friends against Jonathan, beating him in a boxing match, and stealing his girlfriend. When Jonathan's father falls ill under mysterious circumstances, he discovers Dio's sinister plan to poison both him and his father to gain power and wealth. But that's just the beginning. As Dio transforms into an immortal vampire using the stone mask, Jonathan must learn the ancient martial arts technique of Hamon from the eccentric Will A. Zeppeli to stop Dio's quest for world domination. This is the first chapter of the Joestar family's multi-generational battle against supernatural enemies.",
