  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Humanity's endless quest for knowledge leads them to the distant planet Solo, where they uncover mysterious ancient ruins belonging to a long-extinct alien civilization. Among the relics are three large vehicles and a powerful warship which the humans dub Ideon. However, they soon find themselves under attack from the Buff Clan, a militant alien race seeking to capture Ideon and the mystical energy source it contains known as Id. In the ensuing conflict, the surviving humans board the warship christened Solo Ship and join forces with Ideon to defend themselves. Through many fierce battles, they slowly uncover the secrets of the advanced ancient weapons at their disposal. Yet the Buff Clan remains relentless in their pursuit of Ideon and its limitless potential. The humans realize that the very power they now control may determine the fate of both their species as they struggle against their alien foes.",
