  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiyori Iki is excited to start high school with her friends Ami and Yama. However, on the first day, her soul accidentally slips out of her body while she sleeps in class. The minor deity Yato takes advantage of this and possesses Hiyori's empty body, using it to pull embarrassing pranks to advertise his god services. Later, Hiyori invites friends including Yato and Bishamon to view cherry blossoms together and enjoy a peaceful day. But tensions rise between Yato and his rival Bishamon, threatening the harmony of the occasion. In another instance, Yato again possesses Hiyori's body while she sleeps, causing all sorts of mortifying chaos as Hiyori struggles to reclaim her body. Yukine tries getting help from other gods to stop Yato's nonsense but they end up distracted. Hiyori and Yukine then catch a male student who snuck cameras into the girls' locker room, realizing he's possessed. As the student attempts suicide, Yato rescues him, expelling the evil phantom but injuring Hiyori's body in the process. Yato faces punishment while Hiyori starts school with an odd reputation.",
