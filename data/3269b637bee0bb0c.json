    "text": "Three teenagers named Makoto, Adi, and Chloe gain extraordinary abilities as a result of genetic experimentation by the evil organization Hydra. Initially forced to serve Hydra's sinister plans, the youths have a change of heart during their first confrontation with the Avengers superhero team. Deciding to turn against their captors, they escape Hydra only to be recaptured, then freed by the intervention of Iron Man. Recognizing their potential for good, the Avengers take the fledgling superhumans under their tutelage. Nicknamed the \"Future Avengers,\" Makoto, Adi, and Chloe begin training under Avengers members like Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, and Wasp. As the young heroes learn to control their powers and battle threats alongside their mentors, they inch closer to becoming heroes in their own right, continuing the Avengers' legacy into a new generation.",
