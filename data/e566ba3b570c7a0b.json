    "text": "When space pirate Hunter kidnaps Warrius Zero, Captain Harlock finds himself entangled in the scheme despite his reluctance to get involved. Bound by a promise to protect his friend Toshiro's mysterious research base on a remote planet, Harlock navigates the various agendas at play. On one side, the pirates aim to defeat Harlock and seize Zero's ship for themselves. On the other, Zero seeks vengeance against Harlock for reasons tied to their past. Meanwhile, Toshiro's work on the remote planet could alter the fate of the galaxy. As Hunter closes in, Harlock works to uphold his promise to Toshiro while warding off Zero and the pirates. The various factions collide in a decisive battle where more than personal vendettas are at stake. The outcomes will impact the galaxy and may reveal surprises about Harlock's true motivations. Full of intrigue and personal drama, the story promises action and adventure as strong-willed individuals struggle for the upper hand. Yet there may be more at play than any faction realizes.",
