  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hina Saotome is an office worker who finds herself wrongfully imprisoned. At the Kokuyoku Prison, she comes under the strict supervision of Aki Myojin, a handsome yet cold and domineering warden. Though she maintains her innocence, Hina is subjected to invasive searches and examinations at Aki's hands, which her body seems to respond to against her wishes. Even during monitored visits with her lover, Aki exerts dominance and control. Bit by bit, Hina feels her body and mind slipping into submission under Aki's authority. Two versions exist - one aired on TV, while an uncensored Internet version depicts events more explicitly. Despite protesting her innocence and situation, Hina struggles to resist the hypnotic spell cast by the warden. Ultimately, her future and fate seem to rest in this man's firm grip.",
