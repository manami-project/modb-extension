  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With the tranquil village of Staccato plunged into chaos by the sudden onslaught of demons, the entire realm of Sforzando finds itself teetering on the brink of destruction. The root cause of this calamity is the weakening of a once-robust barrier, erected to keep the demonic hordes from invading the human world. This protective shield is the lifelong labor of Queen Horn of Sforzando, who now finds her strength waning after years of tireless maintenance.\n\nThe ominous figure behind this resurgence of darkness is none other than Hell King Bass, who seeks to breach the barrier and unleash the unparalleled power of Kestra, the 'supreme leader' of the demon world, who remains trapped in the human realm.\n\nYears ago, the war between Sforzando and the hordes of darkness reached a dramatic conclusion when Queen Horn managed to imprison the monstrous legions in Pandora's Box, restoring peace to the land. However, Bass's relentless assaults have gradually eroded the barrier, threatening to plunge the world back into chaos.\n\nAmidst this turmoil, a young man named Hamelin, blessed with the unique ability to wield 'magic music,' embarks on a perilous journey to thwart the impending evil. Haunted by a past he cannot remember, Hamelin is joined by his childhood friend, Flute, and Oboe, a sentient bird. Together, they must confront their destinies, navigating a complex web of guilt, betrayal, and loss in this captivating musical saga of a violinist's quest to safeguard those he holds dear.",
