  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Relegated to the stars, the Angel Brigade, an elite division of the Transvaal Empire military, embarks on a cosmic quest to uncover the enigmatic 'Lost Technology'. Led by the soon-to-retire Colonel Volcott O'Huey, the team navigates the universe in their Emblem Frame ships, ready to tackle any mission that comes their way. From locating missing pets to assisting indebted pizzerias, no task is too mundane or too grand for these galactic guardians.\n\nAt the heart of the Angel Brigade is the ever-enthusiastic and air-headed Milfeulle Sakuraba, who, despite her insatiable appetite, never fails to bring optimism to the team. Joining her is the voluptuous and strong-willed Ranpha, the cold and composed Vanilla, the regal and business-savvy Mint, and the aggressive gun-toting Forte. Together, they form an unlikely yet formidable force, ready to save the galaxy one planet at a time.\n\nHowever, their primary mission to find the Lost Technology often takes a backseat as the Angel Brigade finds themselves in all sorts of peculiar and comedic situations. From defusing talking missiles to infiltrating monkey-infested outposts, these intergalactic angels prove that their work is never truly done. With a suicidal missile AI turned stuffed animal as their companion, the Angel Brigade continues their chaotic yet entertaining journey across the cosmos.",
