  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kobayashi Sanpeita is a high school student who has a childhood friend that he was engaged to marry when they were young. Ten years after making that promise, a strange event occurs - a tiny robot girl named Kemeko crashes into Sanpeita's bedroom, proclaiming herself as his new bride. Kemeko is soon revealed to be a powered combat suit piloted by none other than Sanpeita's long lost childhood friend and promised bride, Mishima Mei. Mei looks exactly the same as when they were children. It turns out she is connected to the mysterious Mishima Electronics Corporation. Now Sanpeita's life is turned upside down as he gets caught up in the chaos caused by Kemeko and Mishima Electronics. Despite her violent tendencies while battling enemy robots, the pilot Mei still has feelings for Sanpeita from their childhood promise. While all Sanpeita wants is a normal high school life, he continuously gets drawn into the antics surrounding his supposed new \"steel bride\" Kemeko and his long lost love Mei.",
