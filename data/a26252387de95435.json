    "text": "The anime follows the Seirin High School basketball team as they reach the finals of the Winter Cup tournament, where they face off against the formidable Rakuzan High School. Rakuzan, led by their captain Seijuurou Akashi, has established themselves as the dominant force in high school basketball. Akashi possesses the Emperor Eye ability, allowing him to predict and counter the opposing team's every move. In the semi-finals, Rakuzan defeats Shutoku High School and their ace Midorima. The finals see Seirin's tenacious duo Taiga Kagami and Tetsuya Kuroko challenged like never before. Akashi's Emperor Eye initially overwhelms Kagami and Seirin, but Kuroko refuses to give up. The two teams are pitted in an intense matchup that will test Seirin's teamwork against Rakuzan's absolute control of the game. The synergy between Kagami and Kuroko is pushed to its limits as they attempt to find a way to break through Akashi's omniscience on the court.",
