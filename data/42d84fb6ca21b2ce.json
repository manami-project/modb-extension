The young middle school student discovers that San is not just an ordinary girl, but a mermaid from a powerful yakuza family. According to merfolk law, Nagasumi must either marry San or face death for learning her secret. With no other choice, Nagasumi reluctantly agrees to marry San.\n\nAs Nagasumi navigates his new life with San, he must contend with her overprotective father, Gouzaburou, and the rest of the Seto clan, who are not exactly thrilled with the union. To make matters worse, Nagasumi must keep San's true identity a secret from his family and friends.\n\nDespite the challenges, Nagasumi and San's relationship blossoms into a genuine and innocent love. However, with Gouzaburou's constant attempts on Nagasumi's life and the eccentric antics of a slew of antagonists, the newlyweds must fight to keep their love alive and protect each other from harm.\n\nWill Nagasumi and San be able to overcome the obstacles in their way and live happily ever after, or will their love story come to a tragic end? Only time will tell in this thrilling and romantic adventure.",
