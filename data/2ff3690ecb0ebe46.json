  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mihoshi Special is a side story narrated by Mihoshi Kuramitsu about her life as a Galaxy Police officer. It introduces her partner Kiyone Makibi, an ambitious rookie who worries that being paired with the hapless Mihoshi may doom her career. The story follows Mihoshi and Kiyone as they investigate the theft of a powerful energy source called Ultra Energy Matter. In her exaggerated retelling, Mihoshi inserts her Earth friends Tenchi, Ayeka, Sasami and the others into the case, assigning them roles alongside her and Kiyone. Through the investigation full of comical mishaps, the audience catches glimpses of Mihoshi’s past and potential future. While parodying various anime tropes and paying homage to the Tenchi Muyo series, the special ultimately serves to flesh out Mihoshi as a character. We see both her inadequacies and surprising competence as an officer. Kiyone’s presence highlights Mihoshi’s flaws but also the charm that allows her to succeed despite them. Their odd couple partnership points to further misadventures for the ditzy but good-hearted Mihoshi.",
