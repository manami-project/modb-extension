    "text": "Little time has passed in Tokyo since Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu last visited the magical land of Cephiro. Still haunted by memories of their quest to save Princess Emeraude, the three friends reunite and wish to return to Cephiro to aid the kingdom they once protected. Their desire is answered in spectacular fashion when a brilliant light transports them back atop Tokyo Tower. In Cephiro, the Magic Knights discover a land in ruins without the Pillar's power - monsters roam freely while neighboring countries seek to conquer the vulnerable territory. Making matters worse is the mysterious Lady Debonair who claims to be Cephiro's rightful ruler. Facing grave threats from invading nations and dark magical forces, Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu resolve to once more save Cephiro. Bonded by friendship and duty, the valiant trio stands ready to restore peace despite the great challenges ahead.",
