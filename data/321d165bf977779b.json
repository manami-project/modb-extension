    "text": "The beloved couples from the main series embark on a much-anticipated getaway to a vibrant city, eager to enjoy an overnight stay and a day of sightseeing. However, a mix-up with their room reservations leaves them with only two double rooms, forcing two couples to seek alternative accommodations for the night. As the group splits up, Chizuru and Koh find themselves in an unexpected situation at a love hotel. This special thirteenth episode of 'Nande Koko ni Sensei ga!?' (Why the hell are you here, Teacher!?) unfolds with humor and heart, included as a bonus in the Blu-ray box.",
