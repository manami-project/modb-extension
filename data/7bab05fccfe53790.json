    "text": "They are the heroes of Sternbild, a vibrant city teeming with people of diverse backgrounds and extraordinary abilities known as Next. In this metropolis, corporate sponsorships fuel the exploits of these superheroes, who proudly display their patrons' logos on their costumes. As they conquer catastrophes and save lives, they amass Hero Points, propelling them towards the coveted title of King of Heroes on the popular Hero TV show.\n\nAmong these heroes is Wild Tiger, a seasoned veteran with an unyielding sense of justice and a penchant for recklessness. When his performance begins to falter, Wild Tiger finds himself paired with an unlikely ally: the enigmatic newcomer Barnaby Brooks Jr.\n\nTheir contrasting personalities collide like oil and water, as the frivolous Wild Tiger dubs his serious partner 'Bunny.' Despite their differences, they must learn to cooperate to protect Sternbild City from looming threats and revive their careers. Will their constant friction hinder their progress, or will they rise above their differences to become the world's first successful hero duo? The future of Sternbild City hangs in the balance.",
