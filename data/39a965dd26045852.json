  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Bloodthirsty creatures of the night have long been whispered about in hushed tones, their existence dismissed as mere folklore meant to keep children from venturing into the woods after dark. However, for young Tanjirou, these tales become a brutal reality when he returns home one day to find his family massacred, their lives snuffed out by one of these very demons. The only survivor is his sister Nezuko, who has been transformed into a demon herself, albeit one that retains traces of her humanity.\n\nIn the Taisho era of Japan, Tanjirou, once a humble coal seller, now shoulders the heavy burden of avenging his family and saving his sister. With a heart full of determination and a fierce resolve to protect what remains of his family, Tanjirou embarks on a perilous journey to join the ranks of the legendary Demon Slayers.\n\nIn this chilling tale of love, loss, and courage, Tanjirou must navigate a world fraught with danger and uncertainty. As he battles against the very monsters that have shattered his world, he clings to the hope that he can somehow restore his sister's humanity and reclaim a semblance of the peaceful life they once knew. Will Tanjirou's unwavering spirit and the power of familial love be enough to overcome the darkness that threatens to consume them? Only time will tell in this thrilling adventure of blood, blades, and brotherly love.",
