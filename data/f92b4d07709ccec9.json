  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One sunny day in the idyllic Crescent Moon Forest, a lively young bunny named Chima embarks on a journey filled with laughter, learning, and camaraderie. Joined by her fellow woodland pals – Mallow, Kale, Shallot, Blackberry, and a high-flying squirrel named Hickory – Chima explores the enchanting world around her, uncovering the forest's hidden secrets and engaging in delightful escapades.\n\nWhen Chima's punctuality is the subject of mockery among her friends Gaku, Haru, and even some older rabbits, she can't help but yearn for a kindred spirit closer to her age. As if by magic, her wish is granted when Professor Hoot introduces a new student to the class: Meru, a young bunny just like Chima. United by their shared experiences, the four bunnies – Chima, Gaku, Haru, and Meru – traverse the wonders of Crescent Forest, growing together as they encounter thrilling adventures and the occasional mischief.",
