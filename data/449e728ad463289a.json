    "text": "Mahiru Shirota, a 15-year-old high school student, is a firm believer in keeping life simple and avoiding complications. His life takes an unexpected turn when he rescues a stray cat, Kuro, on his way home from school. Unbeknownst to Mahiru, Kuro is no ordinary feline but a vampire known as a \"Servamp.\" When Mahiru discovers a mysterious young man in his home who transforms into Kuro upon exposure to sunlight, he learns that Kuro is actually a lazy shut-in vampire. Despite Kuro's promise to leave once night falls, a series of unfortunate events lead to Mahiru unintentionally forming a contract with him, plunging him into a dangerous world of supernatural servants and bloodthirsty beings. As one of the seven Servamps representing Inertia, Kuro, also known as Sleepy Ash, must work together with Mahiru to face the impending war against the other Servamps and their eighth sibling, Tsubaki. Say goodbye to his simple life, as Mahiru is thrust into a world where he must navigate the complexities of being a master to a vampire servant.",
