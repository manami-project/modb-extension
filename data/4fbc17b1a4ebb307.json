  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A poor, abandoned black kitten is on the verge of starvation when a vampire takes pity and gives the kitten some of his blood, transforming the kitten into a vampire cat named Nyanpire. Now gifted with fangs, wings, and an eternal yet bloodthirsty life, Nyanpire is adopted by a human girl named Misaki and lives domestically as her housecat, though he still seeks blood. He befriends other eccentric cats in the neighborhood, including Masamunya the samurai cat and Nyantenshi the angel cat, and regularly begs them for blood. Despite the difficulties of being an immortal cat who thirsts for blood, Nyanpire leads a fun, whimsical life with his new owner.",
