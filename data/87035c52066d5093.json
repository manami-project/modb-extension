When a young boy mysteriously transforms into a Piplup creature, he encounters a Chimchar and a Grovyle, forming an unlikely alliance. Together, they set out to the enigmatic 'Lost Continent' to restore the Time Gears and save their world from impending doom.\n\nAs time anomalies plague the land, causing Mystery Dungeons and aggressive Pokémon to appear, exploration teams like Team Pokédans are formed to maintain order. The source of these disruptions is revealed to be the crumbling Temporal Tower and the corruption of Dialga into Dark Dialga. In an attempt to halt the tower's deterioration, the notorious thief Grovyle had stolen the Time Gears to return them to their rightful place.\n\nNow, the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of Team Pokédans – comprising Hikozaru and the once-human Pochama – as they join forces with Grovyle. Their mission: to traverse the treacherous Phantom Land and reach Temporal Tower. If they fail, the tower's collapse will leave the world frozen in time, forever...",
