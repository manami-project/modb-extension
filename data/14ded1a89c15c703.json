    "text": "Deep within the Earth lies the magical Healing Garden, home to Latte and the Healing Animals who have protected the planet for centuries. However, the Healing Garden has been attacked by the evil Bjögens, who aim to infect the garden and poison Earth. To save their home, Latte and three Healing Animal trainees escape to the human world in search of partners. They soon meet Nodoka, Chiyu, and Hinata, three ordinary girls who agree to help defend the planet. Empowered by their new bonds, the girls become Pretty Cure warriors named Cure Grace, Cure Fontaine, and Cure Sparkle. Together with the Healing Animals, the Cures stand as the last line of defense against the Bjögens' toxic plot. Though initially powerless, their determination sparks a transformation that could save both worlds. Now, with little time left, the Healing Garden's final hope rests on whether the Pretty Cure and their animal allies can defeat their infectious foes. Will they triumph and heal the damage already done, or will the Bjögens succeed and doom Earth to their poison? The ultimate battle between purification and pollution is about to begin.",
