  "synopsis": {
    "text": "At the stroke of midnight, an anomalous secret hour called the Dark Hour appears. During this time, most people are trapped unconscious in coffins, while monsters known as Shadows roam freely. A select group of high school students at Gekkoukan High School have the power to summon Personas - special beings used to combat the Shadows. This group, known as SEES (Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad), is on a mission to uncover the mystery behind the Dark Hour and defeat the Shadows once and for all. The story follows Makoto Yuki, a transfer student who moves into Iwatodai Dorm. Shortly after his arrival, his Persona awakens when the dorm is attacked by a powerful Shadow. Recruited into SEES, Makoto joins forces with his fellow students as they fight to protect humanity during the Dark Hour using their Persona abilities. Through their nightly battles, the group hopes to eliminate the threat of Shadows and solve the strange phenomenon of the hidden 25th hour.",
