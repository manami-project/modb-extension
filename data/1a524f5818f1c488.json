    "text": "Kamimine Town, nestled in the eastern part of Saga Prefecture, is steeped in the legends of the formidable military commander, Minamoto no Tametomo, often referred to as 'Yoshitsune in the east, Tametomo in the west.' Adopting the name 'Hachirou Chinzei,' Tametomo constructed a castle in this very town. Chinzei, a towering figure renowned for his archery skills, led his troops to victory against an astounding 50,000 adversaries, leaving behind a legacy of captivating tales. Despite his reputation for a fiery temper and a propensity for violence, Chinzei was also a beacon of warmth and kindness, embodying the essence of humanity. This anime presents a music video tribute to Kamimine Town and its illustrious local legend, the samurai military commander, Minamoto no Tametomo. Additionally, a short film delves into the life of Tametomo, the most powerful military commander of the Genpei era, further highlighting his connection to Kamimine Town.",
