  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This abstract animation follows a young girl caught in a cycle of repetitive moments. As scenes blur together, she murmurs \"Someday this will end. I hate it. I wanna live forever.\" Her existential crisis plays out through visual and auditory wordplay, leaving the viewer to ponder if she is stuck repeating the same instances or if time is actually moving forward. Though details are sparse, the cryptic visuals and haunting refrain capture the feeling of grappling with mortality. Created as a 1st year project in 2015 for the Tokyo University of the Arts' acclaimed animation program, this avant-garde short seems to experiment with time, emotion, and the medium of animation itself. Surreal and thought-provoking, it lingers over the uneasy question of whether we control our fates.",
