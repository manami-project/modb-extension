    "text": "Film student Mio Yamanaka presents a thought-provoking wordplay animation that explores the cyclical nature of life and the desire for immortality. A young girl is heard expressing her fear of endings and her longing to live forever. As the animation unfolds, it becomes unclear whether the girl is reliving the same moments or progressing forward. The animation, produced by Taruto Fuyama and featuring music by Yoshiki Masuda and sound effects by Manami Noda, was created as part of Yamanaka's first-year studies at the Tokyo University of the Arts' Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation. Prepare to be captivated by this introspective and visually stunning piece.",
