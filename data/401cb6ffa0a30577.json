    "text": "Ichimura Tetsunosuke, a young boy haunted by the brutal murder of his parents at the hands of the Choshu, an anti-government faction, yearns for strength and vengeance. At the tender age of 15, he seeks out the Shinsengumi, a formidable shogunal police force, in the hope of joining their ranks. Despite his diminutive stature and lack of skill, Tetsunosuke's determination is unwavering, fueled by the support of his older brother Tatsunosuke and newfound friends within the Shinsengumi. However, the path to vengeance is fraught with bloodshed and pain, as Tetsunosuke must confront the harsh realities of being part of this historic group in late 19th century Kyoto. As he delves deeper into the world of the Shinsengumi, Tetsunosuke must grapple with the possibility of sacrificing his very humanity in exchange for the power to exact revenge. Will he be able to endure the trials ahead and avenge his parents' deaths, or will the price of vengeance prove too steep? Join Tetsunosuke on his harrowing journey in Peacemaker Kurogane, where the lines between justice and revenge blur amidst the chaos of war.",
