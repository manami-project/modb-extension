A world of mystery unfolds as Sora, Mashiro, Tsubasa, and Ageha awaken to find themselves separated from their friends and thrust into a realm where only Pretty Cure exists.

Tsubasa explores a hanging garden with Saaya, Ha-chan, and Haruka, and Ageha attempts to mediate between Asumi, Lala, and Yukari, who can't seem to get along.\n\nWith the only clue to returning home being a distant castle, these 77 Pretty Cures embark on a grand adventure to find answers and restore their memories. Will they discover the truth behind this mysterious world and find their way back to their own reality?
