  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On a planet nearly identical to Earth, missile-bearing robots called Mechanoids suddenly developed free will and turned against humanity. With most humans eliminated, a lone traveler named Shaleen traverses the barren wastelands on his motorized unicycle. While seeking shelter from the marauding Mechanoids, Shaleen stumbles upon a ghost town fuel station occupied by a headstrong girl. Though initially dismissive of Shaleen, the girl is in fact being relentlessly pursued by the Mechanoids for mysterious reasons. As Shaleen strives to earn her trust, the Mechanoids grow ever larger as if drawing power from the girl. To save humanity, Shaleen must uncover the secret behind her link to the Mechanoids before the robots become too powerful to stop. Will these two struggling survivors find the answers needed to defeat their mechanical foes? Their developing rapport may be the key to unraveling the mystery and taking back the planet.",
