  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nikuko is a passionate, easygoing single mother living with her 11-year-old daughter Kikuko on a boat in a small fishing village in northern Japan. Nikuko falls for the wrong men and lives loudly by the motto \"ordinary is best.\" This embarrasses the quiet and reserved Kikuko who is on the cusp of puberty and wants nothing more than to blend in. The mother and daughter seem to have little in common, but both approach life with spirit - Nikuko with her bold and brash attitude, embracing all that comes her way, and Kikuko with her curious imagination and methodical nature as she navigates the dramas of middle school. Their tender relationship faces a sudden challenge when a shocking secret from the past is revealed, threatening to uproot their life together on the boat. Ultimately it is the miracle of their bond and mutual love that allows them to grow together through adversity.",
