  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nissan Skyline GT-R driver Takeshi Nakazato, leader of the Myougi Night Kids, is determined to prove the superiority of grip racing over drift racing by challenging Takumi Fujiwara's Toyota AE86 to a downhill battle. Despite his car's clear advantage, Nakazato is infuriated by the suggestion that he'll never beat Takumi. Reluctant to accept the challenge, Takumi - a high school student and gas station attendant who moonlights as a tofu delivery driver - is goaded into racing by his employer. However, Takumi's father has taken the AE86, leaving Takumi eagerly awaiting its return and feeling the familiar urge to race.\n\nThis film trilogy is based on the initial story from Shuuichi Shigeno's manga, and follows Takumi as he becomes known as the best amateur road racer on Mt. Akina's highway. His exceptional driving skills and his father's modified Toyota Sprinter AE86 Trueno draw challenges from rival racing groups throughout the Gunma prefecture, all eager to test Takumi's abilities.\n\nIn the second part of the trilogy, Takeshi seeks to challenge the increasingly famous Takumi on Akina's slopes. As Takumi grapples with his identity as a racer, he realizes that there's more at stake in these races than just winning or losing.",
