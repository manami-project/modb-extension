  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Risky is a 10 cm tall shinigami apprentice eager to collect souls with her scythe. When sent to the depressed schoolgirl Moe, Risky aims to claim Moe's soul. However, Risky shares her body with Safety, an apprentice angel determined to cheer Moe up. Risky transforms into Safety whenever Moe feels happy, while Sad Moe brings out Risky's shinigami form. As shinigami can only harvest truly despondent souls, Risky struggles to permanently take Moe's soul as Safety keeps uplifting Moe's mood. Moe was driven to despair after the boy she loved showed interest in other girls. The constant shifting between her angelic and grim companions mirrors Moe's flux between hope and sadness. Ultimately, Moe must decide whether to reconcile her love or succumb to sorrow, all while the apprentices Risky and Safety vie for her soul. This lighthearted anime uses visual cuteness over action, focusing on introspection and mood. The series offers a creative take on supernatural apprentices as they balance their dueling goals of protecting or reaping Moe's soul.",
