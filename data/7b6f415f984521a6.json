  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Each day, the tranquility of ancient Japan is disrupted by the resurgence of the Kamikui, malevolent entities that once sowed chaos and devastation. Long ago, the radiant goddess Amaterasu had vanquished these beasts and confined them with a divine seal. However, the seal has now fractured, allowing the Kamikui to roam freely once more.\n\nIn response to this looming threat, a lone Oni rises, determined to combat the miasma of darkness that the Kamikui spread. Joined by a diverse group of eight enchanting and formidable female warriors, each endowed with distinct abilities and vibrant personalities, they embark on a daring quest to eradicate the Kamikui's evil influence.\n\nAmong these valiant heroes is Amaterasu herself, now diminished in power and assuming the form of a young girl following the seal's disintegration. As they navigate through trials and tribulations, their shared experiences forge unbreakable bonds, bolstering their collective strength against the encroaching darkness.\n\nJoin this dynamic ensemble as they traverse mystical Japan, battling legendary creatures and fortifying their alliances. Their journey may be fraught with peril, but with unity and determination, they strive to restore harmony to their world and vanquish the Kamikui once and for all.",
