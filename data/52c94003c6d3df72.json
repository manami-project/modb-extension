  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Nerima Daikon Brothers is a comedic anime about a musical trio with big dreams but little money. The band consists of Hideki, the boisterous leader; his cousin Mako, an attractive but vain woman; and Hideki's stoic brother Ichiro. Together they run a radish farm in the town of Nerima while aspiring to build their own concert dome so their band can perform and hopefully gain fame. Lacking the funds to make their dreams a reality, the Nerima Daikon Brothers resort to chasing get-rich-quick schemes that typically involve defeating evil-doers and stealing their ill-gotten money. However, despite foiling many villains, they always end up losing the money in the end. They receive gadget assistance from a rental shop owner named Nabeshin, but their antics draw the attention of the local policewoman Yukika Karakuri. Undeterred by failures or police interference, the Nerima Daikon Brothers continue hatching outrageous plans to strike it rich, motivated by their boundless passion for music and dreams of sold-out shows. They get into all sorts of absurd and humorous situations as they try to raise money through part-time jobs, battling slimy producers, greedy pachinko parlor owners, wicked nurses, and other oddball foes. Their journey is filled with energetic singing and offbeat comedy.",
