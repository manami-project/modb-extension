  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows a young girl who finds herself relocated from the bustling city to a tranquil countryside school due to her father's job. Struggling to connect with her new classmates, she finds herself longing for her old city life. Among her new peers, there's a boy who piques her interest, but fear of his potential reaction keeps her from reaching out. Just as she begins to despise her new rural existence, an unexpected encounter with a genuine wind deity turns her world upside down. This enchanting tale, part of the Anime Tamago 2016 young animator training projects, beautifully captures the fears, kindness, and love of children in a heartwarming and fleeting fairy tale. The girl's brief stay in the countryside becomes anything but ordinary as she navigates through her new reality and the local legends of the wind spirit Matasaburou.",
