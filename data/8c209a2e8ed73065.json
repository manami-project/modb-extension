    "text": "To protect his demonic step-sisters, Mio and Maria Naruse, Basara Toujou finds himself in a reversed master-servant contract, becoming their master instead of their servant. As the last descendant of a hero clan known for fighting demons, Basara's life takes an unexpected turn as he now defends the very beings he was destined to fight.\n\nWhile attempting to live a normal life and prepare for an upcoming sports event, the trio is ambushed by magic-wielding humans. As Basara strives to become stronger, he is confronted with the sudden arrival of Rukia, Maria's sister. Unbeknownst to them, the war that will determine the fate of the demon realm has already begun.\n\nAs political tension within the demon realm rises, a messenger summons Mio to the demon realm, forcing Basara and his friends to navigate dangerous new territory. In order to protect everyone and overcome seemingly insurmountable challenges, Basara must harness his power through unconventional means, such as erotic pleasure. Follow Basara as he embarks on a thrilling, action-packed journey filled with desire, danger, and unexpected twists.",
