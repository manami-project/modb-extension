  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime's third and fourth films bring the thrill of international soccer to the forefront, expanding the classic Japan-Europe rivalry into a global spectacle. In the third movie, a world cup is organized featuring four formidable teams: Japan, USA, a unified Europe, and a combined South American squad. Japan effortlessly triumphs over the USA in the opening match, while South America narrowly defeats Europe in the second. The final round introduces South America's seemingly invincible 'soccer cyborg', Carlos Santana. Despite Japan's initial struggles against Santana, they learn to synchronize their play and ultimately secure victory.\n\nIn the fourth film, the stage is set in Los Angeles for a junior world championship featuring the same four teams. The Japanese team, led by their captain Tsubasa Ohzora, faces off against the host country, USA, at the tournament's start. However, the competition is far from predictable, with each team harboring unexpected surprises and familiar faces reemerging.  The thrilling matches and intense rivalries promise to keep viewers on the edge of their seats.",
