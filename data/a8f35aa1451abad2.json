    "text": "Having a middle school nemesis isn't uncommon, but for Nishikata, his daily battle is not against a bully, but against the teasing antics of his classmate, Takagi-san. Seated next to each other, Takagi-san finds endless amusement in embarrassing Nishikata, leaving him red-faced and determined to retaliate. Despite his daily attempts to outsmart her, Nishikata finds himself outwitted at every turn, fueling his desire to make Takagi-san blush in embarrassment just once. As the playful war of wits continues, will Nishikata ever succeed in his quest, or will he discover a deeper connection with his teasing adversary?",
