  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kazune is a town shrouded in mystery, where supernatural events and unexplained disappearances are commonplace. Years ago, a young Makoto was forced to leave Kazune, saying goodbye to his childhood friend Minamo. He gifted her a harmonica and extracted a promise that they would meet again someday and marry. Now, Makoto returns to Kazune with his sister Hinata after their mother mysteriously vanished. Attending high school, Makoto hears a familiar harmonica melody one day, drawing him to the roof. Emerging from the fog is Minamo, the girl from his memories. Though older, their bond still remains. Makoto, Minamo and their friends Hinata and Tsutomu happily attend school together, slowly unraveling the disturbing secrets of their supernatural hometown. They discover ties between the mystical energies in Kazune, the unexplained murders happening around them, and their own pasts. What they find will irrevocably change their lives and challenge the promise made long ago between two childhood friends.",
