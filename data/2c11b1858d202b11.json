    "text": "Ash Lynx is a 17-year-old gang leader living on the streets of New York City. As a child, he was kidnapped and abused by mafia boss Dino Golzine. Now Ash investigates the mysterious drug \"Banana Fish\"â€”the same words muttered by his older brother Griffin after returning from war in Iraq. Ash's investigation crosses paths with Eiji Okumura, a kind-hearted Japanese photographer sent to America to document street gangs. However, their first meeting is interrupted when Dino's men attack, looking to reclaim Ash. In the chaos, Eiji and Ash's friend Skip are kidnapped. As Ash tries to rescue his friends and uncover more about Banana Fish, he uncovers a global conspiracy tied to unexplained deaths and suicides amongst veterans. With the help of Eiji, Ash works to get to the bottom of this mystery and stop the spread of this dangerous drug. But Ash's traumatic past and enemies like the mafia, the Chinese triad, and even the U.S. army stand in his way.",
