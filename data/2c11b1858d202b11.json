At the tender age of 17, Ash finds himself entangled in a web of danger and mystery surrounding the enigmatic term \"Banana Fish.\" This phrase, frequently muttered by his troubled brother Griffin, connects to a series of inexplicable deaths during the Iraq War and a recent wave of bizarre suicides in the city.\n\nAsh's life takes an unexpected turn when he encounters Eiji, a kind-hearted Japanese photographer, who becomes an invaluable ally in his quest for the truth.
