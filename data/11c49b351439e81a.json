    "text": "Duel Monsters is set to undergo a revolutionary change with the introduction of 'Rush Duels' in the futuristic town of Gouha. Yuuga Oudou, a fifth-grader with a passion for inventions and dueling, finds the current dueling rules monotonous and restrictive. To bring excitement back to the game, Yuuga introduces Rush Duels, a faster and more thrilling version of the traditional duels. Along with his classmates Luke, the self-proclaimed top duelist at Gouha 7 Elementary School, and Romin, Yuuga embarks on a mission to popularize Rush Duels. Gakuto, the student council president, and Tatsuhisa Kamijou, a fellow elementary school student, also play significant roles in Yuuga's quest. As Yuuga and his friends strive to establish Rush Duels as the new standard, they must navigate the watchful eye of the Gouha Corporation, which oversees the city and the game's rules. With the corporation's disapproval looming, Yuuga remains determined to bring his vision of a more entertaining and engaging dueling experience to life.",
