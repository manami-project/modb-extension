  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This delightful anime introduces us to three charming ghosts named There, Here, and Where, who defy the typical ghostly stereotypes. Instead of being eerie, they are adorable and mischievous, much like human children. Living harmoniously among humans, they form friendships with children and engage in a variety of amusing escapades. Each episode is divided into two acts, with each act narrating a different story about these endearing spectral beings. Among them is Sally, a playful ghost residing with her Grandma Jones in a candy store. Then there's Bumper, a culinary enthusiast who works in a restaurant kitchen. Lastly, we have Cutter, who is employed in a barbershop. Despite occasionally startling people with their ability to vanish or fly, these ghosts are cherished as friends by the children around them.",
