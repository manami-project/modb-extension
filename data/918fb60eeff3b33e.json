    "text": "Hitomi is a depressed teenage girl who wishes to fade away from the pain of her daily life. Her desire resonates across worlds, summoning the mysterious Lord Folken who transports her to the mystical land of Gaea. There, she is revered as the legendary Wing Goddess who can summon the ancient dragon armor Escaflowne. Hitomi's fate becomes intertwined with the hot-headed young King Van, sole survivor of the White Dragon Clan which was destroyed by their sworn enemies, the Black Dragon Clan. Fueled by vengeance, Van lives only for his quest to defeat the Black Dragons who ruined his kingdom. The arrival of the Wing Goddess marks a turning point in Gaea's war-torn history. By summoning the mythical Escaflowne, Hitomi now holds the power to decide the future of Gaea with her heart's desire. Will her choice bring salvation or destruction across this war-ravaged land?",
