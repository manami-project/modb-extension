    "text": "Mijikamon, the chibi spin-off of Barakamon, offers delightful 2-minute specials that aired exclusively on YouTube in Japan following each episode of the main series. These specials feature Naru and Seishuu, along with some special guests, engaging in light-hearted discussions on a variety of topics - from Naru's fascination with cicada shells to the challenges of being a chibi character with an oversized head. Even before the main series began, Mijikamon Episode 0 served as an enticing teaser for fans.",
