  "synopsis": {
    "text": "My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission is a feature film in the popular superhero anime franchise. Bonus animation was included in the \"Plus Ultra\" Blu-ray/DVD release of the film in Japan. This extra animation adapts a Hawks-focused side story manga titled \"No.XXX Hawks: SOOTHE\", originally published in the \"Volume World Heroes\" booklet. This booklet was distributed in theaters during My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission's initial theatrical run as a gift for moviegoers. By bringing the \"No.XXX Hawks: SOOTHE\" manga to life, the bonus animation offers fans more backstory on the pro hero Hawks. It also rewards viewers who saw My Hero Academia: World Heroes' Mission in theaters. The OVA aims to expand the movie's worldbuilding while showcasing dynamic animation and fan-favorite characters.",
