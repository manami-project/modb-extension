    "text": "Sageâ€”a second profession that capitalizes on such potential. Even after gaining overwhelming strength, the scars from the life Yuuji left behind keep him from going all out. However, he might not be able to hide his abilities for much longer, as unforeseen dangers threaten to destroy the world that is now his only home.\n\nIn the relentless grind of corporate life, Yuji Sano finds himself mysteriously transported to a fantastical realm while working late at home. Initially believing it to be a dream, Yuji soon discovers that he has been reincarnated as a Monster Tamer, a class ill-suited for adventuring. However, his fortunes change when he befriends a group of slimes, enabling him to learn magic and unlock a second class: the powerful Sage. Despite his newfound strength, Yuji remains oblivious to the extent of his abilities, preferring to focus on his new life. Yet, as threats loom on the horizon, will Yuji be able to harness his power to protect his new home?",
