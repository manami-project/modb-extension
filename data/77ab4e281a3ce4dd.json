  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Qu Tong and Wei Yang are high school students struggling to live normal lives despite having families obsessed with otaku culture. Qu Tong's enthusiastic father forces her into embarrassing cosplay outfits, while Wei Yang's sister draws questionable yaoi artwork of him and his male friend Ye Shi, encouraged by their fujoshi mother. Though Qu Tong has been immersed in otaku media since childhood, she now rejects it in an attempt to fit in. However, her classmate and crush Yang Wei shatters her image of him as a pure and innocent \"idol\" when she overhears him use the term \"fujoshi.\" This comedy explores the generation gap between otaku parents projecting their interests onto their children, and teenagers trying to discover their own identities amidst familial expectations and social pressures. Qu Tong aims to distance herself from otaku culture while Yang Wei hides his own participation in it, leading to hilarious reveals and reflections on authentic self-expression versus keeping up appearances.",
