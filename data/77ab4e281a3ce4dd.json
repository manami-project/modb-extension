  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yang Wei and Qu Tong, two high school students, grapple with the eccentricities of their otaku-obsessed families as they navigate the trials of adolescence. Qu Tong's father, eager to share his passion for cosplay, pressures her to don embarrassing costumes, while Yang Wei's sister, under the tutelage of their fujoshi mother, sketches dubious images of him with his friend Ye Shi.\n\nTong Qi, raised in a household steeped in otaku culture, strives to distance herself from it, idolizing her classmate, Yang Wei, who she perceives as a beacon of normalcy. However, her world is turned upside down when she hears the term 'fujoshi' from her revered idol.\n\nIn a world where otaku parents and their less enthusiastic offspring collide, Tong Qi, who admires her classmate Yang Wei for his perceived innocence, is taken aback when she discovers his familiarity with the term 'Yaoi'. Brace yourself for a rollercoaster ride of laughter and self-discovery in this anime that explores the dynamic between anime-loving parents and their uninterested children.",
