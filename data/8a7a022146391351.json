  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hideyori Toyotomi, son of the late unifier of Japan, Hideyoshi Toyotomi, is embroiled in a conflict with the powerful Tokugawa clan, threatening the fragile peace that had finally been achieved after centuries of civil war. The regional warlords, who had survived the bloodshed, are now ready for one final showdown, where alliances can shift as swiftly as the wind, and only the most cunning can hope to survive.\n\nIn the heart of this chaos, two brothers from the Sanada household find themselves on opposing sides of the impending battle. The elder, Nobuyuki, stands with the Tokugawa, while the younger, Yukimura, remains loyal to the Toyotomi. As the stalemate at the Odawara Castle, guarded by the 'Lion of Sagami' Ujiyasu Houjou, begins to crumble, Yukimura charges into the fray on a lone horse, followed closely by his brother.\n\nThe anime, Samurai Warriors, focuses on the Sanada brothers during this tumultuous Sengoku era of Japan, where the battlefield is a treacherous place, and the line between friend and foe is blurred. As the final conflict approaches, the shrewdest and bravest will determine the fate of Japan.",
