  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They say the 90s were a time of prosperity, and in Osteandel City, that statement couldn't be more accurate. Nestled within the bustling metropolis lies Time Lease, a thriving business that caters to every whim, from the mundane to the extraordinary, including the provision of formidable robots. Boasting an unbroken streak of ten years at the pinnacle of the international billionaire rankings, Time Lease is the epitome of success.\n\nBut beneath the city's glossy veneer, a sinister organization lurks. Skull Lease, a rival lease company, is home to an infamous trio of villains masquerading as top executives. Their publicly declared goal? To tarnish Time Lease's impeccable reputation and claim the top spot for themselves. However, this is merely a smokescreen for their true ambition: world domination.\n\nWhen a seemingly routine day at Time Lease is disrupted by an assault on one of their transport robots, an unsuspecting hero is thrust into the fray. Enter Ippatsuman, a beacon of justice poised to challenge the villainous trio and restore order to Osteandel City. Will Ippatsuman rise to the occasion and thwart their nefarious schemes? Only time will tell.",
