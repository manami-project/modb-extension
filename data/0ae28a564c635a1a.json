  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Thus begins the chaotic high school life of Tsuda Takatoshi at the recently co-ed Ousai Academy, where he finds himself outnumbered by a staggering ratio of 28 boys to 524 girls. On his first day, he is coerced into joining the student council as the vice president, becoming the only male member among three eccentric and unconventional girls. The student council president, Shino Amakusa, appears to be a strict disciplinarian but hides a perverted side, constantly making lewd jokes and innuendos. Aria Shichijou, the secretary, seems like a typical wealthy and sheltered girl, but her raunchy humor rivals that of the president. Lastly, the diminutive treasurer, Suzu Hagimura, struggles with her height but boasts an impressive IQ of 180. Surrounded by these peculiar girls, Takatoshi must navigate through the absurdity and hilarity of his new role, all while dealing with the misconceptions and stereotypes that come with being one of the few boys in the school.",
