  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As Tokyo enters its third year under the shadow of an alien mothership, the once extraordinary has become mundane. The Japanese Self Defense Forces, desperate for a solution, are considering unconventional methods to combat the extraterrestrial threat, as traditional weaponry has proven futile. Meanwhile, Kadode Koyama, a high school student, navigates her everyday life with her best friend, monitoring the aliens' activities on social media while juggling the pressures of college entrance exams. Amidst the looming apocalypse, they learn to appreciate life one day at a time, even as they grapple with the harsh realities of adulthood in a world where humanity's greatest enemy may not be the invaders overhead, but the demons within. This is the first film in the Dead Dead Demon's Dededededestruction duology, a poignant exploration of life, friendship, and survival in the face of unprecedented adversity.",
