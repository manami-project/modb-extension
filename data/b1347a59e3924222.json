    "text": "Ao Haru Ride follows Futaba Yoshioka, a girl who hated boys in middle school but begins to question that outlook when she meets Kou Tanaka. Though shy at first, Kou and Futaba form a connection through brief encounters and furtive glances. The first OVA episode flashes back to their awkward middle school days when that bond first formed. Despite her distaste for boys, Futaba finds herself intrigued by the unusually gentle Kou, hinting at early romantic feelings between the two. The second OVA fast-forwards to high school, where Futaba attends a summer festival with friends. There she watches in dismay as the assertive Yuuri Makita actively tries getting close to Kou. Threatened by their growing intimacy, Futaba grapples with her own feelings for Kou and questions if she'll ever make progress with him. Centered on young romance and personal growth, Ao Haru Ride depicts Futaba overcoming her biases, navigating new relationships, and maturing from girl to woman. Along the way, she discovers that the boy she once despised may actually be the one she comes to love.",
