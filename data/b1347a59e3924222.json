    "text": "Makita Yuuri's bold move to wear a yukata at a summer festival threatens to disrupt the delicate balance between Futaba Yoshioka and Kou Tanaka in the second episode of \"Ao Haru Ride OAD.\" As Futaba watches from a distance, she struggles to find a way to assert herself in the face of Yuuri's advances. Meanwhile, the first episode takes us back to Futaba and Kou's middle school days, where we see the beginnings of their complicated relationship. Despite her general dislike of boys, Futaba finds herself drawn to the quiet and reserved Kou, who seems to be different from the others. As they navigate their awkward first encounters, Futaba must come to terms with her growing feelings for Kou and figure out what they mean for her future.",
