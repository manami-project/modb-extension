    "text": "In the occult-obsessed Akito Kobayashi's quest for power, a sinister plan is hatched to unleash demonic forces upon Tokyo. Once a lonely outcast, Kobayashi has grown into an arrogant teenager who has developed a mysterious computer program to control demons using magnetite, the essence of human life. When Kobayashi's former elementary school friend Kojiro Soma sees him unexpectedly enroll in his high school, Kojiro begins witnessing frightening supernatural events surrounding his classmates. He comes to realize Kobayashi's apocalyptic vision to bring hell upon the city by harvesting his classmates' magnetite to strengthen his demons. As the evil forces spiral out of Kobayashi's control, Kojiro discovers he may be the only one with the dormant power to confront the increasingly unstable Kobayashi. Kojiro is forced to delve into his own metaphysical strengths in an ultimate showdown against Kobayashi's strongest demon legion to save his friends and Tokyo itself.",
