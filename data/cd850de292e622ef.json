Eager to start anew and find love, his dreams are dashed on the first day of school. However, his mundane life takes a dramatic turn when he and his best friend, Ginnosuke Isuzu, stumble upon a mysterious underground world hidden beneath Tokyo.\n\nThis subterranean city is home to Elemental Users, individuals with the extraordinary ability to control natural elements such as fire, water, lightning, and more. Among these unique inhabitants are Chelsea Rorec, a Gravity User, and Ruri Sarasa, the revered Miko of Life, both of whom have escaped from the clutches of the secretive organization known as The Company.\n\nUpon meeting Chelsea and Ruri, Rumina vows to protect them from their relentless pursuers, even as he grapples with the revelation of his own latent power over wind. As he navigates this hidden world teeming with elemental adversaries, Rumina must grow stronger to safeguard his newfound friends and prevent the impending chaos threatening to engulf the surface world.
