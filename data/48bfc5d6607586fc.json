    "text": "Harry Champ may dominate the Zoid battles, but there's a new team on the rise: the Blitz Team, led by Bit Cloud and his powerful Liger Zero. On the planet Zi, Zoids, once used for warfare, are now utilized for sporting events overseen by the Zoid Battle Commission. As the Blitz Team competes against other skilled pilots, they must also face the criminal Backdraft Group, who will stop at nothing to obtain the Liger Zero for their own nefarious purposes. Bit Cloud and his team must protect their Zoid and each other as they strive to become the best in the league. In a world where powerful animal-shaped robots determine victory, the Blitz Team just might have what it takes to emerge triumphant.",
