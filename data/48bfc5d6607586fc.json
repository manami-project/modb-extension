    "text": "On the planet Zi, Zoids were once used for military combat but now participate in organized sporting competitions known as Zoid battles, overseen by the Zoid Battle Commission. The Blitz Team, a scrappy group of pilots led by Bit Cloud and his temperamental yet powerful Liger Zero Zoid, seek to rise through the ranks of competitors. They face regular rivals as well as the Backdraft Group, a shady criminal organization trying to steal the Liger Zero to add to their illegal roster of Zoids. Alongside teammates like Harry Champ, Bit and the Blitz Team take on all challengers with hopes of one day being crowned champions. Though the road is difficult, their passion for the sport and bond as a team spur them ever forward.",
