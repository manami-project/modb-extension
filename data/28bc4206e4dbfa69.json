    "text": "Can love bloom amidst intergalactic warfare? After the obliteration of their home planet, the Barmian survivors, led by the ruthless Olban, set their sights on Earth as their new sanctuary. However, negotiations crumble when their leader is assassinated, and the Earth delegation is falsely accused. As the Barmians unleash mechanical terrors upon Earth, the planet's last hope lies in the powerful, karate-wielding robot Daimos, piloted by Kazuya Ryuuzaki. Amidst the chaos, Kazuya crosses paths with the enigmatic Erika, igniting a forbidden love that transcends the boundaries of their warring worlds. As Richter, Erika's brother and the mastermind behind the Barmian onslaught, intensifies his attacks, Kazuya and Erika's love is tested. Will their bond be strong enough to unite their peoples, or will it be consumed by the flames of war? Only time will reveal the fate of Earth and the star-crossed lovers caught in the middle.",
