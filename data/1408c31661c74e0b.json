  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Pikotaro, a quirky singer-songwriter, finds himself transported into the worlds of classic fairy tales in his dreams. Guided by illustrations from director Taniguchi, Pikotaro ad-libs his way through three-minute, scriptless retellings of tales like The Little Match Girl, Cinderella, and The Ugly Duckling. With his offbeat humor and tendency to dispense questionable advice, Pikotaro shakes up these timeless stories. Whether interrupting the Ugly Duckling's argument with soup or rocking out with Cinderella in her pumpkin carriage, his madcap antics inject absurdity and surprise into the fairy tale formula. By voicing all the characters himself, Pikotaro stamps his signature style on the stories. His unique comedic flair aims to both entertain viewers and lull them into amusingly strange dreams. By bringing his viral creativity to classics loved worldwide, Pikotaro breaks new ground in the fairy tale genre with these bedtime stories made to rock audiences to sleep.",
