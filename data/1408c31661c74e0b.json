    "text": "Riding the wave of innovation, Pikotaro, a singer-songwriter from Chiba, presents a unique twist on classic fairy tales, drawing inspiration from the captivating illustrations of director Taniguchi. In this three-minute, scriptless anime series, Pikotaro takes center stage, lending his voice to all characters, including himself. Brace yourself for a whimsical journey as Pikotaro interacts with beloved fairy tale characters such as The Little Match Girl, Cinderella, and The Ugly Duckling in his dreams, offering questionable advice, impromptu serenades, and even mediating squabbles with unconventional methods. These unforgettable bedtime stories are guaranteed to lull you into a delightfully absurd slumber. (Source: Reinterpreted)",
