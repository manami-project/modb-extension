    "text": "Perfect Religion Academy, a prestigious high school, welcomes its newest student, Mari Amachi, a devout Christian girl known for her innocence and shyness. When her best friend, Saori Minami, falls prey to the nefarious Black Buddha gang, Mari turns to her faith for help. However, it's not the Virgin Mary but Buddha himself who answers her prayers, offering her an unusual solution.\n\nBuddha bestows upon Mari the power to transform into Gōtaman, a magical girl with a twist. Forget the frills and wands; Gōtaman wields a magical sumo loincloth, using her mighty posterior to combat evil. Despite her initial reluctance, Mari agrees to embrace this unconventional role to save her friend.\n\nAs Gōtaman, Mari's strength amplifies with each tightening of her sumo belt, making her a formidable opponent against the Black Buddha gang. Even the menacing Darth Veda is no match for her powerful derriere. Will Mari overcome her embarrassment and harness the power of her unique attire to uphold justice and religious freedom? Join her on this extraordinary journey of faith, friendship, and butt-kicking action!",
