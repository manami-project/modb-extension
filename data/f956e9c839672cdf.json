  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuusuke, Mikan, and their seemingly ordinary parents form the Tachibana family, a group that finds themselves in the throes of hilarious escapades and unconventional situations. As they navigate through everyday life in Japan, the Tachibanas encounter a series of side-splitting misadventures that range from heated discussions about high-end bento boxes to the trials and tribulations of shopping excursions.\n\nThe Tachibana household, comprised of a dedicated salaryman father, a resourceful housewife mother, and their two spirited teenagers, is anything but mundane. With Mikan and her mother's antics, such as testing peculiar exercise equipment or attempting to persuade mom to invest in a new air conditioner, each day is filled with laughter and amusement. Join the Tachibanas as they revel in the delightful absurdity of their daily lives, proving that 'normal' is truly relative.",
