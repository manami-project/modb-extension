    "text": "Twelve years have passed since we last saw Hiroyuki, Akari, and their close group of friends. Though now high school seniors, some things never change - their friendship remains strong as ever. However, they are surprised when their dear friend Multi, the humanlike android, suddenly reappears at their school after years apart. Unfortunately, Multi has lost all her memories and no longer recognizes her caring companions. Seeing Multi again sparks nostalgia as well as sadness over her memory loss. Still, Hiroyuki, Akari, and friends are determined to rebuild their special bond. By reliving meaningful moments and creating new memories together, they hope to help Multi regain her lost recollections. Their patience and support highlights the depth of their connection. This heartwarming story explores the themes of friendship, memory, and humanlike artificial intelligence. As we witness Multi reintegrating into the lives of those who cherish her most, we are reminded of the power of unconditional love and support.",
