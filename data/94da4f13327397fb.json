    "text": "Mohwa is a shaman who has practiced her craft for her entire life while living with her mute daughter Nang-Yi and husband. Her world is upended when her son, Wook-Yi, returns home after being away for years, now a converted Christian. Mohwa and Wook-Yi's differing spiritual beliefs drive a wedge between mother and son, sparking a conflict that ultimately ends in tragedy for the family. In the aftermath, the grief-stricken Nang-Yi channels her pain into a mysterious painting depicting her mother's life as a shaman sorceress. Though the family is torn apart, Nang-Yi's art immortalizes her mother's spiritual legacy and the bittersweet story of their family.",
