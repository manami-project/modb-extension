    "text": "Mega-Float City, Bayron, a metropolis floating in the Pacific Ocean, is the epicenter of a new energy source known as Orgonium, attracting global attention. While the city promises a luxurious lifestyle, young entrepreneur Shuu Ogata struggles to make ends meet due to his reckless spending. Running a private military company, Shuu's mission is to combat the increasing demon-related incidents, known as D Hazards, that plague the city.\n\nAiding Shuu in his mission is Kisara, a high school student with a hidden identity: she's a demon. Bound by a contract sealed with a kiss, Kisara supports Shuu both in his professional and personal life, sometimes a little too forcefully for his liking. However, their bond wavers between love and obligation, leaving their future uncertain.\n\nAdding to the mix is Ayano, Shuu's ex-girlfriend and former colleague at a major PMC. Despite their past, Ayano still harbors feelings for Shuu, creating a complex web of relationships. As Shuu, Kisara, and Ayano navigate their personal lives, they must also confront the escalating demon threats lurking in the shadows of Bayron City. The true cost of their demon extermination efforts remains a secret, one that could alter their destinies forever.",
