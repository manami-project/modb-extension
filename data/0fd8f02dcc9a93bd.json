    "text": "He edless of the U.S. government's orders for retreat, special agent Leon S. Kennedy delves deeper into the chaos of a war-torn Eastern European nation in \"Resident Evil: Damnation\". The chilling sequel to \"Biohazard: Degeneration\", this CG animation feature is rooted in the popular Resident Evil game series.\n\nAs whispers of Bio Organic Weapons (B.O.W.s) being unleashed in the conflict grow louder, Leon's mission to verify these rumors morphs into a desperate quest to halt the devastating chain of B.O.W.-induced calamities. Upon arrival, he barely escapes an encounter with a grotesque Licker mutant, only to find himself entangled in the crossfire of a civil war, where both factions ruthlessly vie for control over the Las Plagas virus.\n\nIn this treacherous landscape, Leon crosses paths with the enigmatic Ada Wong, who harbors her own intentions for obtaining a sample of the virus. Despite their differing motives, circumstances align them as temporary allies in a battle against the escalating biohazard threat. As they navigate the dangers of a nation on the brink, the duo must confront the horrifying consequences of the Las Plagas virus and work together to prevent a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions.",
