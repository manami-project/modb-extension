    "text": "Sakugawa Middle School student Ruiko Saten, despite her Level 0 esper status, finds herself in the midst of extraordinary adventures in the technologically-advanced Academy City. Alongside her best friend, Kazari Uiharu, a Level 1 esper and skilled hacker, they join forces with Tokiwadai's high-level espers, Mikoto Misaka and Kuroko Shirai. Mikoto, the third-ranked Level 5 Electro-master, and Kuroko, a teleporting Level 4, work together in Judgment, the city's student-led law enforcement agency, to combat the rising tide of crime fueled by the emergence of the Level Upper, a mysterious device rumored to increase one's esper level. As the friends navigate their way through the city's dark underbelly, they uncover a series of strange urban legends and confront powerful adversaries, all while learning the true value of friendship and the importance of using their powers responsibly. With their unique abilities and unbreakable bonds, the group strives to maintain order in the chaotic, ever-evolving Academy City.",
