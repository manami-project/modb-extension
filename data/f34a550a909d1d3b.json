  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Boro the Caterpillar hatches from an egg into a suburban grove in Japan, just before dawn. As he looks around with fascination at his new world, he notices the brilliance of the morning sun and senses deliciousness in the air. When the sun lights up the grove, Boro watches the leaves begin to photosynthesize and remarks joyfully on the great taste of the air and water. Though small, he steps out to face many trials - hungry predators, harsh weather, and more. To humans, his world seems tiny, but to Boro the obstacles he must overcome on his journey through the wilderness are enormous. This film combines computer graphics and hand-drawn animation to portray the untamed world as seen through the eyes of an insect, with all sound effects created by a famous Japanese comedian. It marks acclaimed director Hayao Miyazaki's first CG film for the Ghibli Museum, made to transport viewers into the fascination and wonder of a caterpillar's first steps in life.",
