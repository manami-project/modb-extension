  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nutsberry Town is a quaint rural town surrounded by natural beauty, detached from modern distractions. It's here that Snappy the Onion, Wendy the Walnut, and Pee Wee the Peanut - known as the \"Kooky Kids\" - play their good-natured pranks and embark on fun adventures together. Though never malicious, their mischief still lands them in amusing trouble. With wholesome old-fashioned values, Nutsberry Town provides a nostalgic backdrop. The Kooky Kids pass the time through imagination and enjoying the shimmering lakes, forests, and green fields around them since video games and malls are scarce. Originally a 1950s-60s puppet show, this series returns to tap into parents' fond memories. But the Kooky Kids' lighthearted antics amidst Nutsberry Town's bucolic charm give the show an enduring, multi-generational appeal.",
