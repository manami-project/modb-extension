  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's time to escape to the idyllic charm of Nutsberry Town, a picturesque countryside haven nestled among sparkling lakes, verdant forests, and vibrant fields. This quaint town, steeped in timeless values, serves as the playground for our delightful trio of heroes: Snappy the Onion, Wendy the Walnut, and Pee Wee the Peanut, better known as the 'Kooky Kids.'\n\nThe Kooky Kids, fueled by their boundless curiosity and thirst for excitement, embark on endless escapades that often lead to mischief. Despite their penchant for trouble, these loveable characters never harbor any ill intentions or malice. Instead, their antics are born from a pure desire for fun and adventure in a town that lacks the distractions of modern-day amusements like video arcades, shopping malls, or theme parks.\n\nInspired by the nostalgic charm of Chirorin Mura To Kurumi No Ki, a beloved children's puppet show from yesteryears, this anime rekindles the spirit of innocent exploration and imagination. Join the Kooky Kids as they transform their serene surroundings into a playground of endless possibilities, reminding us that sometimes, the best adventures are found right in our own backyard.",
