  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shonen Sunday presents the final chapter in Gorou Shigeno's baseball saga, as the Indiana Hornets gear up for the coveted World Series. In a fateful match against a formidable rival, Gorou's aspirations of becoming the world's greatest pitcher are put to the test when an unforeseen accident befalls him. Refusing to let this setback deter him, Gorou channels his dreams and determination into every fastball he throws, propelling himself towards his destiny.\n\nThis original video anime project, helmed by Mitsuda Takuya, brings the unadapted World Series arc to life, culminating in the elusive final showdown. Fans will finally bear witness to the last pitch in the manga and the triumphant return of the legendary 'Golden Battery' on American soil. The December release of this ultimate Major OVA marks the end of an era, as it animates the previously unseen World Series chapter and concludes the series with a bang.",
