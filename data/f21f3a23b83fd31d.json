  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takeshi and Kentaro are lifelong friends living in a seaside city with a mysterious star lake created by an ancient meteorite. One night, a strange purple monster emerges from the lake and begins attacking people. At the same time, Takeshi and Kentaro receive a message from a being named Kopuu explaining that the monster is a minion of the ancient evil Gomon, who plans to plunge the world into darkness after awakening from his long slumber. Kopuu reveals Takeshi and Kentaro as the chosen heroes with the power to transform into Barom One, a powerful warrior of justice and friendship able to defeat Gomon's monsters. Though unsure of their new role, the bonds of loyalty and camaraderie between the two friends could be the key to accessing Barom One's incredible strength. With the purple slime creature wreaking havoc and Gomon gathering power, Takeshi and Kentaro race against time to transform into Barom One and stand against the rising dark forces that threaten their city and the entire world.",
