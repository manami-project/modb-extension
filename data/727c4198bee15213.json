  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ami Kurata is a clumsy yet earnest first-year college student who unexpectedly falls head over heels for a folding bicycle she spots outside a train station. Inspired, she empties her savings to buy one for herself. This purchase opens up the exciting world of cycling and Ami soon acquires a lightweight road bike that allows her to ride faster and farther than ever before. Alongside four fellow female students, Ami forms a campus cycling team called Fortuna. Though inexperienced, the team dreams big, aiming to compete in an upcoming long-distance bicycle race requiring endurance, commitment and an abundance of heart. Despite the sore muscles and occasional falls, Ami persists in her newfound passion, embracing all the highs and lows. With her trusty bicycle by her side, she sets off on a journey of self-discovery, scenic vistas, and lasting friendships forged in the saddle.",
