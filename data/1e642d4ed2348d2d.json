  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers on two anthropomorphic cats, the cheerful calico Tapio Chatorazawa and the pessimistic Russian blue Kuehiko Roshihara. The two felines study together at the same college and also work various odd jobs as partners. Tapio is bursting with energy and optimism. In contrast, Kuehiko often takes a gloomy outlook on life. As the two cats take on jobs like delivering packages or washing towering windows, they learn that work can be both difficult and rewarding. Their experiences also strengthen the bond between this mismatched pair as they endure colorful customers and supervisors. Through their job adventures, Tapio and Kuehiko discover that even seemingly mundane tasks can be fun and meaningful. The anime lightheartedly explores the working world through the eyes of the enthusiastic Tapio and the jaded Kuehiko. Their odd job escapades promise comedic hijinks as well as touching moments of friendship.",
