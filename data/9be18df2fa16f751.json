    "text": "It's a complex predicament for Shougo Mikadono as he navigates the labyrinth of his late father's peculiar will. To claim his vast inheritance and become the head of Mikadono Group, Shougo must find a suitable bride among the many young women at his new school, Miryuin Private Academy. However, there's a twist that could potentially lead to a morally awkward situation: one of these girls is his long-lost sister, separated at birth, and he has no clue who she is. As he interacts with the various girls, including the class representative Konoe Suruma, the kind-hearted Miyabi Kannagi, the student council vice president Rinka Kunitachi, the witch-like Mei Sagara, and the student council president Mana Tendou, he must tread carefully. Can Shougo unravel the mystery of his sister's identity while simultaneously seeking his future wife without crossing any forbidden lines? Only time will tell in this intriguing tale of love, family, and destiny.",
