  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an apocalyptic alternate future, Goku has died prematurely from a deadly virus, leaving the Earth vulnerable. Several months later, two murderous androids appear, destroying cities and taking countless lives without remorse. With most of Earth's warriors slain, all hope seems lost. Goku's son Gohan, now a grown man, emerges as one of the only remaining fighters willing to stand against the mechanical menace. He takes the young half-Saiyan Trunks under his wing, training him in hopes that together they can turn the tide. Outmatched but unrelenting, mentor and protégé vow to fight on despite the world crumbling around them. This is the grim story of a future that never was - one of loss and devastation, but also of hope against impossible odds. Though the shadow of apocalypse looms, Gohan and Trunks may yet find a way to defeat the androids and redeem their shattered world.",
