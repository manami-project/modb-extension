  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Doujin Work centers around Najimi Osana, an unemployed young woman struggling to make ends meet. When her friend Tsuyuri, a successful doujinshi (self-published manga) artist, brings Najimi to a doujin convention, she is awed by the money that can be made in the industry. Inspired, Najimi decides to try her hand at creating her own doujinshi, hoping to build a career and fortune. However, with no experience in doujinshi or even much artistic skill, Najimi quickly realizes the steep learning curve she faces. As she attends more conventions and meets other artists, including her popular childhood friend Justice, Najimi slowly improves while enduring embarrassing mishaps. With the support of her growing circle of friends, as well as new fans and rivals, Najimi is determined to hone her craft until she too can find success as a doujin artist. Ultimately, Doujin Work is a comedic tale of Najimi's bumpy foray into amateur manga publishing as she tries to make her dreams of wealth come true. Along the way, she forms meaningful connections in the doujin community while learning tough lessons about art, business, and life.",
