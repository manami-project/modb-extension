    "text": "Genius wizard Megumin, hailing from the Crimson Demon Village, has a single-minded obsession: mastering the devastatingly powerful yet impractical explosion magic. Inspired by a mysterious savior from her past, she dedicates her life to perfecting this one spell, even if it leaves her depleted of mana and unable to move for the rest of the day. Enrolling in the prestigious Red Prison academy with her self-proclaimed rival and childhood friend Yunyun, Megumin delves deeper into the secrets and history of her clan, all while honing her explosive craft. But as her little sister Komekko discovers a seemingly ordinary black kitten in the woods, the fate of a sealed Dark God becomes intertwined with Megumin's explosive journey. Witness the adventures of Megumin as she strives to become the greatest explosion wizard of all time, one year before the arrival of a certain useless goddess and NEET extraordinaire.",
