  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Neo-Zeon remnants and the Earth Federation are locked in a relentless pursuit of the elusive Phenex, a unique Gundam model from the Unicorn series, in U.C. 0097. The appearance of this enigmatic mobile suit coincides with the resurfacing of its vanished pilot, a Newtype girl named Rita Bernal. The Laplace Incident, which transpired a year prior, has left the world largely unchanged, despite the Universal Century Charter's acknowledgement of Newtypes and their rights.\n\nAs the race to locate Phenex intensifies, Luio & Co. dispatches Michele Luio, a special advisor, and Jona Basta, a Newtype, to aid the Earth Federation. Both Michele and Jona share a childhood connection with Rita, and the trio is rumored to have thwarted a calamity together 18 years ago. During their quest, they cross paths with Zoltan Akkanen, a volatile Zeon soldier who poses a significant threat to all parties involved.\n\nIn the midst of this conflict, the formidable power of two Full Psycho Frame mobile suits, the White Unicorn and the Black Lion, remains a haunting memory from the final battle of the Laplace Incident. The RX-0 Unicorn Gundam 03, now referred to as Phenex, the immortal golden bird, has emerged once more, reigniting tensions and sparking a new chapter in the ongoing struggle.",
