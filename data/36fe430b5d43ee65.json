    "text": "Aterui--a formidable leader of the indigenous Ainu people--faces off against the Imperial Court in a historical conflict, as observed by an unexpected time-traveling spectator: a present-day elementary school student. This pseudo-historical anime movie transports our young protagonist back in time, immersing him in the Ainu's struggle against the Imperial Yamato Court, and providing a unique perspective on a pivotal moment in Japanese history.",
