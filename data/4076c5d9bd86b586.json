    "text": "No longer a mundane salaryman, a 30-year-old gaming aficionado awakens in a fantasy realm, reincarnated as a sentient sword! Craving a worthy partner, he encounters Fran, a young cat girl from the infamous Black Cat Tribe, who is escaping the clutches of slave traders. With the sword's guidance, Fran vanquishes her pursuers and claims him as her own, naming him 'Shishou.' Together, they embark on a thrilling adventure to defy the odds and liberate Fran's enslaved kin. As they journey onward, Shishou vows to remain by Fran's side until she achieves her dream of becoming the first Black Cat Tribe member to evolve into a mightier beast, forging an unbreakable bond between sword and wielder.",
