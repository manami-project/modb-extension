  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dawn ing in the era of CE 70, the conflict between Earth Alliance's Naturals and the genetically-enhanced Coordinators of PLANT has reached unprecedented heights, following the tragic event of 'Bloody Valentine'. The ZAFT, PLANT's military, holds a significant advantage with their mobile suits, leaving Earth Alliance's mobile armors in the dust. Amidst this chaos, Kira Yamato, a Coordinator residing in the neutral colony of Heliopolis, inadvertently discovers Earth Alliance's secret project - the powerful mobile suits he dubs Gundam. As ZAFT launches a surprise attack, Kira is thrust into a battle against his own kind to safeguard his Natural companions aboard the Earth Alliance battleship Archangel. Faced with the dilemma to continue fighting or abandon the Archangel against the stolen Gundams, Kira's decisions could alter the course of the war.\n\nThis gripping tale is encapsulated in three TV specials, recompiled from the Mobile Suit Gundam SEED series: The Empty Battlefield, The Far-Away Dawn, and The Rumbling Sky. These specials, originally aired in Japan, serve as an enhanced recap of the 50-episode TV series, featuring new scenes, re-animations, and re-dubs, offering a fresh perspective on the unfolding drama.",
