  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the Cosmic Era 70, tensions escalate between genetically-enhanced Coordinators and regular Naturals. The powerful military group ZAFT launches a surprise attack on the neutral space colony Heliopolis. During this attack, teenager Kira Yamato stumbles upon a secret Earth Alliance project developing mobile suits called Gundams. Though a Coordinator himself, Kira feels compelled to pilot one of these Gundams to protect his Natural friends aboard the EA battleship Archangel. To recap the TV series, three compilation films were released: The Empty Battlefield, The Far-Away Dawn, and The Rumbling Sky. While largely presenting the same narrative, these special edition movies tweak some scenes and include additional new footage not seen in the original series. Ultimately, they serve to retell the full 50-episode storyline in movie format for fans. With ZAFT having stolen four other Gundams, Kira faces an excruciating choice: continue fighting against his own people, or leave the Archangel vulnerable to devastating attack. The course he chooses could determine the outcome of the escalating conflict.",
