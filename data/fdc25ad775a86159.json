  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Morisato Keiichi, a college student, finds his life turned upside down when not one, but three goddesses - Belldandy, Skuld, and Urd - move in with him. This divine arrangement began a year ago when Keiichi called the Goddess Helpline and wished for a goddess to be his forever, leading to Belldandy's arrival. As they navigate their unique living situation, a new threat emerges that could sever the bond between Keiichi and Belldandy.\n\nThe Lord of Terror's previous encounter caused damage to Yggdrasil's systems, resulting in the loss of the contract that binds Belldandy and Keiichi. With Christmas approaching, the couple hopes that the information can be retrieved before Belldandy is ordered back to Heaven. Skuld and Urd attempt to assist, but their efforts may cause more harm than good.\n\nAdding to the chaos, Peorth, the queen of hell, arrives to grant another of Keiichi's wishes, believing that Belldandy isn't fulfilling her role. As these goddesses vie for control and influence, Keiichi's life becomes increasingly complicated. The delicate balance between mortals and immortals teeters on the brink of chaos, and Keiichi must navigate these divine challenges while trying to preserve his happiness with Belldandy.",
