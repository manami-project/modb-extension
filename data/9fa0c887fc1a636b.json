    "text": "Gundams, once the guardians of peace, are now obsolete as Earth and its space colonies bask in unity and prosperity under the Earth Sphere Unified Nation in A.C. 196. Four of the five legendary pilots decide to discard their mobile suits into the sun, but their plans are abruptly halted by the sudden rebellion led by Mariemaia Khushrenada, the alleged daughter of the late dictator Treize. With the goal of global domination, Mariemaia kidnaps Relena Darlian, the vice foreign minister, with the help of her grandfather Dekim Barton, threatening the fragile peace. Heero Yuy, Trowa Barton, Duo Maxwell, and Quatre Raberba Winner must now reclaim their Gundams and stand as the last defense against Mariemaia's ambitions. But the battle will be arduous as their former comrade Wufei Chang has joined forces with the enemy. Will the pilots succeed in preserving the hard-earned peace and completing their final mission?",
