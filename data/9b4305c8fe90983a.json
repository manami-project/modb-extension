    "text": "Koyomi Araragi makes a fateful decision to help the vampire Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade revive her full powers after finding her gravely injured. To accomplish this, he hunts down the three vampire hunters who had defeated Kiss-shot previously and retrieves her severed limbs. However, after succeeding in his quest, Koyomi begins to question if fully restoring this dangerous immortal vampire was the right thing to do. Kiss-shot reveals to Koyomi the harsh reality of living as a vampire, creatures forced to prey on humans for survival. Overcome by regret for his actions, Koyomi struggles to come to terms with his undead existence. His friend Tsubasa Hanekawa approaches him, seemingly with a plan to resolve this increasingly dire situation. But the true motivations and capabilities of those involved remain shrouded in mystery. With his fate intertwined with formidable immortal beings, Koyomi finds himself facing threats beyond his comprehension. Difficult decisions lie ahead that may challenge his sense of right and wrong. How this volatile situation will ultimately play out, no one can yet say for certain.",
