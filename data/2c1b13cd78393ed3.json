  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two OVA episodes were released alongside volumes 8 and 10 of the light novels on which this anime is based. These OVAs take place chronologically between the first and second seasons of the main series. In the first OVA, the energetic vampire ninja Haruna organizes a carnival event where the stoic Eucliwood is offered as a prize. Later, the capable fighter Seraphim tries her hand at cooking a meal in Ayumu's home where she resides. Ayumu ends up being repeatedly probed in a very uncomfortable area much to his dismay. The second OVA sees Haruna eager to spend more time with Eucliwood at a swimming pool for some aquatic fun. With Eucliwood's birthday approaching, Haruna prepares an enthusiastic birthday party in her signature flashy style. Ayumu and the others also prepare birthday gifts for the quiet girl as they come together to celebrate their cherished friend.",
