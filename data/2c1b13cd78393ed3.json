  "synopsis": {
    "text": "OVAs accompanying the 8th and 10th volumes of the original novel serve as a bridge between the first and second seasons of this anime. In one episode, Haruna takes charge of a carnival, offering Eu as the grand prize. In another, Sera attempts to showcase her culinary skills, while Ayumu finds himself in an awkward predicament.\n\nSeason 1, Episode 13 witnesses Haruna organizing a unique Spring Festival at the local shrine, infused with her distinctive magical-Equipment-girl charm. Meanwhile, Seraphim, determined not to burden Haruna and Ayumu, decides to contribute by cooking. Additionally, a concentration game in the school's assembly hall tests Ayumu and Orito's endurance.\n\nIn Season 2, Episode 0, Haruna yearns for more pool time with Hellscythe. The second part of the episode revolves around Hellscythe's upcoming birthday, with Haruna planning a magical-Equipment-girl-themed party. The curiosity builds as we wonder about the nature of the party and the gifts Ayumu and his friends have in store for Hellscythe.",
