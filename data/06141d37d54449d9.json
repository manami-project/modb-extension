    "text": "Set in a near-future Paris, Mireille Bouquet, a skilled assassin, receives an enigmatic email from a young Japanese girl named Kirika Yuumura. The email contains a cryptic message, \"Join me on a journey to the past,\" and a melody that resonates with Mireille's tragic childhood memories. As she meets Kirika, the two are ambushed, revealing Kirika's exceptional combat skills and her inexplicable lack of remorse for her victims. With no recollection of her past and an uncanny proficiency in killing, Kirika's only clue to her identity is the codename \"Noir,\" a name that carries a dark history and a thousand-year-old legacy.\n\nAs they navigate the treacherous world of assassins, Mireille and Kirika form an uneasy alliance, seeking answers to their intertwined pasts and the mysterious organization known as Les Soldats that seems to control their lives. As they take on high-stakes assignments, the duo's journey unravels a complex web of secrets, lies, and hidden truths that could either set them free or destroy them. With their shared history and an uncertain future, the two assassins must confront their past and uncover the truth behind the name \"Noir.\"",
