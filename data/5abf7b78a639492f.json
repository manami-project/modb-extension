    "text": "In the heart of New York City, four high school students, Kate, Rose, Clare, and Rachel, lead separate lives within the same elite school, each immersed in their own world. Their paths cross when they are inexplicably drawn together by a series of mysterious events, including the tragic death of a classmate and their own inexplicable memory loss.\n\nOne morning, they awaken feeling disoriented and unable to recall the previous night. Soon, they learn about a classmate's suicide, and instead of returning home after school is canceled, they find themselves guided to a park by enigmatic butterflies that only they can perceive. Here, they encounter a strange couple who reveal a shocking truth - the girls are no longer among the living.\n\nAs the city grapples with a bizarre wave of suicides, these four girls from diverse backgrounds must unite to unravel the secrets of their shared fate. They must navigate through a hidden realm of conflict on the city streets, all while dealing with their own personal struggles. Their survival hinges on their newfound alliance, as they strive to unlock the mystery of their death and seek a path back to their previous lives.",
