    "text": "These synopses introduce us to a dystopian Japan, divided by a historical war between KANTO and KANSAI, leaving the latter under the former's rule. The once-thriving KANSAI has devolved into a crime-ridden territory, with its political and law enforcement powers dwindling. The criminals, known as 'AKUDAMA', strive to live authentic lives in this highly-developed yet twisted society.\n\nAmongst the neon-lit streets and cybernetic screens of KANSAI, a dangerous underworld thrives. The infamous AKUDAMA 'Cutthroat', accused of 999 murders, is set for public execution. However, an enigmatic message summons several elite AKUDAMA to liberate Cutthroat in exchange for a hefty reward. This clandestine orchestration sets the stage for a chaotic and deadly showdown.\n\nIn this fractured world, a young girl named Ippanjin is wrongfully detained for failing to pay for a meal with cash. As the news broadcasts the impending execution of a criminal, four other criminals receive messages to rescue him. With no intention of cooperating, these criminals view the mission as a chance to showcase their skills on live television. As the execution descends into chaos, Ippanjin finds herself entangled with these four criminals, setting the stage for a thrilling and unpredictable adventure.",
