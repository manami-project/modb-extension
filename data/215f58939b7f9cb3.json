  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seizo Watase, the creator of Chalk-Colored People, presents a heartwarming collection of romantic vignettes in this anime adaptation of his 1983 manga series from Comic Morning. Each short tale unfolds in the brief span of time it takes to smoke a cigarette, capturing the essence of love in everyday moments. From the awkward first meeting in an elevator to the warmth of receiving a hand-knit sweater, love blossoms in the most ordinary situations. With narratives often featuring unnamed characters, referred to simply as 'Me' and 'Her', these stories include Emblem of My Father, Two in the Beer Garden, Old Hawaii Corner, My Brother's Zippo, and Takeru's Love of Two and a Half Millennia. The tobacco analogy may seem unusual in today's politically correct climate, but it serves as a reminder of the brevity and simplicity of these poignant love stories.",
