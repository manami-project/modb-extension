  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, a boy, living in solitude, encounters a winged insect and destroys it, driven by repulsion. An elephant silently witnesses this event but remains quiet. Suddenly, malice emerges, as unpredictable and fleeting as a blinking eye or an erratic insect's flight. From this moment, the boy finds himself relentlessly pursued by ominous shadows resembling the winged insects he once crushed. This captivating anime, a graduate work from Tokyo University of the Arts in 2021, explores themes of guilt and consequences through its unique narrative and visual style.",
