  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This surreal anime follows a young boy who has a fateful encounter with an insect. One day, he comes across a winged bug and, in a moment of disgust, crushes it. Unbeknownst to the boy, a silent observer - an elephant - witnesses his malicious actions. From that day forward, the boy finds himself haunted by shadows and visions of the insect he killed. The anime uses striking imagery and an unconventional narrative to explore themes of morality, guilt, and the unforeseen consequences of one's actions. The insect serves as a symbol of the fragility of life while the elephant represents the watchful eyes of karma. Each time the boy lashes out, more shadows emerge to haunt him. Evocative and metaphorical, this anime offers a poetic meditation on human cruelty towards lesser creatures and how the ripples of small acts of violence can follow someone throughout life. Surreal visuals that may seem inscrutable at first glance reinforce the cyclical nature of the story. In the end, the work leaves it up to viewers to derive their own meaning from the boy's haunting journey.",
