  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Complex ed by their respective heights, Risa Koizumi and Atsushi Ootani find themselves the unwitting stars of their high school's comedy hour. Risa, towering above her female peers, and Ootani, dwarfed by his male counterparts, share a common plight that fuels their constant squabbles. Yet, beneath the veneer of their comedic rivalry, a tender friendship blossoms, and Risa finds herself developing feelings for Ootani.\n\nLike any typical high school girl, Risa yearns for a romantic tale to swoon over. Initially smitten by the tall and handsome Ryouji Suzuki, she is left heartbroken when he falls for another. Meanwhile, Ootani, despite his short stature, nurses his own unrequited love. Thrown together by their shared heartaches, Risa and Ootani form an unlikely alliance, vowing to help each other find love.\n\nHowever, as they spend more time together, they begin to see each other in a new light. Could their height differences, once a source of embarrassment, become the bridge that connects them? Will they overcome societal norms and embrace their unique pairing, or will their Lovelyâ˜…Complex prove to be an insurmountable hurdle?\n\nBased on Aya Nakahara's popular manga, Lovely Complex is a heartwarming tale of love, friendship, and self-acceptance, seasoned with a healthy dose of humor and Osaka charm.",
