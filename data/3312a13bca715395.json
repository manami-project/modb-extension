  "synopsis": {
    "text": "What lies beyond the towering, enigmatic wall that borders the desolate beach remains a mystery. In the shadow of this colossal structure, a solitary hut houses a young girl, recognizable by her distinctive pigtails. Living in isolation, her only human contact comes in the form of masked scientists who visit weekly to provide her with essential supplies and conduct inexplicable examinations. Sometimes, a boy pays her a visit, adding a touch of variety to her otherwise monotonous existence.\n\nThe world as we knew it has been shattered by cataclysmic events, leaving the girl to carry on with her mundane tasks, such as hanging laundry, amidst the remnants of a once bustling civilization. Unbeknownst to her, the inanimate objects that populate her home have taken on lives of their own. They engage in lively debates and share stories about their surroundings and the girl herself, all while she remains blissfully unaware of their sentience.\n\nOne day, the rhythm of her solitary life is disrupted by an unexpected encounter. A stranger presents her with a choice that holds the potential to alter the course of her life and the fate of others. As she stands at the precipice of change, the girl must decide whether to embrace the unknown or maintain the familiarity of her isolated existence.",
