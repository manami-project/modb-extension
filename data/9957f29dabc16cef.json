  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows the Qin state's efforts to conquer and unify the warring states of ancient China. Fresh off their successful Sanyou campaign, the Qin army sets its sights east towards Wei and the other states. However, Qin's temporary truce with Zhao proves disastrous, as Zhao's cunning new Prime Minister Li Mu secretly forms an alliance of six states that launch a surprise attack on Qin. Facing an invasion from Chu, Zhao, Wei, Han, Yan, and Qi, Qin is in grave peril. Under the command of the young king Ying Zheng and 1000-Man Commander Xin, Qin races to devise a strategy to withstand the coalition army. The kingdom's very survival hangs in the balance as Qin prepares to make a desperate last stand at the reputedly impregnable Kankoku Pass. This story of war and conquest centers on the exploits of Xin, Zheng, and other key figures fighting to realize Qin's dream of unifying China under one rule. Though Qin now faces its gravest threat yet, Xin and Zheng remain committed to their vision of Chinese unification, resolved to lead Qin to victory against impossible odds.",
