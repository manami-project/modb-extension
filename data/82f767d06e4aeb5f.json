    "text": "English Dub Premiere at New York Comic Con! In the chilly winter, a heated battle unfolds within the UA dormitory, right before the Endeavor Internship arc of season 5. The first-year students of Class 1-A, confined indoors and longing for excitement, are paid a visit by none other than third-year student Mirio Togata. In his hands, he carries an enthralling card game called 'Yuuei Heroes Battle,' crafted by the support course. This game, mirroring the challenges of U.A. itself, sees students strategically choosing cards featuring various U.A. heroes. As the game intensifies, it becomes clear that there's more to it than initially thought. Who will rise as the ultimate victor in this unexpected card battle? (Source: Anime News Network)",
