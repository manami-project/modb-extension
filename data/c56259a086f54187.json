  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a post-apocalyptic world devastated by war, two young girls named Chito and Yuuri wander the ruins in search of food, fuel, and supplies. They travel on their treasured vehicle called a Kettenkrad, scavenging old military sites and exploring abandoned buildings. Despite the isolation and hopelessness around them, the two find joy in the simple experiences they share - whether it's target practice with their guns, reading ancient books, or having snowball fights amidst the wreckage. While other survivors are scarce, Chito and Yuuri occasionally encounter them in their travels. There's the scientist Ishii still determined to build flying machines, or the mapper Kanazawa tirelessly documenting the lifeless landscape. But most times, the girls are on their own, facing numerous challenges yet refusing to despair. Through their contrasting personalities and unwavering camaraderie, the series follows Chito and Yuuri's quest to find meaning in their bleak world. As they search for fuel and sustenance, they also uncover slivers of beauty and hope in this dystopian future. Together, the two girls continue to live and share uplifting experiences, finding happiness in each other even when humanity and civilization has long faded away.",
