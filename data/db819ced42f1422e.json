  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Haneru is an energetic middle school student with a deep passion for dancing. Inspired by his idol Jey El, the world's hottest dancer, Haneru practices every day after school at Memorial Hall, unaware that his \"secret\" sessions are being watched by Kanon Otosaki. Kanon, whose online persona is the famous dancer Rhythm, goes to the same spot to practice. When Haneru discovers that Kanon is Rhythm, he immediately asks her to dance together. Though shy at first, Kanon realizes the joy of performing with others. The two form a dance group called \"Tribe Cool Crew\" along with friends Kumonosuke, Mizuki, and Yuzuru. Together, they enter the dynamic world of street dancing and face off against intense competition, driven by their dream of one day dancing on stage with Jey El. As these middle schoolers grow in their passion for dance, they learn lessons about friendship, teamwork, and finding happiness in the things you love to do. Their coming-of-age story depicts both the challenges of competitive dancing as well as the utter joy of moving together in rhythm.",
