The creative minds of XFLAG and the all-female rock band SCANDAL have come together to create an original animated short: XPICE—a tale of heroes who grow as they protect their city. The story is seasoned with courage, sprinkled with teamwork, and filled with heartwarming moments. The short is directed by Tsubasa Nakai and set to the song Spice by SCANDAL. In the bustling city of Kokyo, where diverse people coexist, the enigmatic group Zerogram poses a threat. But fear not, for Red Pepper and Wasabi—a dynamic duo from the superhero league XPICE—are ready to defend their city. Red Pepper's powerful punches keep the villains at bay, while Wasabi's gentle touch heals the injured. Despite their success, Wasabi yearns for a deeper sense of purpose as a hero. When the emergency alert signals Red Pepper's distress, Wasabi musters the courage to face the challenge and seizes the opportunity to discover their true potential.",
