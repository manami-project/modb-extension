But when he and his friend Shiba stumble upon a grisly murder scene in an elevator after a night of drinking, Kyohei's old life comes crashing back. As it turns out, the murder is linked to Kyohei's unique ability as a \"seki,\" a person capable of psychically controlling ancient wooden dolls known as \"kakashi,\" which are believed to be divine vessels. Now, a rogue kakashi is on the loose in Tokyo, and it's up to Kyohei to stop it and confront the friend from his past who may be responsible.
