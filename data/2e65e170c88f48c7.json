  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Exploration, curiosity, and the allure of the unknown drive young Elaina, a witch inspired by her favorite book and its tales of the world-traversing witch, Nike. Becoming the youngest witch apprentice at 14, Elaina trains under the guidance of Fran, eventually earning the title of \"Ashen Witch.\" With her newfound status, Elaina sets out on her own journey, eager to experience the world's wonders and peculiarities.\n\nThroughout her travels, Elaina encounters a diverse array of people and their stories: a country that only welcomes magicians, a giant enamored with muscles, a youth desperate to save his lover from death's clutches, and a lonely princess in a desolate kingdom. Along the way, she crosses paths with Saya, an aspiring witch struggling to pass her exam, who becomes a recurring presence in Elaina's life.\n\nAs Elaina's journey unfolds, she discovers the enchanting and sometimes shadowy aspects of the world and witchcraft. Embracing the highs and lows of her adventures, Elaina weaves her own tale of encounters, farewells, and the magic that binds them all.",
