    "text": "Tsuneo is a hardworking university student with a passion for diving and marine biology. He works multiple jobs to fund his dream of studying abroad. One fateful night, he has a chance encounter with Josee, a young woman confined to a wheelchair who lives life through her imagination, painting, and books. Josee is named after a character from her favorite novel, Wonderful Clouds. Due to her disability, she rarely leaves her grandmother's house. By chance, Tsuneo meets Josee and her grandmother during their morning walk. Recognizing Josee's limited engagement with the outside world, the grandmother hires Tsuneo to be Josee's caretaker. Initially abrasive, Josee comes to realize Tsuneo may be her ticket to facing the real world. And Tsuneo sees accompanying Josee as an opportunity to save more money for his goals. Over time, Tsuneo introduces Josee to life's wonders, while Josee shows Tsuneo her unique dreams and perspective. Through their journey together, Josee and Tsuneo inspire courage and love within each other. Their story is one of two dreamers overcoming lifeâ€™s tides through the power of mutual understanding.",
