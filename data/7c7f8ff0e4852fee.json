  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Exists in a world recovering from a catastrophic event known as the Second Impact, Neo Tokyo-3 is under siege by enigmatic creatures called Angels. In an attempt to defend the city, giant mechas called Evangelions are deployed, piloted by select teenagers. Shinji Ikari, a 14-year-old boy estranged from his father, is summoned to Neo Tokyo-3 to pilot Evangelion Unit-01. Despite his self-doubt, Shinji manages to synchronize with the mecha and is thrust into a battle against the Angels. As he fights, Shinji begins to uncover the truth behind the Angels, the Second Impact, and humanity's struggle against a higher power. This compilation recap movie, Evangelion: Death and Rebirth, serves as a precursor to the reworked ending of the series, The End of Evangelion. With multiple versions of the movie available, including Death(True) and Death(True)^2, this film is a must-watch for fans of the original series.",
