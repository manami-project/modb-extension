    "text": "When the grim specter of death looms, most remain oblivious to its approach. However, Michiru Kita possesses an extraordinary ability: she can perceive the 'ring of death' around people's necks, a dark harbinger that deepens with the imminence of one's demise. Her mundane school life takes a supernatural turn when she notices two of her classmates, Chika Akatsuki and Shito Tachibana, bearing ominously black rings. Upon confronting them, she unearths their startling secret: they have already succumbed to death but have been granted a second chance through a mysterious loan office known as Zombie-Loan. The catch? They must repay their debt by hunting down malevolent zombies. As they learn of Michiru's 'Shinigami Eyes,' they enlist her help, plunging her into a world teeming with danger and darkness.",
