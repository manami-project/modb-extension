  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a parallel dimension that mirrors the ancient city of Kyoto, a unique world thrives where humans and supernatural creatures coexist, blessed with eternal life. This utopia is safeguarded by a trio—Kurama, Yase, and Myoue—who eagerly anticipate the homecoming of their parents, Myoue Jonin and Koto. However, their tranquil existence is disrupted by the sudden arrival of a young girl, Koto, accompanied by her younger siblings, A and Un. Hailing from another dimension, Koto embarks on a quest to locate her missing mother, her journey leading her to this mysterious city. With her distinctive red eyes and a knack for mechanics, Koto's origins remain ambiguous, leaving others uncertain if she's human or a youkai. As she delves deeper into her search, Koto's presence stirs up long-dormant ripples, threatening to shatter the peace that has long reigned over this enigmatic city.",
