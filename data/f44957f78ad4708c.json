    "text": "With war now a spectacle orchestrated by corporations and fought by genetically modified teenagers, the world has found a twisted form of peace. Meet Yuuichi Kannami, a skilled fighter pilot stationed at a European base, who, like his peers, is a 'Kildren' - forever young until death claims them in the sky. As he navigates the enigmatic world of Area 262, he uncovers unsettling truths about his predecessor, the legendary pilot 'Teacher,' and the base commander, Suito Kusanagi, who shares his own mysterious past. As Kannami grapples with the reality of his existence and the true nature of his battles, he must confront the unsettling connection between his commander and the seemingly endless cycle of warfare. Based on Hiroshi Mori's novel series, 'The Sky Crawlers' invites you to embark on a thought-provoking journey filled with action, suspense, and the haunting beauty of eternal adolescence.",
