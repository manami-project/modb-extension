  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 21st century Japan, aliens have been living on Earth alongside humans for over 20 years since their mothership landed. While most aliens have integrated into human society, some face discrimination due to their low rank in the alien caste system. NieA is one such \"Under Seven\" alien who takes up residence in the cramped closet of Mayuko, a cash-strapped human college student struggling with part-time jobs and little money for food. Though burdened by NieA's freeloading lifestyle and the mess of UFO parts cluttering her apartment, good-natured Mayuko allows the eccentric alien to stay. As the odd couple contends with curious friends, a declining bathhouse job, man-eating plants, and NieA's wasteful antics amidst a looming alien mothership, their day-to-day interspecies cohabitation unfolds through humorous clashes and unlikely camaraderie.",
