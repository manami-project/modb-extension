  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nanami is a young land god living in a shrine with her fox spirit familiar, Tomoe. As winter arrives, Nanami delights in the freshly fallen snow, while Tomoe watches over her fondly. Suddenly, Tomoe collapses as mysterious black marks appear on his body. Nanami rushes to help, but Tomoe rejects her assistance. With Tomoe's power fading, the shrine itself begins to collapse. Their old master, Mikage, appears and sends the ailing Tomoe into a magic mirror to relieve his suffering. Mikage reveals that centuries ago, Tomoe fell in love with a human woman named Yukiji. Seeking to live as a human with his beloved, Tomoe made a deal with a sinister god and ended up cursed, doomed to perish. He narrowly escaped death back then thanks to Yukiji's demise and Mikage's intervention. However, the curse has reawakened - Tomoe has fallen in love once more, this time with Nanami. As Mikage lacks the power to stop the curse, a resolute Nanami decides to travel back in time and prevent Tomoe's curse from occurring in the first place. But changing the past could erase their future together. As Nanami journeys into the past to rescue her cherished familiar, she discovers an even deeper bond with Tomoe than she realized.",
