  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's a land god, and he's her fox familiar. When Nanami Momozono witnesses Tomoe collapse amidst the winter snow, she's thrust into a race against time to save him. Dark markings mar his body, and their shrine crumbles without Tomoe's sustaining power. Enter Mikage, Tomoe's former master, who whisks Tomoe away into a magical mirror to ease his pain. The cause? A centuries-old curse, sparked by Tomoe's failed attempt to become human for his first love, Yukiji. With Yukiji's death and Mikage's intervention, Tomoe's memories and curse were erasedâ€”until now. The curse has resurfaced, triggered by Tomoe's newfound love for Nanami.\n\nDetermined to save Tomoe, Nanami embarks on a daring journey back in time, guided by Mizuki. Her mission: prevent Tomoe's curse from ever taking hold. But meddling with the past is a perilous game. If Nanami succeeds, it could mean she and Tomoe will never cross paths. Yet, Nanami remains steadfast, resolved to find a way to save the one she cares for. As she delves deeper into the past, Nanami uncovers unexpected connections, revealing a bond with Tomoe that transcends time.",
