In the serene countryside, Seigetsu Academy, once an all-boys institution, has recently transitioned to a co-ed school, with Tsukiko Yahisa claiming the title of the sole female student. The academy's unique astronomy curriculum and secluded location have kept other prospective female students at bay, leaving Tsukiko to navigate this new world with the help of her childhood friends, Kanata Nanami and Suzuya Touzuki. As Tsukiko adapts to her new surroundings, she crosses paths with the intriguing Zodiac boys, entwining her fate with theirs and setting the stage for a series of star-crossed encounters. Dive into the captivating universe of Starry Sky, available through Animate.tv and other platforms.",
