    "text": "The story unfolds as Minori Aizawa, a talented fashion designer, and her boss, Akihiko Hadano, find themselves stranded after a company party that extends late into the night. After missing the last train home, they reluctantly decide to share a capsule hotel room. As the night progresses, the two coworkers, known for their constant bickering, find themselves in an unexpected situation that ignites a spark between them. In the confined space of the capsule hotel, Minori and Akihiko discover an undeniable attraction that neither of them can ignore. As they navigate their professional lives, they struggle to resist the temptation of their newfound connection. This anime explores the complexities of love and desire in the workplace, with two versions available: a TV-friendly \"innocent\" version and a more explicit \"obscene\" version for online audiences.",
