    "text": "In the aftermath of the previous battle with Alphamon, the DigiDestined welcome new members Meiko and Meicoomon into their group with a relaxing trip to a hot spring. However, tensions rise as Joe struggles to balance his academics with his duties as a DigiDestined, becoming distant from the group. Just as repairs from the previous damage are nearing completion, a new infected Digimon - Ogremon - suddenly emerges. Though the DigiDestined mean well, their decisions in dealing with this new threat lead to unintended consequences. Meanwhile, Mimi has recently returned from living overseas and struggles to reconnect with her friends and fellow DigiDestined. And Joe throws himself into his studies to avoid issues involving Digimon, causing his partner Gomamon to run away. Their personal conflicts put a strain on the group's unity when infected Digimon continue posing a threat. The DigiDestined must come together, overcoming internal disputes, if they hope to rise against encroaching darkness.",
