    "text": "She was just an ordinary office worker, but one fateful day, Kaoru Nagase's life took an extraordinary turn. A celestial being responsible for overseeing Earth made a grave mistake, causing Kaoru to lose her physical body. As recompense, the being offered her reincarnation in a new, less advanced world, with a few special abilities. Kaoru, never one to shy away from a challenge, seized the opportunity and asked for the power to create potions with any desired effect, a magical Item Box, the ability to understand and speak every language, and her 15-year-old body. Now, in this unfamiliar world, Kaoru must navigate through the complexities of her new life, armed with her wits and her extraordinary abilities. Will she succeed in carving out a stable existence, or will the challenges of this new world prove too much for her to handle? Only time will tell.",
