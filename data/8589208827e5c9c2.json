  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Colorful! follows the escapades of various men as they go to ridiculous lengths to catch glimpses of women's underwear and cleavage. From hiding under tables to stalking their English teacher, these men face humorous consequences in their endless quest for eyefuls. Spanning a range of everyday locations like subways, parks, and malls, the vignettes showcase men ogling hotties, brazenly snapping panty shots, and decorating their rooms with their photographic trophies. Women are objectified through leering stares and illicit photos, reducing them to body parts for male titillation. With its wacky animation and outlandish characters, Colorful! presents the world through the eyes of the stereotypical straight male gaze. The show revels in absurd perversion for comedic effect, while normalizing the objectification of women.",
