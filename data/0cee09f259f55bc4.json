  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Itoshiki Nozomu, the epitome of negativity, finds himself once again in the unenviable position of educating a motley crew of eccentric high school students, including Fuura Kafuka, the world's most optimistic individual. As exam season looms, Nozomu's misfortune reaches new heights when he is arrested for being a harbinger of bad luck.\n\nIn this third installment of the beloved series, Nozomu persists in his mission to expose his students to the harsh realities of life, tackling topics such as the irrational influence of superstitions, society's reluctance to acknowledge multiple talents in individuals, and the hidden triggers that shape people's behavior. Despite his best efforts, Nozomu often finds himself swept up in the chaotic whirlwind of his students' antics. This time, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery to Hokkaido, encounters a doppelganger, and gets lost in a city teeming with dubious choices.\n\nAs the peculiar teacher of the equally bizarre Class 2-H, Nozomu continues his uphill battle to instill a dose of reality in his students. However, his efforts often backfire, resulting in a life that is more challenging and chaotic than ever before. Despite the odds, Nozomu perseveres, making for a wild and entertaining ride in this unique anime series.",
