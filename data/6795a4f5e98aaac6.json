  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Minami and Tatsuya find themselves under new leadership as Eijiro Kashiwaba assumes the role of coach for Meisei High School's baseball team due to an illness. Kashiwaba's unforgiving nature propels the team into a grueling Spartan training regimen, leaving the duo questioning his true motives and uncovering hidden tales from his past. This compilation movie, set in the third year of the Touch timeline, introduces significant plot variations, supplementary scenes, and the omission of a pivotal character, which may not entirely align with the events of the fourth movie.",
