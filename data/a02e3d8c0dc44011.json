The temple he chooses turns out to be a nunnery, filled with charming girls of all sorts, including the very girl who had stolen his heart. To make matters worse, he learns that his father had borrowed a significant amount of money from the nunnery and had fled without repaying it. Now, Akemitsu must work at the nunnery to repay the debt, all while trying to maintain his celibacy amidst a sea of beautiful women. Will he be able to resist temptation and uphold his vow, or will he succumb to the very desires he sought to escape?
