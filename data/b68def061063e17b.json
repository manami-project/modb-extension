  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Maris is the last surviving refugee from the now extinct planet Thanatos. Blessed with superhuman strength six times that of an average human, she struggles to control her power in a galaxy filled with fragile beings and objects. Despite wearing special alloy restraints, she accidentally destroys nearly everything she touches, racking up endless debt from the ensuing repairs. Hoping to earn enough money to get out of debt, Maris joins the Inter-Galactic Space Patrol. However, the rescue missions she is assigned continue to drain her wages each time collateral damage is deducted from her pay. When Maris is chosen to save the rich and handsome Prince Kogane Maru from his kidnapper, she sees it as the perfect opportunity to win his affection and solve her monetary woes through marriage. But best laid plans often go awry, and Maris soon realizes that real life is much more complicated than her fantasy. With her uncanny strength, mountain of debt, and ill-conceived romantic notions, Maris is in for an adventurous ride as she carries out her Space Patrol duties across the galaxy. Though the odds seem stacked against her, one can't help but root for this accidental disaster magnet determined to do some good in the universe.",
