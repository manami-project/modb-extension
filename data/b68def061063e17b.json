  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The powerful Thanatosian, Maris, finds herself in a perpetual cycle of debt and destruction as she navigates life among Earthlings. Hailing from a now-extinct planet, her extraordinary strength—six times that of an average human—often leads to unintentional chaos and mounting repair bills. Despite her parents' less-than-ideal influence—an alcoholic father and a scatterbrained mother—Maris strives to make ends meet, even donning a restrictive suit to minimize her destructive potential.\n\nWorking for the Inter-Galactic Space Patrol, Maris hopes that each mission will be her ticket out of financial turmoil. However, her hopes are repeatedly dashed when her wages are docked to cover the damages caused by her unintentional havoc. But when she's assigned to rescue the wealthy and handsome Kogane Maru from his merciless kidnapper, Maris envisions a life-changing opportunity. She dreams of not only saving him but also winning his heart, believing that his gratitude will lead to marriage and the end of her monetary woes. Will this mission finally be the answer to her problems, or will reality prove to be far more complicated?",
