  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Renya Kunugi lived a long and fulfilling life, passing away peacefully at age 94. However, death was not the end for Renya. He awoke to find himself face-to-face with a young girl claiming to be God. As it turned out, she desperately needed someone to help with interdimensional resource smuggling. In exchange, she offered Renya an 18-year-old body and powerful abilities. Though hesitant at first, the promise of exotic food sealed the deal. Transported to an alternate world, Renya embarked on a new adventure. Despite starting off as an average person, he quickly rose to the occasion - fighting off bandits, vanquishing monsters, and leaving his mark through sheer talent and determination. With blossoming abilities granting him great power, Renya set out to explore this unfamiliar land. Full of action and intrigue, Renya's tale proved engaging. However, discriminatory remarks from the original light novel author torpedoed anime adaptation plans. Scheduled for release in 2018, the production faced swift cancellation. Nonetheless, the protagonist's fantastical fresh start and awe-inspiring journey in a new world endured as a story worth telling.",
