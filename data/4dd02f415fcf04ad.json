  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Renya Kunugi, a contented 94-year-old man, willingly embraced death, eager to close his eyes for the final time. However, his peaceful farewell was disrupted when he awoke in an unfamiliar, empty space, confronted by a young girl in a tunic claiming to be God. Skeptical and agitated, Renya responded with a swift kick, only to discover that the girl was indeed divine and in dire need of assistance. God's mission for Renya? Interdimensional resource smuggling. His task was to traverse into another world and reside there for a few decades. To entice him, God offered him a youthful body and an array of formidable skills. Yet, Renya's interest was truly piqued when God mentioned the food - an exotic world brimming with exotic delicacies. In the blink of an eye, Renya found himself in a foreign land, rejuvenated, strengthened, but utterly bewildered. As he navigates this new world, the question lingers: Will Renya survive this world, or will the world survive him? This anime, however, was cancelled due to controversial remarks by the author of the source material.",
