    "text": "The thrilling and comedic tale of Ranma and Rella unfolds in the crime-infested city of Kirin, where they operate their detective agency. The two are poles apart: Ranma, a penniless detective with a strong moral compass, and Rella, a wealthy adrenaline junkie. A mysterious accident forces them to share a single body, with each taking control at the stroke of midnight. As they navigate through their cases, they must also unravel the enigma of their shared existence and find a way back to their individual bodies. Adding to the mystery is the sudden appearance of a woman named Alice, whose intentions remain unclear. With time constantly running out, the two-in-one detective duo must solve cases, confront dangerous criminals, and ultimately, find a solution to their own bizarre predicament.",
