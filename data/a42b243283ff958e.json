  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shin-Ou and Tai-Kou, two provinces of the kingdom of Ryoza, have long coexisted in harmony, safeguarded by the formidable Touda, a species of war-lizards commanded by the indomitable Grand Duke Taikou. In the heart of Tai-Kou's Ake village, a young girl named Erin, inspired by her mother Soyon, the village's chief Touda doctor, aspires to follow in her footsteps. However, when calamity strikes and Soyon is unjustly blamed for the death of the Grand Duke's strongest Touda, their tranquil existence crumbles. In her quest to save her mother, Erin is swept away by a river, finding herself stranded in the unfamiliar territory of Shin-Ou. As tensions between the provinces escalate, Erin must adapt to her new life and unravel the truth about the beasts and humanity. Based on Uehashi Nahoko's fantasy series, this anime delves into the complexities of prejudice, war, and the bond between humans and animals.",
