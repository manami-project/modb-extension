    "text": "Tsuchida, a fresh and nervous male teacher at the bustling Hanamaru Kindergarten, finds himself in a whirlwind of unexpected challenges and romantic entanglements. Anzu, a lively young student, is determined to win Tsuchida's heart, claiming she'll be his bride one day with the full support of her mother, Tsuchida's high school senior. Alongside her friends, the timid Koume and the eccentric Hiiragi, Anzu embarks on a mission to capture Tsuchida's affection. However, Tsuchida's heart lies elsewhere â€“ with the beautiful yet oblivious Yamamoto-sensei, who works in the neighboring class. As Tsuchida strives to excel in his teaching career, he must navigate through Anzu's relentless pursuit and his own unrequited love for Yamamoto, all while quelling the rumors swirling around the kindergarten.",
