  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Isshu, an anthology of one hundred romantic poems, forms the basis of the traditional Japanese card game, Karuta. In the anime Uta Koi, these poems come to life through a historical romance story set in ancient Japan. Selected by Fujiwara no Teika, the anthology features works from various poets, including Murasaki Shikibu from The Tale of Genji. The series takes a liberal interpretation of the poems, focusing on the romantic entanglements between Fujiwara and her love interest, Ariwara. Uta Koi offers viewers a unique glimpse into the origins of the poems, exploring the love stories that inspired them while providing a fresh perspective on the Hyakunin Isshu anthology.",
