  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Iketani is a street racer who once had a chance encounter with Mako, a female driver he used to date. They arrange to meet again after an awkward reunion, both hoping to rekindle their past romance. However, Iketani's good nature gets the better of him when he comes across an old man who has been separated from his tour group. Being unable to refuse helping the stranger, Iketani drives him across the island, jeopardizing his date with Mako. As Iketani races against time to get back for his meeting with Mako, it remains to be seen whether the two drivers so skilled at navigating tight mountain passes can steer their way back to each other's hearts after so much time apart. Their future hangs delicately in the balance, like a drift car kicking up smoke through a high-speed turn.",
