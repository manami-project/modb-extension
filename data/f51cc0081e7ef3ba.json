    "text": "Iketaniâ€™s regret for missing a chance to see Mako-chan and not apologizing haunts him, until a chance encounter with her six months later. The atmosphere is tense, and with no time to talk, they schedule another meeting. Eager and early, Iketani arrives at the meeting spot, only to be approached by a stranded elderly man from a tourist bus, who pleads for his help. Being the kind-hearted person he is, Iketani agrees, but will this detour cause him to miss Mako once again? Meanwhile, Mako grapples with her own aspirations of becoming a professional racer and the unexpected reunion with her ex-boyfriend, leaving her torn between her passion for racing and a second chance at love.",
