Inspired by her late sister's passion for hula dancing, she impulsively applies for a hula dancer position at the prestigious Spa Resort Hawaiians, known as the \"Hawaii of Tohoku.\" Despite her inexperience, Hiwa is accepted into the team, joining fellow dancers Kanna, Ranko, Ohana, and Shion.\n\nTheir diverse personalities initially clash, leading to a disastrous first performance that leaves the girls disheartened and labeled as the \"most pitiful rookies ever.\" However, instead of giving up, they choose to embrace their differences and strengthen their bond. Together, they learn to navigate the ups and downs of their newfound careers, forming unbreakable friendships along the way.\n\nWith renewed determination, Hiwa and her friends step back onto the stage, eager to share their love for hula dancing with the world and prove that they have what it takes to become true Hula Girls.",
