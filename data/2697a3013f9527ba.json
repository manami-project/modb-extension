  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Beneath the surface of the Earth lies the mystical world of Endra, where seven-colored bands drift across the skies and the giant Adamas shines brightly overhead. When 15-year-old Shun Asanaga, an optimistic and bright middle schooler, touches a mysterious crystal in his father's office, he is suddenly transported from the 'Land Above' into this unknown realm. Shun meets the recently imprisoned 16-year-old Prince Emilio, who harbors a strong hatred for the tyrannical King Deruzain. Seeking vengeance, Emilio had attempted to overthrow Deruzain after coming of age to inherit the throne, but was captured due to the overwhelming difference in strength. Heartbroken in his cell, Emilio is astonished when the walls distort and Shun appears before him. Now in Endra against his will, Shun's only chance to return home lies in helping Emilio defeat Deruzain. With one youth determined to return to his own world and the other desperate to reclaim his rightful place as king, they form an unlikely alliance. What fate awaits these two boys from vastly different upbringings as they join forces to take down an oppressive monarch? Their future now hangs in the balance between revenge and redemption under the gleaming Adamas sky.",
