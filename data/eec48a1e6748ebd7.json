  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two action-packed narratives unfold in this anime, each featuring characters and mecha from the Astray R and Astray B series. The first story follows Lowe Gear, a Junk Guild member who acquires a modified BuCUE suit head at an auction on Earth. This new addition to his Red Frame Astray serves as a dual beam saber, but also contains encrypted combat data that Lowe attempts to decode. However, his efforts are interrupted by a confrontation with several ZAFT suits, including a formidable CGUE DEEP Arms. In the second tale, Blue Frame pilot Gai Murakamo teams up with the Serpent Tail mercenaries to outsmart a GINN High Mobility Type. Just as they succeed, Gai is challenged by the legendary Edward Harrelson, who pilots the fearsome Sword Calamity Gundam and has just annihilated a ZAFT ship fleet. Both stories promise thrilling encounters and high-stakes battles in the Cosmic Era.",
