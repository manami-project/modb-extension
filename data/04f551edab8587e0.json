  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In this lighthearted special episode, Miya Tachibana worries about her older brother Junichi's future prospects since he is overly friendly with girls at school yet lacks a girlfriend. Concerned he may end up alone, Miya decides to secretly observe his interactions at school to understand why. She learns Junichi has many female friends who see him as nice and reliable. Perplexed that he remains single despite his popularity, Miya jumps to the conclusion that he must be attracted to men. However, after Miya herself turns down a boy's confession, she gains a new perspective on romance and starts questioning her assumptions about her brother. Though played for laughs, the episode explores assumptions about relationships and gives insight into the main characters.",
