  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A dutiful young fisherman works tirelessly each day to support his father rather than playing with other children. One day, he pulls an unusual pot from his fishing net. Upon opening it, a demon emerges, intent on devouring the boy. Thinking quickly, the clever fisherman challenges the demon to prove it can fit back inside the tiny pot. Offended, the demon stuffs itself into the pot, becoming trapped. The desperate demon promises riches if the fisherman releases it. But first, the wise youth shares a cautionary tale about a deceitful fox that betrays a lion despite relying on the beast for food. Taking heed, the properly chastised demon vows to mend its ways. As a reward for this valuable lesson, the grateful magical being presents the devoted son with a pot brimming with gold. This morality story was the first animated film commissioned for Japanese schools. The detailed visuals and inventive techniques come courtesy of animation pioneer Sanae Yamamoto’s studio. Though mainly adapted from Arabian Nights, a fable from Machiavelli’s The Prince is cleverly woven in as well. Blending whimsical adventure with universal wisdom, this groundbreaking anime short remains a winning combination.",
