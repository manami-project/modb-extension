Now known as an 'Ajin', one of only 46 in existence, Kei finds himself hunted by governments and researchers who want to capture him for brutal experiments. On the run, Kei struggles to understand his new identity and powers with the help of his 'Black Ghost', a supernatural entity that aids Ajin.

First emerging 17 years ago on African battlefields, Ajin have recently begun appearing among humans, throwing Kei's life into turmoil.
