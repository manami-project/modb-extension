First appearing 17 years ago on African battlefields, Ajin are feared and hunted by both governments and the public for their potential in scientific experiments. Now, Kei, once an ordinary high school student with dreams of becoming a doctor, finds himself on the run from humanity and fellow Ajin alike. With a bounty on his head, Kei's only chance at a peaceful life lies in mastering his newfound powers and evading the cruel experiments that await him. As he navigates this dangerous new world, Kei must rely on the strength of his 'Black Ghost' and confront his unwanted immortality.",
