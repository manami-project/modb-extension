    "text": "In a future where humanity's genetic makeup has taken a drastic turn, Kei and Ai find themselves in a relentless pursuit for survival. Ai, a seemingly innocent young girl, harbors a devastating secret that could bring about the end of their world. This world is now inhabited by Headmeters, individuals with psychic abilities, the intensity of which is displayed on their foreheads during combat. Kei, once an experimental subject, has always been limited to a power level of 5, while others easily surpass him. However, when Ai's safety is threatened, Kei's abilities mysteriously surge beyond any limit.\n\nTheir pursuers, led by a man with a hidden agenda, are aided by a diminutive, robot-suited ally. When Ai is finally seized, Kei teams up with a detective reminiscent of Sherlock Holmes and another Headmeter, who was turned to their side when Kei revealed his formidable powers through Ai. Their mission is clear: rescue Ai and safeguard the secret she carries. But what could this secret be? And who is Ai truly? The answers lie in their perilous journey ahead.",
