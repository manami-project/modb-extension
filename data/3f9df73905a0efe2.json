    "text": "To his surprise, Yakuza member Yoshifumi Nitta's life takes an unexpected turn when a mysterious capsule crash-lands on his head, revealing a young, blue-haired girl named Hina. With extraordinary supernatural powers, Hina coerces Nitta into taking her in, leaving him with little choice but to become her guardian. Despite the inconvenience, Nitta discovers that Hina's abilities can be an asset to his yakuza business. However, if she doesn't regularly use her powers, Hina could lose control and wreak havoc on everything around her, including Nitta.\n\nAs they navigate their new living arrangement, Nitta and Hina find themselves in various comedic and action-packed situations. From helping with construction deals to defending against rival yakuza groups, Hina's powers prove invaluable. But with the constant threat of her going berserk, Nitta must tread carefully to ensure his own safety.\n\nJoin Nitta and Hina as they embark on this unpredictable journey, filled with laughter, danger, and an unusual bond that forms between a hardened yakuza and a super-powered young girl.",
