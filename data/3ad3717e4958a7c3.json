  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Order and morality reign supreme in a Japan that has eradicated all forms of obscenity, thanks to stringent laws and special devices that monitor citizens. In this puritanical society, Tanukichi Okuma, the son of a notorious terrorist who opposed these laws, finds himself enrolled in a prestigious public morals school. Hoping to reconnect with his childhood crush, Anna Nishikinomiya, the student council president, he offers his assistance to the council.\n\nHowever, his ordinary school life takes a dramatic turn when Ayame Kajou, the vice president, secretly known as Blue Snow, coerces him into joining SOX, an organization dedicated to spreading lewd material and challenging the oppressive government. Caught in a whirlwind of obscene acts of rebellion, Tanukichi must navigate this dangerous path while trying to protect his feelings for Anna, who is unknowingly the primary target of their lewd revolution. Will Tanukichi manage to balance his loyalty to SOX and his love for Anna, all while fighting against the country's strict moral code?",
