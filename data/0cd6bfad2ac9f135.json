    "text": "Crystania, a magical land once at peace, faces grave danger as seals protecting the realm begin deteriorating. Nightmares manifest, unleashing tornadoes, basilisks, dragons, and other terrors that scar the land and destroy villages. The chaos signals the impending return of the evil God-King Barbas, previously defeated by warriors including the valiant Ashram. But Ashram remains trapped in the nightmarish World of Chaos, his only hope a portal back home. Ashram's beloved Pirotess, reborn as Lady Sheru, is haunted by dreams of Ashram's torment. Determined to save him, Sheru seeks the Chaos Ring, an artifact that can open a portal while also delaying Barbas’ resurrection. Meanwhile, the heroic Redon has dreams warning that Barbas’ followers now plot his return. As mythical beasts run rampant, Redon pursues the awakening Bell to stem the tide of chaos. Pirotess and Redon reunite on a perilous quest to free Ashram’s soul and wield the Chaos Ring’s power, before Barbas returns to bring Crystania to ruin. With the land and its gods at risk, these heroes carry the fate of Crystania on their shoulders once again.",
