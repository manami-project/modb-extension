    "text": "Fleeing from slave traders, a young girl named Hifumi accidentally falls off a cliff and is caught by Sakamaki Izayoi, who is traveling with companions Kasukabe You and Kudou Asuka. Calling themselves the \"No Names,\" this capable trio protects Hifumi and defeats her pursuers. Hifumi has a special ability to locate water sources, which is valuable to her drought-stricken village. At the village's dried-up hot spring, Izayoi, You, Asuka, and Hifumi meet up with their friends Kuro Usagi, Lili, and Letitia. The village chief then proposes a high-stakes \"Gift Game\" with the coveted hot spring as the prize. If the No Names win, they earn the right to relax in the newly flowing baths. But first they must overcome a series of unpredictable challenges devised by their opponent, Jack-O-Lantern. With their powers and wits combined, the No Names set out to win the game and restore the precious hot spring to the villagers. But their foes won't make it easy, ensuring tricks, trials, and triumphs lie ahead.",
