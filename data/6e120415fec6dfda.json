    "text": "Association(JAniCA) as part of the Young Animator Training Project, Tansu Warashi follows the story of Noeru Hiragi, a young office worker living a mundane life in the city. One day, Noeru receives an unexpected delivery from her mother - an old, bulky wardrobe that doesn't quite fit in her small apartment. However, the wardrobe turns out to be more than just a piece of furniture. It is home to six mysterious children who claim to serve the current mistress of the Hiragi household - Noeru herself.\n\nAs Noeru returns home one night after a few drinks, she encounters a strange boy in her apartment, snacking on her rice crackers. Initially dismissing it as a drunken hallucination, Noeru soon realizes that the boy and his five companions are very real, and they have taken it upon themselves to keep her apartment clean and cook her meals.\n\nWhile Noeru struggles to adapt to her new living situation, she learns the value of a well-kept household and the joy of having company. However, she can't help but wonder who these children really are and why they have chosen to serve her. As she uncovers the secrets of the wardrobe and its inhabitants, Noeru embarks on a heartwarming journey of self-discovery and friendship.",
