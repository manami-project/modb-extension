    "text": "And so begins the thrilling new season of Bakugan, set in the VESTROIAN star system, a cosmic neighborhood of six unique planets, each hosting a distinct species of Bakugan: Avian, Dragon, Insect, Mammal, Aquatic, and Dino. Amidst their relentless interplanetary conflicts, an experimental weapon gone awry catapults the Bakugan to Earth, where they make their grand entrance as Baku-Balls plummeting from the heavens like celestial fireworks.\n\nUpon unrolling, these Baku-Balls reveal the awe-inspiring, 10-feet-tall Bakugan to the human population for the first time. Initially, people embrace these displaced creatures, cherishing their culture and delighting in their age-old brawling customs. However, when teenagers form partnerships with the Bakugan, a remarkable transformation occurs: the Bakugan evolve into colossal, Kaiju-sized entities, igniting fear across the globe. It is during this tumultuous period that an event known as the Catastrophe unfolds, forever altering the course of human and Bakugan history.",
