    "text": "The exciting new season of Bakugan takes place in the VESTROIAN star system, home to six different planets and species of Bakugan. These Bakugan species - Avian, Dragon, Insect, Mammal, Aquatic and Dinosaur - are constantly at war with one another. Their conflicts lead them to utilize dangerous experimental weapons that inadvertently transport the Bakugan across the galaxy to planet Earth. Mysterious Baku-balls rain down from the sky, crashing into cities, forests and oceans across the world. As the balls unroll, humans meet the 10-foot-tall Bakugan for the first time. Thankfully, humanity welcomes the displaced creatures and embraces their culture, especially their tradition of Bakugan battling known as \"Brawling\". Things take a concerning turn as teenagers start to form powerful bonds and pair up with Bakugan. This gives the Bakugan the miraculous ability to grow into giant Kaiju-sized monsters. A wave of fear spreads across the world in response. It is during this chaotic time that a cataclysmic event called \"The Catastrophe\" comes to pass.",
