    "text": "In a world where grains are personified as students, the stage is set at the prestigious Kokuritsu Inaho Academy, a school teetering on the brink of closure. The 'Harvest Show,' a grand event where grains showcase their charm, is the heart of the academy. However, in this era of Westernization and dwindling rice cultivation, bread, led by the charismatic 'Yeast King,' reigns supreme.\n\nEnter 'Love Rice,' a group of five spirited rice-inspired students, who are determined to reclaim the lost glory of rice, Japan's soul food. Their mission: to outshine 'Yeast King' at the Harvest Show and rekindle the love for rice among their fellow students. As they embark on this journey, laughter, camaraderie, and passion ensue, promising a heartwarming 'kome'dy that will make you fall in love with rice all over again. Who will be the ultimate HarveStar? Only time will tell.",
