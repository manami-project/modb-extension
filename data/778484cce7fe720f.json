This spirited group of middle school girls, led by their enthusiastic but unskilled captain, Chitose Akiyama, have set their sights on making it to the nationals. The team includes Asuna Harukaze, a farm girl with a love for tennis and a strange sense of logic, Kotone Sawanatsu, a karate expert with a violent streak, Kurusu Fuyukawa, a talented soft tennis player with a penchant for wearing masks, and Elizabeth Warren, a skilled British exchange student with a crush on their coach. With their quirky personalities and varying skill levels, the road to the tournament will be a challenging one. But with the guidance of their former tennis prodigy turned teacher, Mishimagi You, the team just might have what it takes to emerge victorious. Will they be able to overcome their individual weaknesses and work together to bring home the trophy in their final year of middle school? Only time will tell in this hilarious and heartwarming tennis comedy.",
