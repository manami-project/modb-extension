    "text": "Set in the glamorous metropolis of Tokyo Midi City, music and the dream of musical superstardom is everything. Dozens of bands compete in \"battle of the bands\" competitions for the honor of performing at the top of the city's highest tower. A Gothic Lolita-clad catgirl named Cyan stumbles into the music world and is inspired by the dream of fame. She joins forces with three other aspiring musicians - honor student bunnygirl Chuchu, shy doggirl Retoree, and adorable sheepgirl Moa. Together they form the band Plasmagica. Armed with special instruments, Plasmagica faces off against other bands striving for stardom, like the cool and passionate visual kei band Shingan Crimsonz and the handsome pop idols Trichronika. After defending the musical haven of Midi City from evil forces once before, Plasmagica must do so again when a villain named Dagger returns with the ominous Queen of Darkness. Will Cyan and her bandmates be able to save the city and its music scene once more?",
