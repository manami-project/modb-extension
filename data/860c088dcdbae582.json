  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the future, Earth's resources are depleted and humanity looks to the newly discovered tenth planet, Promete, for survival. However, an initial exploration mission ends in tragedy when one of the pilots, Takuma's father Dantetsu, betrays the team and causes the ships to be destroyed. Dantetsu then disappears. Years later, the insane former scientist Chancellor Doppler declares himself ruler of Promete and forbids anyone from approaching, believing only he is entitled to the planet's resources. To take back control of Promete, Earth governments start building giant combat robots. Doppler destroys them all except Danguard Ace. A mysterious captain named Dan helps defend Danguard's base from Doppler's mecha forces, though his past association with Doppler while brainwashed remains unknown. Takuma joins the Danguard Ace program as a cadet, hoping to clear his family name and honor his father by fighting Doppler's occupation of Promete. Takuma trains at Jasdam Base where Danguard Ace, an incredible transforming robot that Takuma is set to pilot, is under construction. Will Takuma succeed in this mission to Promete where his father failed years ago? Can he defeat Doppler and restore his family's honor?",
