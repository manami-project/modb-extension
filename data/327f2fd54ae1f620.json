    "text": "This engaging anime follows the journey of Noir Stalgia, a young man from a noble family who finds himself at the bottom of the social ladder. Despite his lineage, Noir struggles to find employment and is treated with disdain by his peers. However, he possesses a unique ability to communicate with a wise sage who provides him with guidance and advice.\n\nAfter losing a job opportunity, Noir seeks the sage's counsel and is led to a secret dungeon filled with mysterious objects, dangerous creatures, and immense power. In this hidden realm, Noir discovers he has the ability to create, bestow, and edit skills, but using these powers comes with a catch - he must indulge in worldly pleasures to replenish his energy.\n\nDetermined to change his fate, Noir enrolls in the Hero Academy to hone his skills and become stronger. Along the way, he encounters Olivia Servant, a beautiful maiden trapped within the dungeon, who grants him a set of incredibly powerful skills. With his newfound abilities, Noir navigates through the challenges of the academy, forms new alliances, and helps his companions overcome the obstacles they face.\n\nJoin Noir as he embarks on a thrilling adventure filled with danger, power, and romance, all while striving to rise above his circumstances and create a better future for himself.",
