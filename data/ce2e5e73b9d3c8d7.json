    "text": "Hell ish earthquakes have ravaged the Kanto region, plunging the once-thriving metropolis into a lawless, post-apocalyptic wasteland. Amidst the chaos, a ruthless figure known as the Slum King emerges, seizing power and forcing captured women into a life of servitude as sex slaves. One such woman is Mari, who finds herself ensnared in the Slum King's cruel grasp while searching for her missing lover, Ken.\n\nIn a surprising turn of events, Ken, now a member of the Slum King's gang, attempts to rescue Mari from her torment. However, the Slum King presents a twisted ultimatum: in exchange for Mari's freedom, Ken must eliminate the Slum King's formidable adversary, the enigmatic and powerful Violence Jack. As Mari's fate hangs in the balance, Ken must confront the impossible task set before him in this unforgiving, brutal world.",
