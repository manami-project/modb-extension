  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This is the tale of Cid, an ordinary boy with an extraordinary dream: to become the enigmatic puppet master who manipulates the world from the shadows, rather than being the hero or villain in the spotlight. Reborn into a new world, Cid seizes the opportunity to realize his ambitions by establishing the Shadow Garden, a secret organization that he claims is dedicated to combating an evil cult conjured from his vivid imagination.\n\nHowever, in a twist of fate, the cult that Cid fabricated turns out to be a real and formidable enemy. As the leader of the Shadow Garden, Cid unwittingly finds himself at the center of a battle against darkness, with his followers believing in his made-up persona as the powerful 'Eminence in Shadow.'\n\nCid's journey is a thrilling rollercoaster of comedy, action, and misdirection, as he navigates the fine line between his fantasy and reality. Will he be able to maintain his facade and lead his followers to victory, or will the truth behind his imaginary cult unravel his master plan? Join Cid and his Shadow Garden as they embark on a series of epic adventures in a world where the line between fact and fiction blurs.",
