    "text": "Cid is a young man who dreams of becoming a powerful mastermind that operates from the shadows. Though in his past life he was just an ordinary human, Cid is reborn into a fantasy world where magic exists. Seizing this new opportunity, Cid establishes a secret organization called Shadow Garden and pretends they are battling an imaginary evil cult he made up, as part of his fantasy to become the ultimate \"Eminence in Shadow.\" He recruits some followers to go along with his charade. However, Cid soon discovers that the fictional cult he imagined actually exists in this world. To his surprise, the cultists start attacking Cid and his followers, displeased that his fantasy organization has interfered with the cult's real plans. Now Cid finds himself accidentally embroiled in a very real battle between Shadow Garden and the mysterious Cult of Diablos. Though initially living out a self-indulgent power fantasy, Cid shows potential to grow into the mastermind leader he always aspired to be.",
