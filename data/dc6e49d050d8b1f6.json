    "text": "She is a 17-year-old descendant of a lineage of witches, living in a world where magic subtly intertwines with daily life. Yet, Hitomi Tsukishiro's world is far from vibrant. Having lost her ability to perceive color at a tender age, she has grown into an emotionally distant teenager. In a bid to change her granddaughter's fate, Kohaku, a powerful witch, casts a spell to send Hitomi back in time to the year 2018.\n\nIn this unfamiliar era, Hitomi encounters her grandmother's younger self and her club members, sparking a journey of self-discovery and personal growth. Among these new acquaintances, she stumbles upon the captivating artwork of a young man named Yuito Aoi. His drawings mysteriously restore color to Hitomi's monochromatic world, igniting a surge of emotions within her.\n\nAs Hitomi finds herself drawn to Yuito, she stands on the brink of a profound transformation. But why do Yuito's drawings have such a profound impact on her? And what is the true purpose behind Kohaku's decision to send her granddaughter back in time? As Hitomi navigates this new world, she embarks on a journey to regain her lost magic and rediscover the vibrant hues of life.",
