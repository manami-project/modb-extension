    "text": "Osawa Mikio, a timid fifth-grader residing in the outskirts of Osaka, finds himself smitten by his classmate, the charming Haruko Tezuka. Struggling with shyness, Mikio finds it difficult to express his feelings to Haruko. When Mikio's bespectacled friend, Megane, shares the news of Haruko's impending move to another town, Mikio must gather the courage to confess his love before it's too late.\n\nKaede Newtown, a heartwarming romantic comedy animation, is the brainchild of Osaka native and talented illustrator Naoto Iwakiri. Accompanied by a nostalgic soundtrack from Japanese band The Aprils and singer-songwriter TOMOVSKY, this tale of first love transports viewers back to the cherished memories of their childhood hometowns. With adorable characters and relatable situations, Kaede Newtown promises a delightful and engaging watch.",
