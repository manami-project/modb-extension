    "text": "He once ruled as the Demon King Anos Voldigoad, a tyrant who eradicated humans, spirits, and gods, seeking endless warfare. But after growing weary of the chaos, he yearned for peace and chose to reincarnate in the future. Upon awakening two millennia later, Anos discovers a world that has grown too accustomed to tranquility, resulting in weakened descendants and diminished magic. To reclaim his rightful place, he enrolls in the prestigious Demon King Academy, only to find that his extraordinary powers are beyond the academy's comprehension. Labeled a misfit, Anos must navigate through the demonic hierarchy with the support of his lone ally, Misha, to uncover the truth behind his misrepresented legacy and reassert his dominance as the true Demon King.",
