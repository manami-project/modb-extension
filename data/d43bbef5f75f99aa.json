  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A young woman reminisces fondly about her first love from childhood. They met in elementary school and quickly became inseparable, spending carefree afternoons walking home together. However, they were split apart when he had to move away unexpectedly. She felt his absence deeply, clinging to the hope that their paths would cross again. Now an adult, she still reflects on that innocent romance from her youth. The time they shared was fleeting, but it shaped her profoundly, defining her concept of relationships for years to come. Though their story ended abruptly, she continues to cherish the joy and wonder of those days. Her heart still flutters at the memory of laughing together as they made up silly songs. Ultimately, she realizes that nothing lasts forever. People come into our lives for but a season. Yet the traces they leave, however faint, continue rippling through us. She's grateful for having loved and having been loved, if only for a moment. That boy will always be her first love.",
