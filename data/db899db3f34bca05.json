    "text": "Seikichi Kitano, a first-year high school student, is a gentle soul with an unfortunate appearance that makes him look like a devil. Despite his kind heart, he is constantly misunderstood and feared by everyone around him. His intimidating looks and unintentional defeat of the school's guardian lead him to become the most infamous gang leader in town. Along with his loyal followers, Kuroda and Takehisa, Kitano navigates through a world of drugs and crime, trying to make a positive impact without resorting to violence. Despite the challenges posed by his poor communication skills and terrifying appearance, Kitano's innate fighting abilities and pure intentions help him make friends in the most unexpected ways, as he strives to protect his school and prove that appearances can be deceiving. This is the story of \"Angel Densetsu,\" where a pacifist with a frightening exterior embarks on a journey to change the world around him.",
