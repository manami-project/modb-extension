  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime unfolds the chilling tale of an enigmatic, jet-black garbage truck that materializes unexpectedly, seemingly out of thin air. Contrary to its typical role of collecting trash or discarded household items, this peculiar vehicle targets 'useless' individuals, whisking them away for an unknown fate. The narrative weaves an intricate web of 'urban legend horror' through the diverse accounts of these individuals and their unsettling brushes with the sinister truck.",
