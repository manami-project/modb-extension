  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A sinister black garbage truck prowls the streets, driven by an unseen entity. Its purpose: seeking out individuals deemed \"useless\" by society. Rather than collecting refuse, this spectral vehicle preys upon human lives. As urban legend tells, once marked by the truck, hapless targets vanish without a trace. Through interwoven tales, the manga explores the fates of those marked for elimination. Each story reveals another person society has cast off - the lonely, the marginalized, the broken. Yet not all succumb willingly to their judgement. Some fight their destiny while others seek meaning in their end. This horror anthology brings our fears of the forgotten to the fore. Who determines human worth? Do we deserve a second chance? Ominous as shadows, the black truck watches, ever hungry for society's unwanted. Its verdict is final. There are no appeals for the ones it takes.",
