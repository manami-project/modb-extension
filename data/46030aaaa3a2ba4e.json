    "text": "Little does he know it, but Narumi Fujishima's life is about to take a dramatic turn. As a high school student who struggles to connect with his peers, Narumi finds himself unexpectedly joining the school's gardening club at the behest of his classmate Ayaka. But this is no ordinary gardening club, and Ayaka is no ordinary classmate. She introduces Narumi to Alice, a reclusive and eccentric young woman who lives above a ramen shop and runs her own private detective agency. Alice is a NEET, someone who is not in education, employment, or training, but she is far from idle. With her exceptional hacking skills and a team of fellow NEETs at her disposal, Alice takes on cases that the police can't or won't handle. Narumi is soon drawn into Alice's world of danger and intrigue, as he becomes an assistant to the agency and finds himself facing off against gangs, thieves, and murderers. But as he delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding a dangerous new drug called Angel Fix, Narumi realizes that his involvement with Alice and the NEETs could put him and Ayaka in grave danger. With its quirky characters, thrilling action, and intricate plot, Heaven's Memo Pad is a gripping anime that will keep you on the edge of your seat.",
