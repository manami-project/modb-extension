    "text": "Yorn is a young boy who dreams of uncovering the mysteries of two massive floating cities in the sky called the Edens. His life is suddenly turned upside down when assassins murder his father, and Yorn learns that he is next on their hit list. As Yorn races to find his long-lost mother and the truth behind the attacks, he discovers that legends portray him as the reincarnation of the God Hunter - a heroic figure who once defeated the gods and now threatens the technological overlords of the Edens. With the help of an old man and a mysterious young girl named Elisiss, Yorn begins to develop strange new powers and acquires the God Hunter's legendary sword. However, Elisiss hides a shocking secret about her true identity that could be too much for Yorn to handle. Pursued by dangerous inhabitants of the Edens who will stop at nothing to eliminate the new God Hunter, Yorn and Elisiss must learn to work together as they attempt to evade capture and unlock the mystery of Yorn's destiny. Their choices could liberate humanity or doom civilization.",
