    "text": "Alto is a student at the prestigious Royal Ortigia Magic Academy who is struggling academically and at risk of failing his summoning class. In a last ditch effort to pass, Alto finds an ancient spellbook and accidentally summons the powerful demoness Vermeil. As part of their contract, Vermeil agrees to become Alto's familiar to help salvage his grades. However, in order to recharge her magical powers, she must kiss Alto passionately every day - much to the dismay of Alto's jealous childhood friend Lilia. Now, with the legendary she-devil by his side, Alto has a chance to turn his grades around. But Vermeil's destructive magic and intimate payment cause chaos, drawing suspicious looks from other students and teachers. Alto must harness Vermeil's power wisely while navigating relationships with Lilia and his other classmates.",
