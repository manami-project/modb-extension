    "text": "As an amateur magician at the esteemed Royal Ortigia Magic Academy, Alto Goldfield finds himself on the brink of repeating the year due to his lackluster performance in summoning class. In a last-ditch effort to salvage his academic standing, Alto stumbles upon an ancient spellbook containing a forbidden summoning ritual. Unbeknownst to him, the ritual unleashes the formidable and seductive demoness, Vermeil, who has been trapped for eons.\n\nTo maintain her newly-found freedom and replenish her magical powers, Vermeil demands a daily, intimate kiss from her summoner, Alto. As their peculiar relationship unfolds, Alto must navigate the challenges of balancing his academic life, managing Vermeil's mysterious past, and dealing with the growing suspicions of his classmates - especially his childhood friend, Lilia, who harbors jealousy towards the enigmatic demoness.\n\nEmbark on a thrilling journey as Alto and Vermeil traverse the trials and tribulations of the magical academy, forging an unbreakable bond that will ultimately determine their fates.",
