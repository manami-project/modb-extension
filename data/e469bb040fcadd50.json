    "text": "Kokutou Mikiya lies in a coma, and a series of inexplicable schoolgirl suicides plague a city, all linked to the soon-to-be-demolished Fujou Building. Sensing a sinister connection, Shiki Ryougi embarks on a perilous journey to the building to save her friend and unravel the enigma. There, she encounters Kirie Fujou, the bedridden, terminally ill girl who has mysteriously acquired a spiritual form. As Shiki delves deeper into the darkness, she finds herself dangerously close to becoming the next victim or the city's savior.\n\nSet in September 1998, this gripping tale of supernatural suspense follows Shiki, gifted with the Mystic Eyes of Death Perception, as she and her partner Mikiya investigate the unsettling series of suicides under the guidance of Touko Aozaki, a magus and head of a paranormal detective agency. As they explore the eerie Fujou Building, they uncover a chilling truth that binds the victims together and threatens to consume Shiki herself. Can she solve the mystery before it's too late, or will she succumb to the darkness that surrounds her? This is the first chapter in the seven-part movie series, Kara no Kyoukai.",
