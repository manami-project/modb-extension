    "text": "Prairie-inspired yet distinctly unique, Charlotte's tale unfolds in the serene landscapes of Quebec, Canada. Raised on a lush ranch by her doting father, a former French aristocrat, Charlotte's blissful existence is enveloped by the love of her father and the companionship of the farm animals. However, on her 12th birthday, her world is turned upside down when a mysterious package from her supposedly deceased mother arrives. As her father passes away and her mother enters her life, Charlotte is left to navigate a series of heart-rending challenges, including the arrival of a peculiar boy and the sinister intentions of a landowner eyeing her father's farm. Despite the seemingly insurmountable obstacles, Charlotte's resilient spirit and inherent optimism ultimately triumph, leading her to rediscover happiness in the most unexpected ways.",
