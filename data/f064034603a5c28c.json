    "text": "Black Jack, a gifted but unlicensed doctor, realizes he has forgotten his medical kit and relies on his spunky assistant Pinoko to deliver it to him. Eager to help, Pinoko heads out but soon finds herself lost in a strange forest filled with injured and ailing animals. Guided by a butterfly, Pinoko comes across deer, bears, and other forest creatures in need of medical attention. Drawing from the medical knowledge she has gained while assisting Black Jack, Pinoko begins mending wounds and tending to the sick animals. Though inexperienced, her treatments and tireless caregiving earn the animals’ trust. However, Pinoko faces her greatest challenge when she encounters an animal in critical condition. Summoning all her courage and utilizing every bit of knowledge from Black Jack, Pinoko works desperately to heal the animal. Her medical skills are put to the test as she races against time to stabilize the patient. Through her forest adventures, Pinoko proves herself to be a compassionate healer like her mentor, finding ways to assist creatures great and small. Though the forest animals still need Black Jack’s expert skills, Pinoko’s quick thinking and dedication shine through as she lends them a helping hand. Her journey both reunites her with Black Jack and reaffirms her resolve to one day become a doctor herself.",
