    "text": "Somewhere in the digital abyss, a website known as HellCorrespondence.com lurks, accessible only at the stroke of midnight. This is not an ordinary site; it is a gateway to vengeance. By entering the name of the person who has wronged you, you summon Ai Enma, the enigmatic Hell Girl. Ai Enma promises to exact revenge on your behalf, sending the soul of your tormentor straight to hell. But this vengeance comes at a steep price: when your own life ends, your soul will also be bound for hell, forever forfeiting the possibility of paradise. Despite the grim consequences, those consumed by resentment continue to seek out the Hell Girl, fueling her eternal mission of retribution.",
