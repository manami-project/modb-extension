  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chise Hatori, a 15-year-old girl, has experienced a life filled with neglect, abuse, and despair, with no semblance of love or family. Just as all hope seems to vanish, a turning point arrives when she is purchased at a slave auction by Elias, a non-human sorcerer with a beast-like head and extraordinary powers. As Chise embarks on a new journey as Elias' apprentice and future wife, she receives a package from Angelica containing magical study materials and a surprising gift: a children's picture book from her past.\n\nThis book holds a special place in Chise's heart, as it reminds her of a magical library hidden deep within the forest that once provided solace during her troubled childhood. As she shares the story behind the book with Elias, Chise recounts the friendship she formed with the magician of the forest, Miura-san, which left a lasting impact on her life.\n\nThis three-part OVA series explores the events leading up to Chise's fateful encounter with the Thorn Sorcerer, delving into her heartwarming connection with the magical library and the enigmatic Miura-san.",
