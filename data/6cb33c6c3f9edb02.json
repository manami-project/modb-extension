    "text": "Nippon TV's 40th anniversary brought forth a charming commercial, \"Sorairo no Tane,\" produced by the renowned Studio Ghibli in 1992. Based on a heartwarming 1964 Japanese children's book penned by Nakagawa Rieko and illustrated by Oomura Yuriko, this short TV advertisement beautifully encapsulates the enchanting tale of a young boy and his extraordinary encounter with a fox.\n\nOne fateful day, the boy exchanges his beloved toy airplane for a peculiar, sky-blue seed offered by the fox. Little does he know that this simple act of trading would lead to a miraculous transformation. The boy plants the seed, which, over time, blossoms into a magnificent house that serves as a haven for a myriad of animals and children.\n\nAs the house thrives with joy and laughter, the fox reappears, returning the boy's toy airplane. In a surprising turn of events, the fox enters the house, only for it to disintegrate shortly after. This poignant tale of friendship and growth unfolds in a captivating one-and-a-half-hour film, inviting viewers to embark on a magical journey filled with wonder and warmth.",
