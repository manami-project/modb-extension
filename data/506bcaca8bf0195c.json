    "text": "Kanon's life has taken a new turn as she pursues her passion for oceanography, leading her back to Amamiko Island for the summer. Meanwhile, Marin and her underwater companions discover a lost sea cow, sparking a mission to reunite the baby with its mother.\n\nIn the depths of the sea, Marin and her sister Urin yearn for a life beyond the water's surface. When a mysterious ring descends into their world, the sisters embark on a journey to return it, ultimately arriving on a secluded island where they meet Kanon. The encounter between these two maidens from different realms - one of the sea and one of the skies - uncovers a hidden power as darkness looms over their world.\n\nA year has passed since their initial meeting, and Kanon can't help but wonder if Marin's life has also changed. As the girls come together once more, they navigate through new challenges and experiences, forging a bond that transcends the boundaries between land and sea.",
