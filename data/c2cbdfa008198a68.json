  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane are the elite student leaders at the prestigious Shuchiin Academy. Though they seem perfect for each other, both are too proud to confess their true feelings and be the \"loser\" in love. And so begins their daily schemes to force the other's hand - whether through suggestion, manipulation, or outright trickery. It's all out psychological warfare as these two geniuses battle to get their crush to crack first. Will the earnest Miyuki manage to break through Kaguya's icy facade? Or will the cunning Kaguya ensnare the diligent president in her web? In the end, the winner of this war will lose their pride but gain the love they so desperately crave. Love is a battlefield in \"Kaguya-sama: Love is War,\" a witty romantic comedy that satirizes the silly social games of the young elite. Egos will be bruised and hearts laid bare as two master manipulators fight to confess their love first.",
