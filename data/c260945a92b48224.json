  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The lives of four seemingly ordinary 8th grade friends at an all-girls school take a turn for the extraordinary as each hides a monumental secret. Rikka, Chiyo, Sekine, and Tsubasa, despite their close bond, are unaware of each other's true identities: an alien, a ninja without a clan, a girl with supernatural powers, and a boy disguised as a girl. As they navigate through the challenges of middle school, they must also invent creative ways to conceal their secrets, leading to a series of hilarious and wild adventures. Amidst the chaos, they must protect not only their friendship but also their classroom and the Earth itself from impending danger. Will they succeed in keeping their true selves hidden while saving the world? Only time will tell.",
