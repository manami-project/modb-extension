  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Delivery company Inazma, based in the bustling Babiden City, is renowned for its commitment to ensure every package reaches its intended recipient. Hemingway, a dedicated employee, finds his routine delivery tasks taking an unexpected turn when he encounters Bytheway, an alien child clad in a shark costume, hailing from a distant planet.\n\nIntriguingly, Inazma's delivery stages span across diverse streets from all corners of the globe, and Hemingway, now accompanied by the enigmatic alien Visorway, embarks on a mission to return Bytheway's visor to his home star.\n\nAs Hemingway strives to fulfill his promise to deliver Bytheway back to his home planet, the alien child ends up becoming his roommate. Their daily lives unfold into a series of adventures, with Hemingway navigating through his delivery tasks, such as disposing of batteries, while Bytheway, donning a floatie ring, joyfully tags along, much to Hemingway's bemusement.",
