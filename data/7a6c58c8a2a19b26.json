  "synopsis": {
    "text": "All Rakka knows is the sensation of falling, followed by an awakening in a strange world. She finds herself in a town called Grie, surrounded by massive walls and inhabited by beings known as Haibane, who possess small gray wings and bright halos. Rakka, now one of them, must navigate the mysteries of this new existence, bound by rules that forbid her from approaching the walls or leaving the town. As she grapples with her new reality, Rakka embarks on a journey of self-discovery, seeking to understand the purpose of the Haibane and the secrets hidden beyond the forbidden walls. But the path to enlightenment is fraught with challenges, as failure could mark her as Sin-bound. Join Rakka in her quest for truth, as she strives to reach the ultimate goal of every Haibane: to ascend beyond the walls on their Day of Flight.",
