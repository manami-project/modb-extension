    "text": "As the Taisho era unfolds, Mameda, a young and ambitious tanuki, embarks on a journey to Osaka with a singular dream: to master the art of transforming into a human and tricking others. However, the rapid advancement of technology has left her fellow tanukis' mischievous antics ineffective, and Mameda quickly finds herself struggling to deceive even a single person.\n\nOne day, Mameda stumbles upon a captivating rakugo performance by the esteemed Bunko Daikokutei. Enthralled by the vivid storytelling and the ability to create illusions through words, Mameda becomes determined to learn this art form. Despite Bunko's initial hesitation to accept an apprentice, Mameda's unwavering perseverance eventually convinces her to take the young tanuki under her wing.\n\nNow, Mameda must juggle her taiko apprenticeship, theater work, and the arduous task of memorizing plays in order to master rakugoâ€”the one remaining art that can still captivate and deceive people. Little does she know, her mentor Bunko also hides a supernatural secret, adding an unexpected layer to Mameda's pursuit of becoming a true rakugo artist.",
