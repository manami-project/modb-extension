  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earth became the unwilling recipient of a cosmic catastrophe when the remnants of a distant planet, Kumalia, rained down upon it as a dazzling meteor shower. In the aftermath of this celestial event, an inexplicable transformation occurred among the planet's ursine inhabitants. Once peaceful bears morphed into aggressive predators, hellbent on devouring humans.\n\nThe relentless onslaught of bear attacks prompted humanity to retaliate, leading to a seemingly endless cycle of violence. To restore peace and safeguard both species, a colossal barrier, christened the 'Wall of Severance', was erected to segregate humans and bears.\n\nThe narrative unfolds at Arashigaoka Academy, where two young lovers, Kureha Tsubasa and Sumika Izumino, find their bond under threat. Two bears, Ginko Yurishiro and Lulu Yurigasaki, have breached the Wall of Severance, infiltrating the academy and displaying an uncanny interest in Kureha.\n\nAs the 'Bear Alarm' blares, signaling the presence of these intruders, the girls are thrust into a maelstrom of secrets, challenges, and self-discovery. The Invisible Storm, a group entrusted with maintaining order within the academy, subjects the girls to a trial, forcing them to confront their feelings and embark on a journey to attain the elusive 'promised kiss' of true love.",
