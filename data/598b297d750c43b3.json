    "text": "Tomorrowâ€™s Leaves, an animated short film, is a captivating tale of five young envoys hailing from diverse lands, united by a common mission. Commissioned by the Olympic Foundation for Culture and Heritage and animated by Studio Ponoc, this film was created to celebrate the Olympic spirit and to emphasize the values of excellence, friendship, and respect. The story unfolds as the annual message leaf, known for its vibrant and enduring colors, inexplicably begins to fade and crumble, sparking concern. The envoys, guided by tiny spirits, embark on a journey to unravel the mystery behind the message leaf's sudden deterioration.\n\nAs they traverse challenging terrains and face difficult conditions, the envoys discover the power of unity, competition, and sportsmanship. Each envoy brings unique strengths and vulnerabilities to the table, and they learn to compete and support each other, embodying the true spirit of the Olympics. The film premiered at the Annecy International Animated Film Festival as part of the cultural program for Tokyo 2020, aiming to engage a broader international audience and reinforce the links between sport, culture, and education that are fundamental to the Olympic Movement. Will the envoys be able to restore life to the message leaf and secure a future in peril? Join them on their journey to find out.",
