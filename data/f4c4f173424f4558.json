  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yoake Luffy's adventures unfold in this alternate reality adaptation of the Romance Dawn arc, marking the 20th anniversary of the One Piece TV anime broadcast. While navigating the vast sea solo, a mysterious bird collides with Luffy's modest boat. Glancing up, he spots a colossal ship harboring a captive girl named Ann, who appears to be the bird's owner. This tale is not derived from Eiichirou Oda's prototype manga, but rather, it covers the Romance Dawn arc from the original manga, signifying the beginning of Luffy's pirate escapades in the East Blue. Initially bundled with the PSP pirate romance role-playing game One Piece Romance Dawn: Bouken no Yoake, this anime promises a thrilling journey for both seasoned and new One Piece fans.",
