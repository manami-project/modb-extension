  "synopsis": {
    "text": "He's just an ordinary boy living on the peaceful Sentan Island, caught between his separated parents and the simple joys of school life. But when Akiyuki Takehara becomes an unwitting victim of a sudden explosion, his world is forever changed. The blast leaves him with a strange power coursing through his veins, transforming him into the enigmatic Xam'd, a creature of immense strength and mystery. As he grapples with his newfound abilities, he encounters a white-haired girl who seems to hold the key to his transformation, and a red-haired girl, Nakiami, who saves him from the brink of despair.\n\nNow, aboard a postal vessel, Akiyuki embarks on a journey to understand the power within him and seek a way back to his loved ones. Along the way, he finds himself entangled in a world torn apart by the Northern Government and the Southern Continent Free Zone, where he must confront the Humanforms, the latest weapons of war. As he navigates through the chaos, Akiyuki forges new friendships and discovers the true extent of his power, all while yearning for the peaceful island life he once knew. In this world where flesh and metal collide, Akiyuki's destiny unfolds, shaped by desire, destiny, and the memories locked within Xam'd.",
