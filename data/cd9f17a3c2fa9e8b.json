    "text": "Luckily stumbling upon a classmate in a compromising situation, Nozomi Komine saves the day for Suga Kimio, who found himself trapped in a gym locker as the girls' PE class returned. Despite his innocent intentions, Kimio's relief is short-lived as Nozomi, seemingly a shy and demure girl, seizes the opportunity to blackmail him. Living in the same apartment complex, Nozomi coerces Kimio into a bizarre agreement: they must expose their 'true selves' to each other through their windows. As Nozomi's fascination with human reactions grows, Kimio must navigate this peculiar predicament to protect his school life from impending doom.",
