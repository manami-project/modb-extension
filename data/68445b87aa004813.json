  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Their mission is set, and the fearless Momotaro leads the charge, accompanied by his loyal and diverse animal squadron. After a triumphant victory at Pearl Harbor, their sights are now set on reclaiming Sulawesi Island from American forces. As they construct their new base, the team is joined by eager new recruits and volunteers, all united under a common goal.\n\nAfter a brief respite at the foot of the majestic Mt. Fuji, a monkey, a dog, a pheasant, and a bear embark on a southward journey under Momotarou's command. As parachutes bloom in the sky, the squadron prepares to take over Onigashima Island. Back home, village children mimic the parachuting troops with joyous enthusiasm, racing towards Mt. Fuji.\n\nThis captivating tale draws inspiration from the beloved 'Peach Boy' character of Japanese folklore. The film showcases the strategic surprise attack on Sulawesi Island, highlighting the heroic actions of the parachute troops. Intertwined with the action, the narrative also portrays Japan's mission to 'liberate Asia', a proclamation made by the Government during that time. The film is punctuated with musical scenes, including a memorable one where Japanese soldiers teach local animals to speak through 'The Song of AIUEO'.",
