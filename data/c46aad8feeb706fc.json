  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the western American city of Snowfield, signs foretell the emergence of a new Holy Grail, an omnipotent wish-granting device. As in past Holy Grail Wars, this prompts Mages (Masters) and their summoned legendary Heroic Spirits (Servants) to battle for control of the Grail in order to have their deepest desires fulfilled. However, this new Holy Grail War is abnormal. The Saber Servant class is missing entirely while impossible Heroic Spirits are being summoned as Servants. Snowfield itself was created specifically as the battleground for this bloody ritual. Behind the scenes, a secretive American organization has engineered their own imperfect version of the Holy Grail War based on past events in Japan. With the ritual warped and driven to madness through such irregularities, Snowfield has become a masquerade where humans and heroes are forced to dance as puppets in a false Holy Grail War masked in deception. Despite these twists, the Masters and Servants gather to wage mystical battle for a prize that could grant any wish imaginable to the victor.",
