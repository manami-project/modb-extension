    "text": "Magus world chaos unfolds as Negi Springfield, accompanied by his student group, Ala Alba, embarks on a quest to find his missing father. Their journey begins in London and leads them to Negi's hometown, as depicted in Ken Akamatsu's manga arc, chapters 184 through 188. However, their arrival in the Magus world is far from smooth; unbeknownst to Negi, several other students have secretly joined them, unaware of the existence of magic. The situation escalates when they are ambushed by Fate Averruncus, a formidable mage, leading to the group's separation across the magical planet. With the odds stacked against him, Negi must rely on his wits and abilities to locate his lost students, confront Fate, and continue his mission to find his father.",
