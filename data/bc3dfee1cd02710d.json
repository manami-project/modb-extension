  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chun Tae-il was a young tailor working in poor conditions at garment factories in 1970s South Korea. As the eldest son of a poor family, he felt compelled to serve as the family's pillar and breadwinner. Witnessing the mistreatment and exploitation of his colleagues, Tae-il could not remain silent. He collaborated with other workers to defend their rights and protest their working conditions, even though they lacked experience with labor movements. Ultimately, Tae-il sacrificed his life for the cause - setting himself on fire in an act of protest against the country's Labor Standards Act and bringing international attention to the plight of South Korea's factory workers. His tragic death ignited the formation of labor unions and workers' rights campaigns across the country. This animated film provides an intimate look at Tae-il's personality and convictions through lyrical storytelling. It depicts the injustice he fought while honoring his selfless courage. The film aims not only to memorialize a patriotic martyr but also to depict an inspiring yet heartbreaking chapter of South Korea's history.",
