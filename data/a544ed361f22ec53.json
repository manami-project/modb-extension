    "text": "Sacred wars of ancient times gave birth to the Elementalors, powerful beings who harness the forces of nature to maintain harmony in the world. In the present day, Kagura, a young man reeling from a devastating family tragedy, discovers that he is an Elementalor with immense power. With his only solace being his dear friend Asami, Kagura's world is upended when she is kidnapped by Lord Shiki, a water Elementalor, who seeks to use her unique abilities to free his imprisoned daughter. To save Asami and prevent Lord Shiki from causing a catastrophic imbalance in nature, Kagura must join forces with other Elementalors and embrace his newfound powers. Based on the manga by Okazaki Takeshi, this anime follows Kagura's journey through love, loss, and self-discovery as he fights to protect the world from the looming threat of the Elementalors.",
