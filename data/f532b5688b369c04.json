  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nobita is frustrated with constantly being scolded at home and school, so he comes up with the idea to run away. His friends Gian, Shizuka, and Suneo also have their own reasons for wanting to leave home. Together with Doraemon, the group uses time travel to escape to Japan 70,000 years in the past, before humans existed. In this primitive era, Doraemon and friends relish their freedom as they build their own private paradise. However, after bidding farewell to return to the present day, they soon discover that a caveman named Kukul from that time period has accidentally traveled to the current era. Kukul informs them that after they left, his Hikari tribe was attacked and kidnapped by the evil Giga Zombie and Kurayami tribe. Feeling responsible, Doraemon and friends embark on an adventure spanning two eras to save the Hikari tribe. This becomes their furthest and most daring runaway yet as they dive into the primitive age to rescue the tribe and confront Giga Zombie. Through this journey across time, Nobita and friends learn important lessons while helping protect the existence of an ancient tribe.",
