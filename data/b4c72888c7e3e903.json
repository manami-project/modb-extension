    "text": "Years ago, Masamune Makabe was a chubby, friendless child, cruelly nicknamed \"Piggy\" by his tormentor, the beautiful and wealthy Aki Adagaki. Now, after years of rigorous self-improvement and transformation, Masamune returns to his hometown as a handsome, charismatic, and athletic high school student. With a single goal in mind, he transfers to Aki's school: to exact sweet revenge by making her fall in love with him and then crushing her heart, just as she once crushed his.\n\nHowever, as Masamune embarks on his vengeful journey, he finds that the path to retribution is not as straightforward as he had initially thought. As he gets closer to Aki, his feelings become more complicated, and his heart begins to desire something other than revenge. To make matters worse, an unknown individual from his past seems to have recognized him, threatening to expose his true identity and ruin his meticulously crafted plan.\n\nWill Masamune be able to successfully enact his revenge on Aki, or will his own heart and mysterious adversaries lead him down an unexpected path? Join Masamune in this thrilling tale of love, vengeance, and self-discovery as he navigates the complexities of high school and his own emotions.",
