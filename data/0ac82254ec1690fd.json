    "text": "More than a century has passed since the Quicksand Disaster plunged Tokyo into chaos, and now the city faces a new threat: the misuse of powerful exoskeletons known as Willwears. Enter \"The Eighth,\" a squad of elite crime-fighters within the 5th Special Public Security Section's 3rd Mobile Assault Division. Equipped with their own Willwear suits, they're tasked with combating the rise of high-tech crime.\n\nLed by the petite but fierce Rin Yamabuki, the team's rash and careless approach to their missions often leaves a trail of collateral damage in their wake, drawing the ire of the press and public alike. But when Assistant Inspector Asami Kazari is assigned to the unit, she discovers a team of skilled and dedicated officers who, despite their unorthodox methods, are committed to protecting the city they love.\n\nAs Kazari works to rehabilitate the team's image and bring them in line with police regulations, she finds herself drawn into their world of high-stakes battles and unexpected adversaries. Can she help \"The Eighth\" find a balance between their duty to serve and their passion for justice? Join them on their thrilling adventures in Active Raid: Kidou Kyoushuushitsu Dai Hachi Gakari.",
