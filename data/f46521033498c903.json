  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tao Tao is a young panda living in a hidden valley in China with his mother. When winter ends, Tao Tao excitedly returns to playing with his friends, including a monkey. Unfortunately, hunters soon invade the valley, and Tao Tao tragically loses his mother. He finds comfort in a new friend, a female panda, but their time together is cut short when the hunters return. Tao Tao is captured and sold to a zoo in Europe. His keeper, Mary, cares for him, but Tao Tao remains homesick. Still, he waits for a chance to escape and hopefully return home one day. Originally produced as a Chinese-Japanese collaboration, the Tao Tao anime series follows the adventures of the titular panda cub. As he plays with his animal companions, Tao Tao also listens to his mother's stories, learning important life lessons. Though faced with hunters and captivity, Tao Tao remains resilient, keeping hope to see his valley again.",
