Determined to save his friend, Yuuichirou dedicates himself to gaining knowledge and power - researching ways to turn vampires back into humans while also training to master his Cursed Gear weapon. Meanwhile, Guren receives word from Kureto that vampire nobles are gathering an army in Nagoya to attack Tokyo in one month's time. In preparation, Guren and his squad, including Yuuichirou, are dispatched to Nagoya for a critical mission to intercept and eliminate the vampires before they can launch their assault. With the decisive battle looming, Yuuichirou races against time to acquire the strength to defeat the vampire nobles and rescue Mikaela from her fate. Both human and vampire lives hang in the balance as the two forces collide in Nagoya.",
