  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the late Edo period of feudal Japan, Shinjuro Tateoka suddenly finds himself thrust into leadership of his father's prestigious swordsmanship school and dojo. Though young and initially not well-respected, Shinjuro is a skilled swordsman dedicated to the \"Katsuzin\" fighting style. After Shinjuro takes over, the dojo struggles to retain students, until several young women join its ranks. Life seems deceptively peaceful, until a series of thefts puts the city on high alert. The Tokugawa government calls upon all prominent dojos, including Shinjuro's, to help patrol and protect. Shinjuro now faces the dual challenge of running the dojo and organizing its fighters, while also confronting a band of thieves with suspected deeper motives. Supported by his childhood friend Koharu and the dojo's female warriors, Shinjuro pursues thieves and rogue samurai alike. As the group uncovers political plots threatening the shogunate, Shinjuro struggles to balance his exciting life among devoted female fighters with the pressing needs of a government in peril.",
