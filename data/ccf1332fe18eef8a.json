    "text": "As Hajime Murata navigates the seemingly mundane routines of middle school life in 2070, he finds himself thrust into a world of interstellar intrigue and extraordinary abilities. When a colossal alien spacecraft descends upon Tokyo, the quiet town of Tenmo is left in a state of disbelief, but not for long. Soon after, a transfer student named Muryou Subaru arrives at Misumaru Middle School, donning an antiquated uniform and harboring a hidden talent for telekinesis and combat.\n\nAs Hajime delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding his new classmate, he uncovers a world where psychic powers are commonplace and a massive white guardian, known as Shingu, defends the city from extraterrestrial threats. As he grapples with the truth, Hajime discovers that his fellow students and even his own town are more intertwined with this cosmic conflict than he ever imagined.\n\nJoin Hajime as he unravels the enigma of Shingu: Secret of the Stellar Wars, a thrilling tale of aliens, starships, and the unassuming heroes who stand between Earth and the unknown.",
