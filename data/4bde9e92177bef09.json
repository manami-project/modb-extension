    "text": "Heavens and the mortal realm are on the brink of collapse due to a dwindling source of energy known as akuto. The Magical Kingdom, floating above the human world, is caught in the midst of a devastating war over the remaining akuto. In a desperate attempt to save both realms, Munto, the Magical King, seeks out Yumemi, a unique thirteen-year-old girl with the extraordinary ability to perceive the floating islands in the sky.\n\nAs the Magical Kingdom teeters on the edge of destruction, the human world faces an imminent transformation into a barren wasteland. Believing Yumemi's hidden powers to be the key to salvation, Munto descends to Earth to enlist her help. Upon meeting the king, Yumemi grapples with the weight of her newfound responsibility not only to her world but also to the heavens above.\n\nWith the fear of such immense power fueling the escalating conflict, can Yumemi's abilities truly mend the broken realms? Embark on a journey with Munto and Yumemi as they strive to restore balance and save both worlds from impending doom.",
