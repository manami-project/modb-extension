    "text": "In 1711, a group of alchemists seeking eternal youth are granted immortality by a mysterious demon, but soon begin disappearing one by one. Realizing the danger of staying together, they scatter across the world. Over 200 years later in 1930s America, these immortal beings have all converged once again, now living varied lives ranging from mafia members and FBI agents to thieves and street gangs. In New York, the ambitious former alchemist Szilard Quates and his assistant Ennis search for the remaining bottles of the elixir of immortality. Meanwhile, young Firo joins the secretive Camorra mafia group, meek Jacuzzi unexpectedly becomes the leader of a gang, and the cheerful thieves Isaac and Miria travel across the country on the legendary transcontinental train the Flying Pussyfoot. On board, terrorists, serial killers, and the mysterious, deadly Rail Tracer all incite chaos as multiple interconnected stories involving the immortals unfold. With their paths crossed once again, the characters must come to terms with the eternal lives they lead and the lasting bonds and consequences created over time.",
