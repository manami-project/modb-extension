    "text": "He avens have finally decided to smile upon Goro, a young man who has been plagued by misfortune all his life. Jobless, penniless, and directionless, his only solace lies in the fond memories of his childhood pets. After yet another failed job interview, a fortune teller prophesizes a change in his luck. Dismissing her words as mere nonsense, Goro is left stunned when three beautiful girls materialize in his apartment, claiming to be his guardian angels.\n\nAs it turns out, these girls are reincarnations of his beloved pets, sent to turn his luck around. But as more girls—a total of twelve—begin to appear, Goro's life becomes anything but simple. Each girl, a reincarnation of a pet that met a tragic end, brings her own set of quirks and challenges, often causing more chaos than good fortune.\n\nIn this whirlwind of supernatural events, Goro must navigate through his newfound relationships with his celestial roommates while fending off four mysterious sacred beasts that have inexplicably set their sights on him. Will Goro's luck finally take a turn for the better, or will this divine intervention prove to be more than he bargained for? Only time will tell in this heartwarming and hilarious tale of luck, love, and loyalty.",
