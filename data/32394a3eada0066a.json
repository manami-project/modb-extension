    "text": "Goro is an unlucky young man who can't seem to hold down a job. As a child, he loved and cared deeply for all of his pets, but they sadly died one by one. Down on his luck once again after getting fired, Goro meets a mysterious fortune teller who gives him a magical cell phone, telling him it will change his fortune. That very night, three cute girls show up in Goro's apartment, claiming to be reincarnations of his dead childhood pets! Over time, twelve in total appear - all here to repay Goro for his kindness by helping him turn his luck around. But living with twelve girls proves chaotic, and the self-proclaimed \"guardian angels\" seem to cause more trouble than good! If that wasn't enough, four sacred beasts start pursuing Goro too, for reasons unknown. With unlucky fortune still plaguing him, and now both supernatural pets and beasts on his case, Goro's life will never be dull again! Can this much-maligned young man finally catch a break?",
