    "text": "Gokyoudai Monogatari is a heartwarming anime that follows the daily lives of a sister named Onei and her twin brother Junichiro. They live on their own in the working-class neighborhood of Dongurizaka, as their parents had to move overseas for work. Despite not having parental supervision, the positive community looks after the twins. Onei is an innocent young girl with a shiny, broad forehead that brings good luck to those who rub it. Her brother Junichiro is intelligent and often worries, while enjoying picture books and beetles. Together, they have charming adventures with the locals, including waitress Shizuka. Though Onei and Junichiro lead an unusual life without their parents, they seem content. Their neighbors constantly support them through friendly gestures and delightful surprises. The twins' uplifting story is filled with love and community spirit.",
