  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Onei and Junichiro Jinushi, a pair of kindergarten-aged twins, are the central characters in the anime adaptation of Tetsu Adachi's manga, Baka-Kyoudai, now titled Gokyoudai Monogatari. The siblings reside in the humble neighborhoods of Tokyo, leading carefree lives despite their parents' absence due to overseas work. Onei, an innocent girl with a radiant forehead, and Junichiro, a book-smart boy with a love for picture books and beetles, find joy and warmth in their daily encounters with their unique and friendly neighbors. The anime, set to premiere on TV Asahi on October 10, features Yuki Matsuoka as Onei, Yumiko Kobayashi as Junichiro, and Sayaka Ohara as Shizuka, a local waitress. The story, which has been running in Kodansha's Young Magazine since 1999 and received an award of excellence at the 7th Cultural Media Arts Festival in 2003, promises heartwarming surprises and a testament to the power of community.",
