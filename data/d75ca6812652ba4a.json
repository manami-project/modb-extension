As the comet swarm's onslaught has momentarily ceased, the girls have resumed their regular lives, balancing their time between rigorous training and part-time jobs at Shimojijima Base.\n\nHowever, their routine is disrupted by the arrival of two Comet Blasters, Chizuru Kubo and Annette Kerry, who present them with a startling video. Meanwhile, chaos brews at Orbital Station 7, which is grappling with severe complications.
