  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2314 AD, humanity enjoys a time of peace and prosperity thanks to the efforts of Celestial Being and their Gundam pilots, who were once viewed as villains but are now revered as heroes. However, this tranquility is threatened when a long lost Jupiter exploration ship mysteriously returns to Earth after 130 years, harboring an ominous alien threat known as the Extraterrestrial Living-metal Shape-shifters (ELS). Seeking to assimilate Earth's technology and people, the ELS pose a catastrophic danger to humanity's existence. As a result, Celestial Being and their Gundam Meisters, led by ace pilot Setsuna F. Seiei, spring back into action to confront this extraterrestrial menace. With Setsuna's own Innovator powers awakened, and the world's exposure to GN Particles having created more Innovators, the ultimate purpose of Aeolia Schenberg's plan will be put to the test against a foe not of this earth. To save humanity from obliteration, former rivals must unite with Celestial Being in a final mission more dire than ever before. The coming conflict may elucidate the true nature of the Innovator 'dialogues' Schenberg intended to prepare mankind for first contact with alien life.",
