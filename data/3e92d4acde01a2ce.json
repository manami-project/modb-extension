  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Meiji era's 11th year marked a turning point in Japan, with the ban on swords leading to the decline of the once-great samurai. Discontentment among the populace festered, leading to a surge in criminal activity. In response, the government constructed an impenetrable prison on Lake Biwa. The Kumo brothers - Tenka, Soramaru, and Chuutarou - were tasked with transporting criminals to this new facility. However, their journey was not as straightforward as it seemed, with unexpected adventures unfolding along the way. Meanwhile, an ancient curse known as 'Orochi' began to cast its ominous shadow over the city of Oumi, hinting at an impending catastrophe. As various factions scramble to find Orochi's human vessel, the Kumo brothers, along with a former Fuma ninja named Shirasu Kinjou, must navigate a complex web of intrigue and danger while fulfilling their duties.",
