  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In his childhood, Ryouta Murakami was friends with a girl named Kuroneko who claimed to know about the existence of aliens. One day, while attempting to show Ryouta proof of aliens, a tragic accident occurred resulting in Kuroneko's death and leaving Ryouta seriously injured. Years later, Ryouta is now a high school student and member of the astronomy club, still driven by a promise to prove Kuroneko right about aliens. When a mysterious transfer student named Neko Kuroha joins his class, Ryouta is shocked to see she bears an uncanny resemblance to his late friend Kuroneko. As Ryouta gets to know Neko more, he discovers she possesses strange supernatural abilities and a dark past - Neko is actually an escaped test subject from a secret government laboratory that was experimenting on artificially creating magic powers. Now on the run, Neko enlists Ryouta's help in evading her dangerous pursuers while also making him question everything he thought he knew about the universe. Thrust into a world of magic and intrigue, Ryouta finds the answer to his childhood promise to Kuroneko may be closer and more fantastical than he ever imagined. His quest to find proof of alien life leads him instead to hidden truths about the nature of reality itself.",
