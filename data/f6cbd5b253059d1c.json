  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the cusp of adolescence, 13-year-old Tomoya Mizuhara finds his life taking an unexpected turn when his father's remarriage introduces a new family member into his life: a 17-year-old stepsister named Ichika. As if navigating the complexities of teenage life wasn't challenging enough, Tomoya now has to grapple with Ichika's eccentric behavior and her intense, borderline alarming affection towards him. Adding to the mix are Ichika's friends, the sadistic Ruri and the quarter-Japanese, well-endowed Marina, making Tomoya's life anything but ordinary. This anime promises a rollercoaster ride of emotions, unexpected twists, and a unique exploration of familial bonds and adolescent relationships.",
