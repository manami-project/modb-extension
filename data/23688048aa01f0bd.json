    "text": "A mysterious yellow sphere traverses time and space, arriving in a modern metropolis. This anomalous orb proceeds to affect numerous denizens, spurring a series of unfolding events. Created in 2015 by Xinxin Liu while studying animation at Tokyo University of the Arts, this graduate project boasts directing by Liu herself, music by Shota Kowashi, sound design by Sachi Takahashi, and production support from renowned animator Koji Yamamura. Though brief in length, the cryptic storyline suggests dramatic developments likely stemming from the sphere's sudden and inexplicable manifestation. Its thought-provoking premise and aesthetic intrigue could potentially captivate viewers keen on avant-garde animation.",
