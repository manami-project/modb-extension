  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Since its inception, the prestigious Hyakkaou Private Academy has been a breeding ground for the world's most affluent and influential offspring. By day, the academy provides a top-tier education in traditional subjects, preparing students for their future roles in society. However, as night falls, the school reveals its true colors, transforming into a clandestine gambling haven where students learn the finer points of financial manipulation and power dynamics. In this world where wealth reigns supreme, the victors of high-stakes games ascend to the pinnacle of the school's hierarchy, while the vanquished suffer dire consequences.\n\nEnter Yumeko Jabami, an enigmatic and seemingly innocent transfer student with a penchant for the thrill of gambling. Unlike her classmates, who are driven by the desire for power and wealth, Yumeko's motivation lies solely in the exhilaration of taking risks and defying the odds. As she challenges the status quo and disrupts the delicate balance of power, the student body conspires to take her down. Little do they know, Yumeko's unconventional and borderline reckless approach to gambling may just be the wild card that changes the game forever.",
