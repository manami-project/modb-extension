    "text": "That's the story of \"Granbelm: The Two Princeps,\" an anime set in a world where magic vanished nearly a thousand years ago, leaving most people oblivious to its existence. Enter Mangetsu Kohinata, a cheerful and optimistic high school student who yearns for something she excels at, as she struggles in both academics and sports. One fateful full moon night, Mangetsu stumbles upon another girl named Shingetsu Ernesta Fukami, and together they encounter the mechanical dolls known as 'ARMANOX.'\n\nIn this world, magic was once prevalent until its destructive force in war led seven powerful mages to sacrifice their lives, sealing magic away. A thousand years later, the magic seal Magiaconatus holds Granbelm, a monthly battle to determine the one true mage, the Princeps. Mangetsu, mistaken for an enemy mage, is attacked but rescued by Shingetsu and her Armanox, Viola Katze. When Shingetsu is ambushed, Magiaconatus bestows upon Mangetsu the Armanox White Lily, enabling her to protect her new friend.\n\nOverwhelmed by the revelations, Mangetsu decides to help Shingetsu fight in Granbelm and fulfill her wish. As they navigate this new reality, Mangetsu discovers her hidden potential and embarks on a journey to master her magical abilities. Join Mangetsu and Shingetsu in their thrilling adventure, where the prize is nothing less than control over the lost magic that once governed the world.",
