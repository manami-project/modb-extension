  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Katsu Kaizou was once a promising child prodigy until a childhood accident left him eccentric and gullible. Now a high school student, he firmly believes he is a cyborg resurrected by his classmate Suzu after being struck by a falling model. Suzu and their friends play along with his delusions, leading to Kaizou joining the science club and getting embroiled in surreal misadventures. Whether facing off against sinister sushi chefs, ghosts, or his former classmates from genius school, Kaizou confronts the bizarre with endless optimism. Though his mental state is questionable, his heart is in the right place as he supports his friends in the science club. Together they find excitement, if not always logic, in the absurd situations Kaizou's active imagination drags them into. With conspiracies around every corner and aliens on the brain, Katsu Kaizou is an eccentric ball of energy ready to take on any challenge with his signature mix of gullibility and good cheer. His offbeat high school life overflows with oddballs and outrageous occurrences sure to raise both laughs and questions.",
