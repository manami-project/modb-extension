    "text": "Tsubouchi Chitan, Saien Suzu, and Natori Umi join Kaizou Katsu, a former child prodigy turned eccentric teenager, in a series of absurd and surreal adventures as part of their high school science club. After a childhood head injury caused by Umi, Kaizou's personality changed dramatically, leaving him with an intense fascination for all things occult, aliens, and ghosts. Following a mishap involving a falling anatomy model and a defibrillator, Kaizou becomes convinced that he is a cyborg, resurrected by the science club's president, Suzu. As they navigate through bizarre situations involving log people, deadly sushi, and robot invasions, Kaizou's past as a student of a school for geniuses comes back to haunt him. After a catastrophe at the academy, his former classmates, now eccentric themselves, seek revenge on Kaizou, leading to even more surreal encounters for the science club.",
