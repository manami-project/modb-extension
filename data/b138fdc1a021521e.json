    "text": "While the city of Ikebukuro basks in a semblance of tranquility following a chaotic six months, the unusual has become the new normal. The headless rider, Celty Sturluson, remains a constant target for both law enforcement and gang members, lured by a hefty bounty. Meanwhile, high school students, including Mikado Ryuugamine, revel in their youthful days, oblivious to the impending storm. A mysterious underclassman, Aoba Kuronuma, harbors hidden intentions and confronts Mikado with knowledge of his true identity. As a new menace, a masked murderer known as 'Hollywood,' emerges, the delicate peace begins to crumble. The intertwined lives of Ikebukuro's inhabitants, including Celty and her lover Shinra Kishitani, teeter on the brink of chaos, as an unseen puppet master orchestrates a sinister plot. With the balance in Ikebukuro at stake, the question remains: who will rise to maintain order amidst the looming chaos?",
