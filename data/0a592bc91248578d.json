    "text": "Anything can happen in the vibrant city of Neo San Francisco, where retro-future tech and monstrous attacks are the norm. Amidst this chaos, Muteki, a young newcomer from the countryside, finds himself in an unlikely partnership with a local DJ. When monsters threaten to disrupt the city's groove, the DJ's tunes transform Muteki into Muteking, a dancing hero who uses his rhythm and moves to save the day. As the two team up to take on the invaders, they soon realize that these attacks are just the beginning of a much greater danger. With the city's fate in their hands, Muteking and DJ must use their unique skills to save the day, one dance at a time. Get ready for a sci-fi hero love comedy that will have you singing and dancing along to the beat!",
