    "text": "The narrative of \"Charlotte\" unfolds around a select group of adolescents who develop extraordinary abilities during their teenage years. At the heart of the story is Yuu Otosaka, a seemingly ordinary high school student with a covert talent for mind control. Leveraging his power to manipulate others for five seconds at a time, Yuu leads a life of deception, acing exams and climbing the social ladder. However, his clandestine activities catch the attention of Nao Tomori, the formidable student council president of Hoshinoumi Academy. In a twist of fate, Nao coerces Yuu to transfer to her school and join the student council, a group secretly tasked with monitoring and protecting those with supernatural abilities. As Yuu reluctantly becomes a part of the council's mission, he uncovers a world far more complex and perilous than he could have ever imagined.",
