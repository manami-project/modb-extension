    "text": "Yagami Kazuma was originally part of the prestigious Kannagi family, renowned for their mastery of fire magic. However, Kazuma lacked any aptitude for fire magic, and after being defeated in a duel by his cousin Ayano, he was banished from the family in disgrace. Four years later, Kazuma returns to Japan as an extremely skilled wind magic user. His arrival coincides with a series of murders targeting the Kannagi family. Despite proclaiming his innocence, Kazuma comes under suspicion from Ayano and the rest of the Kannagis as the likely culprit. This ignites an intense feud between Kazuma and the family that exiled him. Now, Kazuma must clear his name and stop the real killer, while also confronting the painful memories from his past banishment. With the safety of the Kannagis and his own future at stake, Kazuma finds himself allied with Ayano against a dangerous enemy seeking to destroy the family. Their uneasy cooperation is complicated by the turbulent history between them. Can Kazuma overcome the prejudices against him and join forces with his former family to uncover the truth?",
