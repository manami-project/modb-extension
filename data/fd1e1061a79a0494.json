    "text": "While belonging to the prestigious Kannagi clan, a lineage renowned for their mastery over fire magic, Kazuma Yagami was an outcast due to his lack of fire-wielding abilities. After a humiliating defeat at the hands of his cousin Ayano, Kazura was banished from the family. Four years later, Kazuma returns as a formidable wind magic user, only to find himself accused of a series of murders within the Kannagi family. Despite his claims of innocence, the Kannagi family, including Ayano, suspects him of seeking vengeance. Amidst these accusations, Kazuma prepares for a fierce battle against his former family, determined to clear his name and uncover the real culprit. Based on the novel by Takahiro Yamato, this anime follows Kazuma's journey from an outcast to a powerful wind magic user, caught in a whirlwind of family feuds, suspicion, and survival.",
