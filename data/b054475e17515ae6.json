  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Uchiage Hanabi is the official music video for the ending theme song of the anime film \"Fireworks, Should We See it from the Side or the Bottom?\". It features the characters Nazuna and Norimichi, two teenagers who have feelings for each other but struggle to convey them. The song itself is a duet between musical artists DAOKO and Kenshi Yonezu. Its lyrics poetically describe a night of watching beautiful fireworks displays with a loved one. The accompanying video visually captures this sentiment through scenes of Nazuna and Norimichi surrounded by vibrant bursts of pyrotechnics, symbolic of the explosive emotions they have yet to confess to one another. As the ending theme to a coming-of-age anime romance, Uchiage Hanabi promises to be a sweeping, cathartic accompaniment. Its tender portrayal of young love amongst firework-lit skies aims to draw audiences into the hearts of the protagonists, inviting them to share in the longing and wonder of this luminous night.",
