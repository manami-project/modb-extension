  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wang Sheng, an ace sniper from the special forces, finds himself transported to the mystical Soul World. There, he is possessed by a weak, useless carp spirit, becoming an infamous outcast. In this world of powerful spirits and kung fu masters controlling the clouds, Wang Sheng is severely disadvantaged. However, using his military knowledge and indomitable will, he begins overcoming all obstacles. He defeats the giant wolf terrorizing the forest, and masters legendary techniques to empower his carp spirit. Legends say that a carp that leaps over the Dragon's Gate will transform into a dragon. Though initially viewed as trash, Wang Sheng gradually evolves his carp spirit into something greater. Through courage and perseverance, even a lowly carp can defy fate and become a soaring legend. Wang Sheng now strives to continue surmounting the sinister disputes plaguing the Soul World. Once looked down upon, he now seeks to leap over the Dragon's Gate and prove even the most unremarkable spirit can become exceptionally powerful.",
