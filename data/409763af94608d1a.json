    "text": "Special operative Wang Sheng finds himself transported to the mystical Soul World, a realm teeming with powerful spirits and formidable adversaries. Upon arrival, he is possessed by an unremarkable carp spirit, relegating him to the lowest rung of the spiritual hierarchy. In this cutthroat world, Wang Sheng must rely on his wits and knowledge to overcome challenges and evolve his seemingly worthless carp spirit into a formidable force. As the age-old adage goes, even a humble carp can ascend the Dragon Gate and transform into a mighty dragon. Embarking on a perilous journey, Wang Sheng must navigate treacherous disputes and forge his own path to greatness, proving that even the most insignificant beings can rise above their fate and become legends.",
