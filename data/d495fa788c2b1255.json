  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in 13th century Japan during the Mongol invasions, \"Angolmois: Record of Mongol Invasion\" chronicles a pivotal time when the age of the samurai emerged as warriors rose up to defend their land. The story follows Jinzaburo Kuchii, a Japanese exile sent to Tsushima Island where Mongol forces first make landfall in their campaign to conquer Japan. There, Jinzaburo joins a band of fighters led by Princess Teruhi. Together, they make a valiant last stand against the invading hordes. Outnumbered and outmatched, the fate of Tsushima and Japan hangs on the islandersâ€™ ability to withstand and repel the overwhelming might of the Mongol Empire. This anime portrays the tremendous odds faced by the defenders as well as explores the panic and struggles of wartime Japan. Yet it also shows how extraordinary courage and resilience can sometimes triumph, even in the face of a powerful enemy. As Jinzaburo, Princess Teruhi, and their allies fight to protect their homeland, they spark the rise of the samurai warrior culture that will have lasting influence through Japanese history. Angolmois captures this pivotal war and the awakening it inspired as medieval Japan shaped its identity in the flames of battle.",
