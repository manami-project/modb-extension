  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Later historians would identify Mongolia as the birthplace of the 'Great King of Terror', Angolmois, as the Mongolian Empire expanded rapidly across the globe in the 13th century. With Japan in their sights, the Mongols launched their first invasion in 1274, targeting Tsushima Island as the gateway to the mainland. Exiled samurai Jinzaburou Kuchii finds himself on the front lines of this epic battle, defending Japan against the formidable Mongol forces. Joined by Princess Teruhi, a lord's daughter, and other brave warriors, they must overcome overwhelming odds to protect their homeland and rise up against the invaders in this fresh take on the great battle that rocked medieval Japan. The age of the samurai has begun, and the fate of Tsushima hangs in the balance.",
