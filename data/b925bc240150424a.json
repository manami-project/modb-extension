    "text": "Misono and Tamaki welcome their new colleague, Sayuri Satou, at the Sparrow's Hotel, known for its close proximity to Heaven. While Sayuri boasts an infectious, cheerful personality and an impressive physique, her true talent lies in her exceptional assassination skills. She deftly handles any troublemakers that disrupt the tranquility of the business hotel. However, when it comes to conversing with the male hotel manager, Shiokawa, who happens to be Tamaki's older brother, Sayuri finds herself tongue-tied and fumbling for words. As the trio navigates through their daily tasks, from managing room rentals during Golden Week to preparing for unexpected inspections, Sayuri's unique abilities add an unexpected twist to the typical hotel experience. Join Sayuri, Misono, and Tamaki for a comedic and action-packed adventure at the Sparrow's Hotel!",
