    "text": "Maryuin Kouga, the hero of a fantasy world, was once the self-proclaimed identity of Ichirou Satou, a high school student who was tormented by his peers for his delusional behavior. After transferring schools, Ichirou vowed to abandon his imaginary persona and lead a normal life. However, fate has other plans when he crosses paths with Ryouko Satou, a girl who shares the same delusional tendencies. Clad in a blue cape, Ryouko believes herself to be an otherworldly researcher on a mission to find the elusive 'Dragon Terminal'.\n\nDespite his initial reluctance to engage with Ryouko, fearing a resurgence of his past, Ichirou finds himself inexplicably drawn to her. When he witnesses Ryouko falling prey to the same bullying he once endured, Ichirou's dormant heroic instincts are rekindled. Determined to save Ryouko from her delusions and the cruelty of their peers, Ichirou must confront his past and embrace the hero within. As the boundaries between reality and fantasy blur, Ichirou embarks on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and love in this captivating tale of adolescence and the power of imagination.",
