  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Brother Zenon Zebrowski dedicated his life to serving others as a Franciscan missionary in Japan. Arriving from Poland, he became known for his charitable work assisting victims of war, the wounded, and the poor. His selfless acts and willingness to sacrifice himself to help those in need made him a respected figure. Though the details of his early life remain vague, the impact he made through his compassion stands as his legacy. This biographical film encapsulates his story - one of a man who transcended borders and circumstances to live out the Franciscan call to love. His life in Japan and the relationships he built shine light on the power of the human spirit to uplift others.",
