  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tonbo and Kurogo Kurusu, two high school friends, embark on a mission to establish a Kabuki club at their school, driven by Kurogo's profound love for the traditional Japanese performing art. To bring their vision to life, they must recruit at least five members, but they soon discover that sparking interest in the centuries-old art form among their peers is no easy feat. Despite the challenges, Kurogo remains determined to share the enchanting world of Kabuki with a wider audience and inspire his fellow students to embrace this classic dance-drama as passionately as he does. Will they succeed in forming the club and eventually performing in front of an audience? Only time will tell.",
