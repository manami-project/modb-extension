    "text": "The Matsuno sextuplets are all set to host a takoyaki-cooking party at their residence in the animated film \"Osomatsu-san: Tamashii no Takoyaki Party to Densetsu no Otomari-kai.\" However, Totoko's suggestion of a sleepover sends the event spiraling into chaos. This exciting new animation project is one of two films announced at the 'Fes Matsu-san '21' event to celebrate the 6th anniversary of the beloved Osomatsu-san anime. The second film, slated for a limited theatrical release in Japan in 2023, promises to continue the sextuplets' wild adventures.",
