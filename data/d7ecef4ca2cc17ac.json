    "text": "The Dragon Cry is a powerful magic staff rumored to have the ability to destroy the world. It was being safely guarded in the Kingdom of Fiore until Zash, a traitor of Fiore, stole it and delivered it to Animus, the ruler of the neighboring Kingdom of Stella. Desperate to retrieve the dangerous staff, the Kingdom of Fiore recruits the Fairy Tail wizard guild - consisting of Natsu, Lucy, Happy, Gray, Erza, Wendy and Carla - for the mission. They infiltrate Stella and chase after Zash, soon discovering that Animus has sinister plans for the Dragon Cry. During their quest, they cross paths with Sonya, an aide to Animus hiding a secret agenda to save her country. What exactly does Animus intend to use the staff for? Why does Sonya want to protect Stella despite serving its ruthless king? The Fairy Tail wizards find themselves embroiled in the complex politics between the two kingdoms as they race to reclaim the Dragon Cry before Animus can unleash its apocalyptic power. Along the way, they must fight against dangerous foes while also contending with the awakening of Natsu's mysterious instinct.",
