    "text": "Tao Yuan Ming's centuries-old poem, \"The Legend of Shangri-La,\" serves as the inspiration for this visually captivating 3D CG short film. Crafted by IDMT, this animation masterfully integrates Chinese traditional painting techniques and papercutting with modern CG technology, creating a unique visual style reminiscent of Shan-Xi shadow puppet shows. The film takes viewers on a serene journey through Peach Blossom Valley, known to Western culture as Shangri-La, an earthly paradise deeply embedded in the minds of Dong Jin people. This tranquil depiction encapsulates their yearning for a harmonious and joyful existence. With numerous national and international awards under its belt, this film offers a captivating blend of cultural heritage and innovative storytelling, inviting audiences to immerse themselves in a timeless tale of tranquility and longing.",
