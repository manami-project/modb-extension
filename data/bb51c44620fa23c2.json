    "text": "The remnants of a once-thriving world are now inhabited by androids and robots, with two distinct beings, Poppy and Punkun, standing out among them. Poppy, an android with a strikingly human-like appearance, and Punkun, an android with no particular fascination for humans, form an unlikely duo. As they guard their territory against the formidable Dragonewts, they stumble upon hidden truths about their shattered world and the long-lost human race, thought to be extinct. One fateful night, a falling star graces the sky, setting the stage for an extraordinary journey based on FUZI's original work, 'The Missing 8', now brought to life as a captivating web animation.",
