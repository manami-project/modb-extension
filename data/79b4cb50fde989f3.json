  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hokkaidou Meron and Okinawa Awamo, under the orders of Ooedo Chanko, embark on a mission to eliminate Touhoku Zunko, a skilled archer who transforms ordinary mochi into delectable zunda mochi with her Zunda Arrow. Alongside her friends Touhoku Kiritan, Touhoku Itako, Chuugoku Usagi, Shikoku Metan, and Kyuushuu Sora, they relish the joy of indulging in zunda mochi. In stark contrast, Chanko spearheads the Natto Factory, accompanied by her allies Chuubu Tsurugi, Kansai Shinobi, and Awamo. Despite both zunda and natto utilizing the same type of bean, the edamame used in zunda is harvested earlier than the soybeans used in natto, sparking fear among the Natto Factory members of a potential soybean shortage. As the two factions collide, an unexpected third power emerges, further complicating the situation in this 2017 Anime Tamago Project.",
