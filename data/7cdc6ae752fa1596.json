    "text": "B-rank battles rage at the Border Defense Agency's headquarters, with each team vying for a coveted spot in the imminent Away Mission. In Mikado City, a gate to another world had previously opened, unleashing invaders known as Neighbors, who wreaked havoc and instilled fear. The Border Defense Agency emerged to research Neighbor technology and safeguard the world, constructing a vast base and a robust defensive system.\n\nFour years later, Osamu Mikumo and the Tamakoma-2 team aspire to rise to the top with the help of a gifted new recruit. As they advance through the ranks, they confront a myriad of obstacles and challenges. With the addition of Hyuse to the Tamakoma Squad, the rank wars persist, and the team works relentlessly to secure a position in the Away Missions.\n\nAs the final rounds approach, Osamu and his teammates must push beyond their current capabilities and devise innovative strategies. However, a contentious disagreement arises within the team, threatening to derail their chances of entering the Neighbor's dimension. Will they overcome their internal strife and emerge victorious in the B-rank wars, or will their aspirations crumble under the pressure?",
