    "text": "After surviving immense dangers in the layers above, Riko, Reg, and Nanachi continue their perilous journey into the depths of the enigmatic Abyss. Now equipped with Riko's newly acquired White Whistle, the group descends into the sixth layer - The Capital of the Unreturned. As they explore the unmapped domain filled with ruins of a once-promised Golden City, they encounter treacherous landscapes and dangerous creatures. Their expedition leads them to a village of strange hollow beings and unearthed mysteries left behind by forgotten adventurers. Though the way forward seems fraught with horror and uncertainty, Riko presses onward, driven by her desire to uncover the secrets of her mother Lyza's fateful last dive. Reg and Nanachi remain steadfast at her side, drawing on recovered memories and technologies to aid their survival. Together, the three friends venture deeper into the shadows of the Abyss's uncharted layers, risking humanity and life itself to discover what lies at the bottom of this terrifying and wondrous pit. Though the risks are great, so too are the wonders awaiting any bold enough to brave the Capital of the Unreturned.",
