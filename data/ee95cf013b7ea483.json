    "text": "Lieutenant Benio Hanamura, a modern woman of the early 20th century Japan, challenges societal norms and embraces innovation in a rapidly evolving world. Raised by her high-ranking military officer father, Benio defies traditional gender roles, engaging in activities like kendo, donning Western attire, and favoring literature over housework. She rejects the concept of arranged marriages, advocating for women's rights to choose their careers and partners.\n\nBenio's life takes a dramatic turn when her supportive fianc√©, Lieutenant Shinobu Ijuin, disappears and later returns with no recollection of his past. As Benio navigates through this complex situation, she faces the looming threat of an arranged marriage.\n\nIn this captivating sequel, Benio must find a way to rekindle her connection with Shinobu before she is forced into a new union. Joined by her friends Tamaki, a fellow advocate for women's rights, and Ranmaru, a young man with effeminate mannerisms due to his upbringing in kabuki theater, Benio embarks on a journey of self-discovery, love, and resilience. Will Benio succeed in her quest, or will societal expectations prevail?",
