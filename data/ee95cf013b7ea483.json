  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in early 20th century Japan, \"Haikara-san ga Tooru\" tells the story of Benio Hanamura, an independent-minded woman who goes against traditional gender roles of the time. Known as \"Haikara-san\" for her tomboyish nature, Benio studies kendo, drinks sake, rejects arranged marriage, and believes women have the right to work and marry for love - ideas seen as radical. She loses her mother at a young age and is raised by her father, a high-ranking army official. Her best friends are the feminine yet progressive Tamaki and Ranmaru, who was raised in kabuki theater to play female roles. Benio's betrothed is Shinobu Ijuuin, a lieutenant who supports her dreams, but he goes missing in action overseas. When Shinobu returns to Japan with amnesia, unable to recall his identity or relationship with Benio, her independence comes under threat as she faces being married off to another man. This sequel focuses on whether Benio can reconnect Shinobu with his memories before it's too late - testing her unconventional beliefs in a period of great social change.",
