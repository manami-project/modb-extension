  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unsatisfied with the ordinary, Takashi Natsume navigates the unseen realm of youkai, entities that remain invisible to the average eye. His unique gift, once thought of as a burden, now serves as a bridge between the spirit and human worlds, thanks to the 'Book of Friends' bequeathed to him by his late grandmother, Reiko. Accompanied by his self-appointed guardian, Nyanko-sensei, Natsume embarks on a mission to liberate the bound youkai by returning their names recorded in the book.\n\nAs Natsume interacts with a myriad of youkai and humans, he finds himself forming bonds he never imagined, challenging his initial belief that his ability was a curse. Despite facing constant pressure from the formidable exorcist clan Matoba, who desire his extraordinary gift, Natsume remains resolute in his approach to treat the youkai with kindness and respect, even when confronted with their dangerous and powerful members.\n\nNatsume's journey is not just about balancing the two worlds, but also about embracing his unique abilities and the friendships he forms along the way. As he learns to appreciate both his human and youkai companions, he realizes that happiness lies not in choosing one world over the other, but in cherishing the connections he has made in both.",
