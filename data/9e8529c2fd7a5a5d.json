    "text": "Son-Gohanâ€™s Haiya Dragon inspires a thrilling martial arts adventure in the 45-minute anime TV special, \"Kosukesama Rikimarusama: Konpeito no Ryu.\" Produced by J.C. Staff and aired on Japanese television in 1988, this story follows the young guardians of Konpei Island, Kosuke and Rikimaru. Their mission is to protect the last surviving dragon on Earth, Pochi, who possesses a precious gemstone on its forehead.\n\nThe peaceful life of the guardians and their dragon companion is disrupted when Sakurako, a professor from Tokyo, arrives to research Pochi. However, danger lurks as a ruthless collector, Yamada, and his formidable henchman, Michael Commando, descend upon the island to seize the gemstone.\n\nIn a battle reminiscent of the Red Ribbon Army from Dragon Ball, Kosuke and Rikimaru must rise to the challenge and defend not only Pochi but also the lives of all the residents on Konpei Island. With Toriyama-style mecha and high-stakes action, this anime special promises an engaging and suspenseful experience for viewers.",
