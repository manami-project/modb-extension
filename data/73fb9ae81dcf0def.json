  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryota Sato is an overworked salaryman who tragically dies from stress and exhaustion. However, he is given a second chance at life when he is reborn into a fantasy world resembling an RPG video game. There, he meets Emily Brown, a young female adventurer who helps explain the rules of this new world. Monsters roam dungeons and drop loot when defeated - including food, money, and rare items. Unfortunately, Ryota discovers that while his physical and magical abilities are at the absolute minimum level, he is unable to gain any experience points and is forever stuck at level 1. This seems like a death sentence, as nearly all inhabitants gain strength by leveling up. However, Ryota soon learns he has one special ability - an ultra rare skill called \"Drop Skill: All S\" which gives him the highest chance possible of getting uncommon and powerful drops from monsters. With his uniquely overpowered drop rate but pitiful stats, Ryota must learn to survive in this strange land alongside allies like Emily. Together they delve dungeons, defeat monsters, and collect rare loot, aiming to turn Ryota's singular talent into their advantage. It will be an adventure defined by life's extremes - both the weakest and strongest at the same time, Ryota strives to find his fortune and place in this bizarre yet exciting new world.",
