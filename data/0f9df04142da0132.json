    "text": "Seikyou Private Academy is known for its dark history of paranormal occurrences and myths. For 60 years, the school has been haunted by the ghost of Yuuko, a young woman who mysteriously died in the basement. With no memories of her life or death, Yuuko forms the Paranormal Investigations Club to uncover the truth. Yuuko meets freshman Teiichi Niiya, who can inexplicably see her. They quickly bond over their curiosity about Yuuko's past and the odd happenings around campus. Together with Teiichi's friend Kirie Kanoe, Yuuko's relative, and fellow club member Momoe Okonogi, they investigate the school's infamous Seven Mysteries, hoping to shed light on the circumstances of Yuuko's death. As the group delves deeper into the occult mysteries surrounding the academy, they inch ever closer to revealing the secrets of Yuuko's untimely demise 60 years prior. Will learning the tragic truth finally bring Yuuko peace? Or will disturbing the past only summon darker forces?",
