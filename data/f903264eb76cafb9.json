  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around Yuu Haruna, a shy high school student who has just transferred to a new school in Tokyo. Yuu is constantly checking his Twitter feed on his phone and struggles with social interactions. On his way to buy dinner, he suddenly crashes into Fuuka Akitsuki, a free-spirited girl who doesn't even own a cell phone. Fuuka is a mysterious yet charming girl who draws people to her. After accidentally breaking Yuu's phone, thinking he was taking inappropriate pictures, Fuuka later discovers they go to the same high school. There, they slowly become friends, along with Yuu's childhood friend Koyuki Hinashi, who is now a popular singer. The story follows the complex love triangle that develops between Yuu, the introverted Twitter-obsessed boy, Fuuka, the spirited and alluring girl without technology, and Koyuki, Yuu's famous singer friend from the past. It also traces Yuu and Fuuka's journey as they decide to start a band with their friends and enter the professional music world.",
