However, Eris, the malevolent Goddess of Chaos, has reawakened with a nefarious ambition to reign supreme and plunge the world into chaos. To achieve her sinister goal, Eris seizes the body of an innocent young girl and orchestrates a cunning scheme to weaken Athena using a mystical golden apple.\n\nAs Athena's life force ebbs away, a group of determined Bronze Saints, led by the courageous Seiya, embark on a perilous quest to rescue their beloved goddess. Before they can confront Eris, they must first overcome her formidable Ghost Knights, who stand as imposing obstacles in their path. Will Seiya and his friends triumph against these powerful adversaries and save Athena before it's too late? Join them in their thrilling and dangerous adventure to restore order and protect their world from the clutches of chaos.",
