    "text": "Girl after girl rejects Haru Tsuwabuki's confessions, leaving him with a grim fate if he can't find love among the 420 students at his academy. Branded a lowly 'parasitic biting insect' by his peers, his teenage years spiral into despair. Just when he thinks things can't get worse, he encounters Miyako Dokuutsugi, a stunning yet unlucky girl who drags him further into the depths of misery. This anime, based on Naruto Kiriyama's award-winning light novel 'Yonhyakunijuu Renpai Girl,' promises a dark and captivating tale of love, rejection, and the struggle for acceptance.",
