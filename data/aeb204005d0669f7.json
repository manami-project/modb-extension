  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two years after the legendary Build Divers team saved the EL-Diver in the Gunpla Battle Nexus Online (GBN) game, GBN has been upgraded with more realistic sensory feedback. In this exciting virtual world, several solitary Divers play for their own reasons: Hiroto is a wandering mercenary Diver; Kazami carefreely joins parties seeking someone he admires; May mysteriously plays Gunpla Battles constantly; and shy novice Parviz yearns to play co-op. Though alone, fate brings them together into a new Build Divers team for an experience beyond GBN. They must confront their weaknesses on a journey that transcends GBN itself.",
