As these gods fled their responsibilities, a new group of individuals known as Kashikans emerged, tasked with capturing the escaped gods and restoring balance to the world. Ichiyou, an unwilling Kashikan, embarks on this perilous journey to free his beloved tiger foster father, who was taken to serve as a replacement for the vanished gods. Alongside his companion Tenkou, Ichiyou harnesses the power of song and dance to recapture the gods and reclaim the tranquil life he once knew. Meanwhile, aspiring writer Nozomu stumbles upon Ichiyou and Tenkou's quest, witnessing firsthand the extraordinary bond between these two men and the enchanting world they inhabit.",
