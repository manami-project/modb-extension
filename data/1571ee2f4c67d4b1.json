  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Scientific Boys Club, a group of now 50-year-old men, decide to build a ship to sail to Mars on the so-called \"Ethereal Current,\" a theory proposed by the wife of one of the club members. She claims that the universe is flooded with ethereal energy that can propel space travel. Their goal is to travel to Mars and prove an old theory that there were once canals on Mars built by intelligent Martian life, though they do not expect to find any current life there. Many years after their journey, when both the Ethereal Current theory and the Martian canal theory have been disproven, a Mars expedition discovers a stone engraved with \"Scientific Boys Club 1954,\" providing lasting evidence of their pioneering voyage. Though considered nonsense in their time, the Scientific Boys Club ventured on an imaginative quest driven by curiosity, camaraderie and wonder.",
