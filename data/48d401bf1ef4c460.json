    "text": "After centuries of covert control over Japan, the ruthless ninja faction known as the Shinogara faces an unexpected rebellion from their most skilled assassin, Hayate Kanuma. In a daring act of defiance, Hayate assassinates his own father, the group's leader, and becomes a hunted man. In a desperate attempt to survive, Hayate transfers his soul into his sister Shiori's body, allowing her to summon his formidable ninja abilities in times of need. However, each invocation comes at a cost, as Shiori's true self gradually fades away. As the Shinogara close in, the stakes rise, and the siblings must find a way to end the group's tyranny before Shiori loses herself completely. This thrilling anime unfolds a tale of family, sacrifice, and redemption.",
