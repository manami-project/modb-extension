  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fuki is a spirited young girl who decides to set off on a journey to find a new home. Packing all of her essentials into a large backpack, she leaves the crowded city behind and ventures out into the countryside. As Fuki walks along an old, narrow path, she comes across a weathered statue of Jizo, a Buddhist deity known for protecting travelers. She places an apple as an offering and continues on her way. Before long, Fuki encounters a strange parade of creatures - including the river guardian Nurari-Hyotan and the fearsome shrine guardian Ushi-Oni. Undeterred by the creepy supernatural entities around her, brave Fuki presses forward with determination. Her quest is filled with mysterious encounters and fantastical beings at every turn. Where will her journey lead? What will she discover along the way? And will Fuki find the new home she seeks? This imaginative short film brings Ghibli magic to life through rich visual storytelling. Music and stunning animation convey a whimsical tale of adventure, courage and perseverance. Though dialogue is sparse, vibrant imagery and an emotive score speak volumes about the indomitable spirit of its endearing heroine.",
