With all her belongings packed into a large backpack, she leaves the bustling city behind and ventures into the countryside. Along the way, she encounters a variety of strange and mystical creatures, including a river guardian and a shrine guardian. As she navigates this magical world, Fuki must rely on her wits and courage to find her way. This short film, which is only screened at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, is a visual and musical feast that tells a heartwarming story without the need for spoken dialogue.",
