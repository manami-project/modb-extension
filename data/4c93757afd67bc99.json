Rei, armed with her knowledge of the game, decides to pursue Claire instead of the male leads presented in the game. However, Rei's romantic advances towards Claire may not go as planned, as the villainess is used to being feared by everyone. Will Rei's determination and love for Claire be enough to win her over, or will the game's logic and male leads stand in their way? Tune in to find out!",
