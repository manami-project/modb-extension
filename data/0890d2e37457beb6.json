  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Before he ever crossed paths with Rea, Chihiro embarks on a journey to Tohoku with his father and friends to help sort through a massive collection of books belonging to his uncle. The trip stirs up haunting memories of his mother's tragic death, a topic his father avoids discussing. Amidst the piles of books, Chihiro stumbles upon a cryptic tome about resurrecting the dead, accompanied by an old photograph of his mother. Meanwhile, Rea endures mistreatment from her stepmother, Aria, who drowns her sorrows in alcohol due to her husband's fixation on Rea. In an unexpected turn of events, Chihiro and his family discover a peculiar girl hiding beneath their temple, who seems reluctant to communicate with anyone. As the story unfolds, Rea is pushed down the stairs by this mysterious girl, and the Furuya family finds their hydrangea leaves inexplicably torn apart. These events are part of a two-episode OVA, with the first episode serving as a prequel penned by the manga's author, revealing that Chihiro and Rea have already met at an outdoor hot spring bath. The second episode takes place after the main series, introducing the enigmatic girl lurking under the Furuya household temple.",
