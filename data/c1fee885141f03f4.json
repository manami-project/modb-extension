    "text": "Apple Anime Fest in 2003 and released widely in South Korea in 2004, \"Hammerboy\" is set in a post-apocalyptic 2112 AD. After a devastating global disaster, the world is left with scattered civilizations clinging to the remnants of a once-industrialized Earth. On the isolated Candlestick Island, a small community thrives amidst the ruins of a colossal skyscraper.\n\nAt the heart of this community is Mangchi, a spirited pre-adolescent boy yearning for adventure beyond his mundane life. Armed with his enchanted hammer, Mangchi fearlessly explores the island, overcoming obstacles with the might of his magical tool. His life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters Princess Poplar, a fugitive royal from the kingdom of Jemius.\n\nPursued by the power-hungry traitor Moonk and his henchmen, Poplar seeks refuge on Candlestick Island. Mangchi, now dubbed 'Hammerboy,' finds himself entangled in a perilous journey to help Poplar escape her enemies and return to her homeland. With his latent powers awakening, Hammerboy must navigate this adventure of a lifetime, risking everything to save humanity and the newfound friend he's come to cherish.",
