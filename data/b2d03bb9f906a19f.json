Led by the indomitable Amanda Waller, head of A.R.G.U.S., this infamous team of misfits - including Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Peacemaker, Clayface, and King Shark - finds themselves in a world teeming with magic, swords, and dragons.\n\nWith a lethal nano-bomb implanted in their necks, escape is nothing more than a distant dream, and failure means certain death.
