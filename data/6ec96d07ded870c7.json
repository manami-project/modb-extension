    "text": "Yuuji Kazami, a student at Mihama Academy, finds himself detained by Ichigaya on suspicion of terrorism. However, Ichigaya actually has ulterior motives for holding Yuuji. Meanwhile, Mihama Academy is set to close due to financial troubles. Over the past year though, Yuuji has helped the five female students at the academy - Amane, Makina, Sachi, Yumiko and Michiru - grow into strong, independent young women. Now, with their beloved school closing and their mentor Yuuji imprisoned, the five girls band together in a desperate bid to uncover the truth and fight back against powerful forces seeking to use Yuuji for political gain. With help from a mysterious ally named Thanatos, the Mihama girls plunge headfirst into a dangerous game of international intrigue. As they fight to free Yuuji, they uncover secrets about his mysterious past, including his traumatic childhood and his connections to both the terrorist Heath Oslo and an advanced artificial intelligence system called CIRS. In the end, the strength of the bonds between Yuuji and the five heroines is put to the ultimate test.",
