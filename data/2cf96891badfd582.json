  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Natsunosuke Bonda is a 26-year-old left-handed relief pitcher playing his 8th season with the professional baseball team, the Jingu Spiders. In this highly competitive environment where players' salaries are directly tied to their on-field performance, Natsunosuke earns 18 million yen per year - putting him in the middle of the pack. As one of the few players without a guaranteed long career, Natsunosuke constantly stresses about maintaining his performance level and income stream before his playing days end. His mantra is \"there's money buried in the grounds,\" reflecting both the financial pressures players face as well as his determination to keep excelling. Through the ups and downs of games and contract negotiations, Natsunosuke fights to secure his place on the team and provide for his future. The 'baseball money survival' story follows his efforts to survive and thrive in this stratified system where income defines so much.",
