  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Asta and Yuno are two young boys who grew up together in a church orphanage in the Clover Kingdom. Despite their challenging upbringing, they share an unbreakable bond and dream of becoming the Wizard King - the strongest mage in the kingdom. However, their paths begin to diverge as they come of age. While Yuno is gifted with immense magical power, Asta struggles as he is unable to use magic at all. Yet Asta perseveres through physical training, still determined to realize his dream alongside his dear friend. When both boys turn 15, Yuno receives a legendary four-leaf wind grimoire, indicating his world-class magical talents. Asta receives nothing, but later manifests the ultra-rare five-leaf anti-magic grimoire in a moment of intense emotion. Now armed with mysterious anti-magic, Asta gains the power to cancel out all magical effects. Though starting from vastly different origins, the two friends now begin a friendly rivalry on their parallel journeys to become the Wizard King. They join separate Magic Knight squads, ready to hone their unique abilities and prove themselves against all odds.",
