    "text": "Though abandoned as infants at the same church and raised together, Asta and Yuno's lives diverge as they grow older in a world where magic is the norm. While Yuno emerges as a prodigy with an extraordinary four-leaf clover grimoire, Asta, devoid of magical abilities, hones his physical prowess. Despite their differences, they share a mutual goal: to become the next Wizard King. When a menacing thief targets Yuno's grimoire, Asta's inner strength awakens, revealing his rare five-leaf clover 'Black Clover' grimoire, capable of nullifying magic. As they embark on their journey to become Magic Knights, their friendly rivalry intensifies, leading them towards a future filled with adventures, challenges, and the pursuit of the ultimate magical crown.",
