  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Hotaru Ichijo moves from bustling Tokyo to a tiny rural village, she experiences major culture shock. Her new school, Asahigaoka Branch School, only has three other students - first grader Renge and seventh and eighth graders Natsumi and Komari Koshigaya. The laidback countryside lifestyle is vastly different from Hotaru's city upbringing. The nearest comic book store is a 20 minute bike ride away and the video rental shop is ten train stations down the line. Despite the isolation and lack of amenities, Hotaru quickly adjusts to country living. She enjoys spending time with the eccentric Renge and the cheerful Koshigaya sisters. Even Suguru, the sole male student at the school, is easy for Hotaru to befriend. Although life moves at a slower pace in Asahigaoka, Hotaru looks forward to new adventures, like mountain herb harvesting and fishing trips, with her quirky new friends. She comes to realize that home is where the heart is - not where the bustling city or latest conveniences may be. Hotaru settles into the cozy comfort of country living and an unbreakable bond with her four fellow classmates in this tiny rural school.",
