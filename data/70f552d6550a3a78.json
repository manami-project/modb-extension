  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a hidden forest castle, Princess Elisa and her six brothers lead an idyllic life, until their father, the king, loses his way in the woods and is coerced by a witch to marry her beautiful daughter. The new queen, driven by jealousy, casts a spell that transforms the six princes into swans, leaving Elisa untouched. Determined to break the curse and restore her brothers' human forms, Elisa embarks on a perilous journey to find them. Drawing inspiration from Hans Christian Andersen's \"The Wild Swans\" and the Grimm Brothers' \"The Six Swans,\" this Japanese adaptation offers a fresh take on the classic tale, with complex characters, captivating action, and not a single song.",
