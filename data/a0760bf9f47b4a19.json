    "text": "Vanilla and Chocola, two catgirls, secretly follow their master, Kashou Minaduki, as he sets out to establish his own patisserie, La Soleil. Kashou, hailing from a distinguished lineage of Japanese confectionery makers, discovers the duo hidden in cardboard boxes and initially attempts to send them back. However, their persistent pleas eventually soften his heart, and he allows them to stay. Together, they run La Soleil, assisted by Kashou's sister, Shigure, and other catgirls from their family: Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon, and Coconut. One fateful day, Chocola encounters a lone kitten during her errands, sparking a new chapter in their delightful journey. As the Minazuki household embraces the newest addition, Cacao, their lives become more vibrant and lively than ever before. Based on the visual novel series by Neko Works, this heartwarming tale unfolds in a world where catgirls are not uncommon, living alongside humans and contributing to their daily lives.",
