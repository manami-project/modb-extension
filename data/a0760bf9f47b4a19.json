    "text": "Kashou Minaduki moves away from his family's long line of Japanese confectioners to open his own patisserie, La Soleil. While unpacking, he discovers two catgirls, Chocola and Vanilla, who had stowed away. Though initially trying to return them, Kashou relents when they plead to stay and help run the shop. They soon build a happy life with Kashou's sister Shigure and other catgirls Azuki, Maple, Cinnamon, and Coconut. One day while running errands, Chocola meets an abandoned kitten catgirl in the park. She gives the kitten chocolate and returns home, only to have the kitten follow her back. This chance encounter brings an new friend into the Minaduki family's lively home.",
