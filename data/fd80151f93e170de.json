This lively quartet, consisting of a spirited werewolf named Liru, an enchanting vampire named Pachira, a nurturing android named Aiko, and an eager witch-in-training named Uma, hail from the magical realm and have ventured to the human world in search of a new place to call home. However, their unfamiliarity with human customs and everyday life leads to a series of comedic misadventures.\n\nAs they navigate the complexities of living among humans, the girls encounter challenges such as coping with sunlight, mastering magic, managing their android strength, and controlling their insatiable hunger for food. Despite these obstacles, they remain undeterred and find joy in exploring human experiences, from participating in cultural festivals to navigating the postal system.\n\nBut their presence in the human world has not gone unnoticed. Dr. K-Ko, a scientist determined to prove the existence of the supernatural, becomes fixated on capturing the girls to advance her own career.
