    "text": "At the pinnacle of the idol music world, the renowned group \"Fool's End\" shocks fans and competitors alike by disbanding, leaving behind the coveted title of \"Tenka Bata\" — a symbol reserved only for the world's greatest idols. To determine the next holder of this prestigious title, a nationwide \"Battle Royale for the Tenka Bata\" is announced, with three idol units vying for the top spot.\n\nLed by reincarnated Sengoku-era commanders turned music producers, these idol groups — NO PRINCESS, Lunatic Eyes, and X-UC — must prove their worth through music sales, live performances, and merchandise sales. The victor will not only claim the title of \"Tenka Bata\" but also perform a grand live concert as 'the greatest under the heavens.'\n\nAs the first battle commences at the Kawanakajima Festival, the youngest member of X-UC, Risa Umino, succumbs to the immense pressure and disappears before the performance. With only nine members remaining, X-UC must rise to the challenge and deliver an unforgettable performance. Will they triumph against adversity and etch their name in music history? The thrilling battle for idol supremacy unfolds in this electrifying anime.",
