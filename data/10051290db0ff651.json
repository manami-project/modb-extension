  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, find themselves separated across parallel worlds after Edward defies the laws of alchemy in an attempt to save his brother. In 1923 Munich, Germany, Edward, now powerless and stranded in a world dominated by science, is working alongside Alphonse Heiderich, a young man who bears a striking resemblance to his lost brother, to research rocketry in hopes of finding a way back home. Despite the challenges of adapting to a post-World War I society, Edward remains determined to reunite with Alphonse, even if it means delving into the dangerous secrets of the Thule organization, a secret occultist group connected to the Nazi party, who are rumored to have found a mythical place called Shambala. Meanwhile, in their original world, Alphonse, driven by the desire to reunite with his brother, is on a quest to master alchemy and uncover the mysteries that could lead him to Edward. However, the question remains whether their pursuits will lead to the reunion they desire or result in unforeseen chaos.",
