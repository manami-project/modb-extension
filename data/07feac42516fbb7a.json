  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Iori and K' clash amidst a city ablaze, as the once peaceful southern metropolis is plunged back into chaos. After Alba Meira, a skilled martial artist, defeated Duke and dismantled the criminal organization Mephistopheles, the city had finally experienced a period of tranquility. However, with Alba's temporary departure, his brother Soiree is left in charge, and fighting once again breaks out.\n\nAs fires spread throughout South Town, Soiree struggles to protect the citizens and uphold his brother's legacy. Despite his efforts, not everyone is willing to cooperate, and Soiree finds himself called out for a fight. Elsewhere in the city, an assassin targets an unknown individual, and another is wrongly accused of starting the blaze.\n\nThe four episodes unfold in Southtown, a city well-known to fans of the KOF series as the stage for numerous death matches. Many past heroes of the saga make an appearance, as the intertwining plots create a large-scale drama linked to the story of KOF Maximum Impact 2. With no end in sight for the violence, the future of South Town hangs in the balance.",
