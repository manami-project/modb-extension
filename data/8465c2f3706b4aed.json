    "text": "Himeno Toyokawa, having lost her mother at a tender age, finds herself relocating to Tajimi, a city nestled in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Tajimi, renowned for its Mino earthenware, is not only the birthplace of her late mother, a legendary potter, but also the location of her mother's alma mater, which Himeno now attends. On her first day, she brings her mother's ceramic works to school, catching the eye of the vivacious Mika Kukuri. Mika, recognizing the pottery, introduces Himeno to the president of the school's pottery club, Touko Aoki. Although hesitant initially, Himeno's interest in pottery is sparked, leading her to join the club alongside Mika and her childhood friend, Naoko Naruse. Despite being a novice, Himeno's resilience shines as she pursues her newfound passion, aspiring to honor her mother's legacy in the world of ceramics. As she delves deeper into the art, she uncovers the rich history and culture of Tajimi, forging new friendships and connections along the way.",
