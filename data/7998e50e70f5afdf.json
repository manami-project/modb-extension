  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime \"Enter The Garden\" is a three-part anthology series created through a collaboration between Azuki and Dentsu, with acclaimed director Goro Taniguchi serving as creative producer. Taniguchi is known for hit series like \"Code Geass\" and the recent \"One Piece Film Red.\" The first episode, \"The Waiting Man,\" follows Haru, a free-spirited young skater who has always felt like an outsider struggling to conform. One day Haru encounters T.K., a mysterious man perpetually waiting by a vending machine for an unknown person to appear. Their meeting sparks a chain of events that leads Haru to question assumptions about her own identity and place in the world. While details on the subsequent episodes remain unclear, the anthology format promises a diversity of stories tied together by themes related to Azuki, an NFT project brought to the screen by its parent company Chiru Labs and production powerhouse Dentsu. Taniguchi's involvement adds pedigree and the likelihood of imaginative animation that pushes creative boundaries. Overall, \"Enter The Garden\" shapes up as an ambitious anime production blending cutting-edge IP, technical wizardry, and reflective storytelling. The first episode offers both youthful exuberance and philosophical rumination, paving the way for an anthology that should challenge and delight viewers when it launches over 2023.",
