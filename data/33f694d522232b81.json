Despite their contrasting personalities, they captivate audiences with their electrifying performances, aiming to reach the top of the idol world.\n\nHowever, as IDOLiSH7's success grows, so do the challenges they face. When TRIGGER, a fellow idol group, becomes embroiled in a damaging scandal, IDOLiSH7 and Re:Vale join forces to help their struggling comrades. But time is of the essence, and one wrong move could lead to a similar fate for either group.\n\nMeanwhile, the emerging idol group ŹOOĻ, managed by the ruthless Ryou Tsukumo, capitalizes on TRIGGER's downfall, using underhanded tactics to rise to the top. As IDOLiSH7 and Re:Vale work to salvage TRIGGER's reputation, they must also navigate the mysterious influence of the legendary idol Zero, who disappeared 15 years ago but whose presence still lingers in the industry.\n\nWith the odds stacked against them, IDOLiSH7 and Re:Vale must navigate the cutthroat world of idol stardom, where success and scandal go hand in hand. Can they emerge unscathed and protect their fellow idols, or will they fall victim to the ruthless machinations of their rivals?",
