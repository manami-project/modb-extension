  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set during World War II on the island of Peleliu, this anime follows a group of Japanese soldiers taking part in the Battle of Peleliu, a brutal months-long campaign against American forces. The story is told through the perspective of Tamaru, a 22-year-old aspiring manga artist who dreams of returning home after the war to pursue his artistic passions. Though Tamaru sees the island's natural beauty and views their base as a potential setting for his manga stories, his comrades are resigned to the grim likelihood that they will die on Peleliu and never make it home. As the battle rages on, claiming heavy casualties on both sides, Tamaru grapples internally with the harsh realities of war while still clinging to hope for the future. Based on a manga, this anime provides an intimate look at the lives and mindsets of Japanese soldiers during a pivotal WWII campaign, highlighting the universal human experiences of youth, camaraderie, fear, and dreams that persist even amidst the devastating violence of war.",
