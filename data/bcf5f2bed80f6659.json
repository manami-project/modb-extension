    "text": "Primordial Times, a period marked by ruthlessness and conflict, becomes the new reality for Li Changshou after he is reborn into an era preceding the epic Fengshen War. As a humble cultivator, Li Changshou's primary objective is to navigate this treacherous landscape unscathed and attain immortality.\n\nMeticulously avoiding any entanglements that could lead to harm, Li Changshou treads carefully, always thinking several steps ahead. His arsenal includes a variety of escape techniques, mastery over mystical abilities, and a knack for refining poisonous pills. His strategy is simple yet effective - maintain a low profile, conceal his true abilities, and diligently cultivate his powers in the solitude of the mountains.\n\nHowever, his well-laid plans take an unexpected turn when his master introduces a young girl as a new apprentice. This unforeseen addition to his quiet life disrupts his original plan, leading him down a path filled with new challenges and experiences. Despite the changes, Li Changshou remains steadfast, silently overcoming adversaries while forging alliances with those who share his values. His journey towards immortality transforms into a quest for understanding life's true meaning.",
