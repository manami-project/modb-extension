  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the 22nd century, humanity has abandoned the now-uninhabitable Earth and lives in space colonies. Luna, an orphaned girl, earns a scholarship to attend the prestigious Soria Academy. On a school field trip to observe an alien planet being colonized, a gravitational storm strikes their spaceship. Luna's escape pod gets separated and crashes onto the unexplored alien planet along with a handful of her classmates. Stranded on this dangerous planet, Luna finds herself the de facto leader of her classmates - a motley crew of different personalities. With no experience surviving wilderness, little supplies, and strange alien creatures lurking in the shadows, the group faces a desperate daily struggle to stay alive. They cling to the hope that a rescue party will find them, if they can just survive long enough alone on this alien world. It's a battle for their lives where they'll have to work together and draw on strengths they never knew they had.",
