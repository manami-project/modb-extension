    "text": "In the year 20XX, mysterious giant robots called \"Giant Robos\" (GRs) suddenly appear around the world, destroying cities and spreading fear. An 18-year-old school dropout named Daisaku Kusama is working at a diving shop in southern Japan when he has a strange vision while diving. That night on the beach, Daisaku meets a mysterious girl named V who tells him he is destined to make a contract with one of the Giant Robos. Daisaku goes diving again and discovers an underwater pyramid. Inside, he establishes a psychic bond with Giant Robo 1. He joins the organization UNISOM, Earth's defense force against the GRs, becoming Giant Robo 1's pilot. However, the antagonist organization GRO has also gained control of some Giant Robos. A battle erupts between UNISOM and GRO for control of the powerful robots. As Daisaku fights against GRO's \"armored terrorism,\" questions remain about V's connection to the Giant Robos as well as the true purpose behind their sudden destructive appearance. Daisaku senses that the Giant Robos hold some deeper significance tied to the ancient pyramid ruins. His epic struggle may reveal the true meaning of the Giant Robos' power.",
