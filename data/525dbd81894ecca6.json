  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kusakabe Sakura is an ordinary middle school student whose life is turned upside down when an angel named Dokuro suddenly moves into his house. Dokuro belongs to an order of angels assigned to assassinate Sakura in the future for inadvertently creating immortality and causing social chaos. However, believing Sakura can be redeemed, Dokuro resolves to protect him instead. What ensues are a series of bizarre, hilarious, and violent misadventures involving Sakura, Dokuro, and other angels like Dokuro's younger sister Zakuro and the seductive Sabato. Dokuro frequently ends up beating Sakura to death with her spiked bat \"Excalibolg\" only to revive him later, while Sabato tries to carry out Sakura's original assassination. Sakura's normal life crumbles as these angels disrupt his everyday activities, like school trips and even bath time, with their crazy antics. Yet through it all, Dokuro remains determined to prevent Sakura's foretold dark fate - even if it means repeatedly killing him in over-the-top ways.",
