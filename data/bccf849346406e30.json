    "text": "This is an uplifting story about a boy and his snowman friend named Norman, who embark on a wintry journey together to see a meteor shower lighting up the night sky. When they learn the long-awaited shooting stars will soon be visible over their small town, the boy and Norman decide to venture out into the cold and snow to witness the magical sight. Despite their enthusiasm, the pair face disappointment when they realize the skies have become too overcast to view any stars that night. Yet even without seeing the meteors, the boy and his snowman companion still share special moments together as they travel through snow-covered lands. Their story is a simple yet heartwarming tale reminding us that the greatest joys can come from the smallest adventures spent with true friends.",
