    "text": "While World War II ravages Tokyo, Toshiko Ei and her family grapple with the harsh realities of war. Her father, a renowned glass artisan, provides a comfortable life for the family, but as Japan's defeat looms, scarcity of food and resources takes a toll on the populace. Tragedy strikes on March 10th, 1945, when a bombing raid claims the lives of Toshiko's mother and two younger sisters. In the aftermath, she discovers a fire-deformed glass rabbit, a chilling testament to the war's destruction. As the family attempts to evacuate to the suburbs, Toshiko's father is killed by the U.S. Army en route to the train station. Left alone, Toshiko is consumed by despair and loneliness, but she finds a reason to endure: to honor her family's memory by visiting their grave. This poignant tale serves as a stark reminder of the resilience of the human spirit amidst the devastation of war.",
