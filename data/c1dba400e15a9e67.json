    "text": "Aikawa Maki, a once celebrated gymnast, has traded the balance beam for the gritty world of street fighting. Now, she's known as 'Airmaster,' a moniker earned through her unique fighting style that combines her gymnastic prowess with an airborne combat technique. At just 16, this high school student transforms from an ordinary girl into an invincible fighter when she steps onto the streets. Standing tall at seven feet, she appears to soar through the air, seeking the thrill and tension that only violence can provide. As she revives the legend of 'airborne street fighting,' Maki is on a relentless quest to find the strongest opponents, hoping to rekindle the exhilaration she once felt as a gymnast. Will she find them, or will they find her first in this high-stakes, aerial combat arena?",
