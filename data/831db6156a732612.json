  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Their tranquil existence in the picturesque Moominvalley is disrupted when the Moomins and their friends, Sniff and Mii, embark on a daring journey to the Observatory atop the Lonely Mountains. The usually cheerful Moomin, his curious friend Sniff, and the lively Little My are compelled to seek answers from the scientists after the pessimistic Muskrat predicts an impending catastrophe, and dark clouds loom overhead, releasing black dust and acid rain.\n\nAs the trio traverses through various adventures, they encounter new friends like Snufkin, the Hemulen, and the Snorks, who join them in their quest for the truth. The dreadful revelation awaits them at the observatory - a comet is hurtling towards Earth, threatening to annihilate their beloved Moominvalley.\n\nWith time running out, the brave Moomin family and their friends decide to leave their idyllic home in search of shelter. Together, they face danger and make exciting discoveries, ultimately finding solace in an unoccupied cave. As they wait with bated breath for the comet's arrival, the Moomins and their companions display unwavering courage and determination, hoping for the best in the face of impending doom.",
