    "text": "Upon discovering Charlotte Evans, a disgraced noblewoman unjustly accused of heinous crimes, the reclusive sorcerer Allen Crawford, infamously known as the \"Dark Lord,\" is reminded of his own bitter betrayal. Despite his misanthropic tendencies, Allen takes pity on Charlotte and offers her refuge in his forest mansion. As they bond over their shared experiences of betrayal, Allen vows to introduce Charlotte to the pleasures and indulgences of a life free from societal constraints. As the once-naive noblewoman embraces her newfound freedom, Allen finds himself inexplicably drawn to her sweet innocence, leading to an unexpected connection between two broken souls seeking solace in each other's company.",
