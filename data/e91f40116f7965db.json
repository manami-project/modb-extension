    "text": "Deep in the forest lives Allen, a powerful yet cynical sorcerer known as the \"Dark Lord\" who was betrayed by his former adventuring companions years ago. He finds an unconscious young woman named Charlotte, a disgraced noblewoman exiled from her country on false charges. Recognizing the injustice Charlotte has faced, Allen takes her in as his housemaid. He aims to teach her to embrace life's pleasures and follow her heart's desires, things she was denied as an illegitimate noble daughter living in her sister's shadow. Though initially hesitant, the sweetly innocent Charlotte slowly opens herself up to experiencing Allen's riotous world. As they spend more time together, Allen and Charlotte discover striking parallels in one another's lonely pasts. An unlikely bond forms between the jaded sorcerer and the kindhearted exile as Allen helps Charlotte break free from her gilded cage. Though the world may have forsaken them, they have found solace in each other's company. Will their deepening relationship heal their wounded hearts and blossom into something more?",
