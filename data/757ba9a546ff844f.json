  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After winning a decisive battle against the United Mankind fleet, the Abh Star Force begins Operation Hunter to seek out and destroy the remaining enemy forces. Meanwhile, Princess Lafiel and Jinto are assigned as ambassadors to establish imperial rule on the newly conquered planet Lobnas. Upon arriving, they discover Lobnas is actually a remote prison planet holding millions of dangerous convicts from across the galaxy. The prisoners live in horrific conditions and are segregated into sectors by gender and sterilization status. Tensions boil over as the women prisoners request emigration off Lobnas, spurring an uprising by the men who take Jinto hostage in protest. With convicts rebelling planetwide and an enemy fleet suddenly appearing in the system, Lafiel faces an impossible choice between saving Jinto or abandoning him to lead the space battle. Caught in the middle of a planetary war zone and incoming enemy attack, Lafiel and Jinto face their greatest challenge yet on what was thought to be a routine diplomatic mission. The very fate of Lobnas and its inmates hangs in the balance.",
