    "text": "The graduate students of Saitama University, Shinya Yukimura and Ayame Himuro, find themselves in a peculiar predicament after returning from their Okinawa trip. Despite their mutual feelings, they struggle to scientifically validate their love for each other. Unable to recreate the conditions that led to their first kiss, they turn to the Institute of Biology for help. Collaborating with Chris Florette and Suiu Fujiwara, a couple who excels in their romantic metrics, Yukimura and Himuro embark on a quest to quantify their affection. However, their findings reveal that their love pales in comparison to the mature relationship of Chris and Suiu. Determined to prove the authenticity of their feelings, Yukimura and Himuro delve deeper into their research, hoping to discover a scientific basis for their love. Will their pursuit of empirical evidence lead them to the irrefutable proof they seek, or will it challenge the very nature of their affection? Join them on their journey as they strive to find the answer to this intriguing question: can love truly be proven by science?",
