  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shinya Yukimura and Ayame Himuro are graduate students and lab partners at Saitama University who develop feelings for one another during a research trip. Upon returning, they seek to scientifically prove that what they feel is love. However, unable to replicate the exact conditions that led to their first kiss, they turn to their fellow graduate students Chris Florette and Suiu Fujiwara for help. As an established couple, Chris and Suiu agree to participate in comparative experiments measuring biochemical and physiological responses to romance. Much to Ayame and Shinya's dismay, the results show that Chris and Suiu's bond vastly exceeds their own fledgling relationship. Thrown into doubt, Ayame and Shinya must now contemplate if science can validate love or if they must find purpose through other means. Ultimately, Shinya decides to pursue Ayame regardless, willing to put everything on the line to legitimize their emotions. Through perseverance and partnership, the two scientists continue their unconventional romance.",
