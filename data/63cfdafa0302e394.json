    "text": "Sentai Filmworks presents \"Wasteful Days of High School Girls,\" a delightful anime adaptation of Bino's manga, where the absurd antics of a high school trio take center stage. The self-proclaimed mastermind, Nozomu Tanaka, finds herself in an all-girls school, a less-than-ideal scenario for her high school dream of finding a boyfriend. In an attempt to spice up their monotonous days, Tanaka assigns her friends nicknames based on their peculiar traits, only to find herself christened as \"Baka\" in retaliation.\n\nAkane \"Ota\" Kikuchi, the otaku of the group, harbors dreams of becoming a manga artist, while Shiori \"Robo\" Saginomiya, with her expressionless demeanor, completes the eccentric trio. As they navigate through the chaotic and comical world of high school, these girls engage in endless banter and ridiculous escapades, making their youth anything but ordinary. With a diverse cast of quirky characters, each day begins with a simple question: \"Hey, wanna hear something amazing?\" and thus unfolds another episode of their amusing high school journey.",
