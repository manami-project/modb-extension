    "text": "Egashira, Kaido's assistant director, has made it impossible for Gorou to join any high school with an established baseball team. With his dreams of becoming a professional baseball player like his father, Gorou finds himself at Seishuu High, a former all-girls school with only 38 boys and no baseball team. Despite the odds, Gorou is determined to create a team from scratch and lead them to the prestigious Koshien tournament. But first, he must convince the few boys at Seishuu to join him and transform them from amateurs to competitive players. All the while, Gorou's father struggles with the end of his own baseball career. Can Gorou overcome the challenges ahead and face his former team, Kaido, on the field? The journey to Koshien is filled with obstacles, but Gorou's passion for baseball may just be the spark that ignites a new generation of players.",
