  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shou Yamato is an enthusiastic 11-year-old mountain biker who often practices at a track called the X-Zone with his friends Kakeru and Makoto. During a race against rivals one day, Shou and his friends are mysteriously transported to another world known as the X-Zone. In this strange new realm, Shou discovers mountain bike racing takes the extreme form of Idaten Battles - intense races through treacherous obstacle courses with hidden powers awakening in the bikes. To return home, Shou and friends learn they must compete in these battles and collect emblems by defeating rival riders. Though initially shocked, Shou soon becomes excited to test his skills against worthy opponents on spectacular courses ranging from volcanoes and ruins to deserts and snowy mountains. But conspiracies unfold against the group, and the races prove more dangerous than Shou ever imagined. To escape the X-Zone, Shou must tap into competitive spirit inherited from his late mountain biking champion father and bond with new allies to overcome adversity on the race tracks.",
