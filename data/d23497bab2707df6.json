  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In this set of 3 hilarious DVD specials, the infamous hitman Reborn takes on the persona of \"Mr. Rebokku,\" a flamboyant magician and talk show host. Brandishing a roulette wheel, he randomly selects various characters from the series to be guests on his show. The wacky interviews feature fan favorites like Tsuna, Xanxus, Hibari and more. Mr. Rebokku poses offbeat questions based on different themes, keeping the conversations lively and entertaining. However, those who give boring answers face dire consequences at the hands of their unforgiving host. With Reborn forcing participants to reply according to his whims and standards, tensions run high. Viewers are kept guessing as to who will manage to survive the absurd interviews intact. Overflowing with the series' signature humor and antics, these specials offer a fun dose of extra adventure with the KHR crew.",
