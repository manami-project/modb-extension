    "text": "Masquerading as the enigmatic Mr. Rebokku, Reborn takes on the role of a host in a series of three DVD specials, where he interviews a diverse array of characters chosen by a spinning roulette wheel. In the first episode, Tsunayoshi, Gokudera, and Xanxus find themselves in the hot seat, while the second episode features Hibari, Belphegor, and Dino as guests. Breaking from tradition, the third episode sees Reborn interviewing four characters: Byakuran, Mukuro, Squalo, and Yamamoto.\n\nWith each question centered around a theme, the stakes are high as guests must provide engaging answers to avoid a merciless punishment from their host. Using his powers to compel even the most reluctant participants to answer according to his standards, only the most quick-witted and entertaining guests will survive Mr. Rebokku's 'interviews'. Will your favorite character emerge victorious, or will they succumb to the whims of their mysterious host? Tune in to find out!",
