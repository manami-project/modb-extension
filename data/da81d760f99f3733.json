  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kei and Yuri, collectively known as the \"Dirty Pair,\" are agents working for the World Welfare Works Association (WWWA). In the first episode of this OVA, Kei teams up with a former agent named Calico to investigate a counterfeiter named Jobs Garou, who is hiding out in a villa protected by advanced security robots. After overcoming these defenses, they apprehend Garou. In the second episode, the WWWA's weapons research lab built inside a volcano has been attacked and their boss Chief Gooley has been kidnapped. The WWWA chairman wants to simply destroy the lab, but Kei and Yuri set out to rescue Gooley instead. They infiltrate the lab and confront the kidnapper, who turns out to be a megalomaniac threatening to destroy Eleanor City with the lab's weapons. The agents defeat him and rescue Gooley, though the lab is destroyed in the process. Originally intended to be the final two episodes of the Dirty Pair TV series before it was canceled, this OVA wraps up lingering plot threads and gives some closure to the show's main characters and overarching storylines. Focusing once more on the chaotic but caring partnership between Kei and Yuri, it delivers the show's signature blend of sci-fi action and lighthearted comedy.",
