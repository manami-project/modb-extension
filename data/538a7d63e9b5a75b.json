    "text": "The Cosmic Era is divided between genetically enhanced Coordinators and regular Naturals. After years of tensions, it escalates into war between the Coordinators' ZAFT forces and the Naturals' Earth Alliance. Kira is a young Coordinator living on the neutral space colony Heliopolis. When ZAFT attacks the colony to steal prototype mobile suits built for the Alliance, Kira inadvertently pilots the Strike Gundam into battle. He joins the Alliance forces to protect his friends. In the midst of the attack, Kira reconnects with his childhood Coordinator friend Athrun, who is revealed to be part of ZAFT's assault team. Now forced to fight on opposing sides, both are unwillingly drawn deeper into the war. Kira struggles with having to battle his own people, while facing his best friend in combat. As the war threatens those he cares for, Kira must find the resolve to keep fighting in the Gundam mobile suit, all while clinging to his ideals of peace and humanity.",
