    "text": "Kokonotsu dreams of becoming a manga artist, but his father has tasked him with managing the family's sweet shop during his absence. For three months, Kokonotsu has resisted this responsibility, letting the shop fall into disrepair. Suddenly, a girl named Hotaru appears, eager to introduce Kokonotsu to various Japanese snacks in hopes of swaying him toward the sweet shop. Meanwhile, Kokonotsu's friends Saya and Tou continue working at a local cafe. As Kokonotsu persists in chasing his artistic ambitions, the tenacious Hotaru refuses to abandon her mission to convert him into a snack food fanatic. New faces and tasty treats continue tempting Kokonotsu to take over the sweet shop, but the call of manga success still beckons him beyond this small town. Will Kokonotsu finally embrace his father's shop or ultimately depart to follow his dreams? Hotaru, armed with ever more outlandish snacks, seems determined to sway his decision one way or another.",
