Initially seeing Akito as her enemy, Sana decides to confront his bad behavior in hopes of restoring order to the classroom. But the more she interacts with him, the more Sana realizes there may be underlying reasons behind Akito's actions. As she strives to understand him better, an unexpected friendship forms between these two strong personalities.
