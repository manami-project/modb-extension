  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over 20 years ago, an evil summoner unleashed chaos upon the world through the 'Great Summoning', resulting in the deaths of a third of the human population and enabling demons and monsters to invade Earth. In present day, painter Tamura Fukutaro moves into the mysterious Ashiaraiyashiki apartment building, which houses an eccentric mix of human, demon, and mythical creature residents. As Tamura becomes embroiled in the affairs of his unusual neighbors, tensions flare between the building's inhabitants and powerful external forces like the ruler known as The Central. What begins as a simple hot pot dinner among Tamura and his friends sparks a brewing battle among gods, demons and humans over the fate of the world they uneasily share. With the stage set for conflict, the residents of Ashiaraiyashiki find themselves at the center of severe supernatural struggles.",
