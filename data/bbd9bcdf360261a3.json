    "text": "Tamura Fukutarou, a painter and a human resident of the enigmatic Ashiaraiyashiki apartment complex, extends an invitation to his eccentric friends for a shared meal of nabe, a traditional hot pot dish. Unbeknownst to many, this apartment complex is home to a diverse array of mythical creatures and demons, making daily life anything but ordinary.\n\nMore than two decades ago, a malevolent summoner performed the 'Great Summon', leading to the tragic loss of one-third of humanity and the subsequent invasion of Earth by devils and monsters. As Tamura Fukutarou finds himself entangled in the affairs of his non-human neighbors, he becomes embroiled in a fierce conflict involving gods, devils, and the supreme ruler, 'The Central'.\n\nJoin Tamura Fukutarou and his extraordinary friends as they navigate through a world of supernatural beings and intense battles, all unfolding within the confines of the mysterious Ashiaraiyashiki apartment complex.",
