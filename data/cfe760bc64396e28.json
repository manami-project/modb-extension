  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ashiya Hanae is an unlucky high school student who gets attacked by a mysterious fuzzy youkai on the first day of school, causing him to be confined to the infirmary. In desperation, he calls the Mononokean, a small tea room run by Abeno Haruitsuki, a morose-looking exorcist classmate. Abeno helps expel the youkai, but demands a huge fee which Ashiya cannot afford. To pay off his debt, Ashiya starts working at the Mononokean, assisting Abeno in guiding wayward youkai back to the underworld where they belong. Together, the odd duo encounters many strange and dangerous youkai. Through their adventures, they learn more about the mysterious world of spirits, and gain a grudging friendship and partnership. This is a tale about a morose exorcist master and his unlucky apprentice guiding wandering youkai to pass on to the next world.",
