  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Next in line for his high school journey, Koutarou Satomi finds himself in need of an affordable place to live. He stumbles upon a seemingly perfect solution: a small, six-tatami mat apartment in Corona House for a mere 5,000 yen per month. However, the room is anything but ordinary, as it soon becomes a battleground for a motley crew of supernatural girls, each vying for control.\n\nAmong the contenders is Sanae, a ghost who initially haunts the room in an attempt to drive Koutarou out. Joining her is Yurika, a magical girl who swoops in for an unwarranted rescue, seeking to protect a powerful magical source within the room. From beneath the earth emerges Kiriha, a descendant of the Earth People, who claims the apartment as a vital shrine for her people. Lastly, the alien princess Theiamillis steps through a portal, intent on securing Koutarou's loyalty.\n\nAs the landlady and classmate Shizuka attempts to maintain order amidst the chaos, Koutarou's high school life becomes anything but ordinary. In this comedic battle royale, the fate of Room 106 hangs in the balance as Koutarou and the girls engage in a series of hijinks to determine its rightful owner.",
