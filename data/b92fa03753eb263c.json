    "text": "School's in session for the quiet, academically gifted Hibino Tsubaki, but her first day of high school doesn't go as planned. Despite her love for styling hair, she sports simple braids and finds herself sitting next to the school's top student, Kyouta Tsubaki, who shares her last name. To her dismay, he's the rudest boy she's ever met. When Kyouta takes her first kiss, Tsubaki retaliates by giving him a haircut. But instead of being upset, Kyouta vows to claim all her firsts. As they navigate the trials and tribulations of high school, will the unlikely pair find common ground or remain at odds? Only time will tell in this heartwarming tale of love, growth, and the power of a good haircut.",
