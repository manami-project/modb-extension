  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There exists a realm where the divine and human worlds have begun to drift apart, causing concern among the gods. To bridge this gap, the mighty Zeus establishes a school that mirrors those of the human world and summons Yui Kusanagi, an ordinary human girl, to educate the young gods about humanity and the essence of love. Stumbling upon a luminous sword in a shed, Yui is transported to this divine school, where she encounters a series of handsome gods. With a year's deadline looming, Yui must successfully impart human values and emotions to these reluctant gods, or else they will be confined to the school grounds forever. As Yui embarks on this extraordinary journey, she fosters connections and navigates the complexities of love among gods and humans alike.",
