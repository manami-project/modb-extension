  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokyo in the 1970s is plagued by evil spirits threatening the human world. To combat this, a ragtag group called the \"Demon Patrol\" is assembled, consisting of hotheaded demon prince Enma, an aloof ice princess Yukiko, a enthusiastic frog-demon spy Kapael, and an elderly wizard hat named Chapeau-jii. Though eccentric, the group is tasked with protecting Earth by fending off various quirky demons through chaotic and humorous means. From vengeful squids to sleepy cats to literal buttheads, the Demon Patrol encounters an array of bizarre enemies. Despite their absurdity, the stakes are high - if the Patrol fails, the demon hordes could bring ruin to Earth. Thus begins the Patrol's comedic adventure to defend humankind in this retro-style supernatural action-comedy.",
