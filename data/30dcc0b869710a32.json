    "text": "Kyoto Animation and other renowned studios join forces with famous comic creators to present \"ANIMATION Ã— PARALYMPIC: Who Is Your Hero?\", a captivating series of short anime films that shine a spotlight on the inspiring world of para-sports. With the Tokyo 2020 Paralympic Games on the horizon, this project aims to spark curiosity and passion for the Paralympics by introducing viewers to fictional yet relatable athletes who embody the spirit of perseverance and determination.\n\nEach episode of this unique series focuses on a different para-sport, featuring diverse characters and stories that showcase the true potential of athletes with impairments. From blind soccer players designed by Yoichi Takahashi (Captain Tsubasa) to a resilient female sprinter with a prosthetic leg crafted by Eisaku Kubonouchi (Hungry Days: Aoharu ka yo), these animations are sure to captivate and inspire audiences.\n\nThough an episode by Kyoto Animation was initially scheduled for August 2019, it was later cancelled due to a heartbreaking arson attack on the studio. Nevertheless, the series remains committed to expanding its coverage of para-sports and introducing new heroes to the world stage by 2020. Prepare to be moved and motivated by these extraordinary tales of courage and triumph.",
