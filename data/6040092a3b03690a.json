    "text": "This lost 1917 anime short is regarded as the first publicly screened Japanese animation. Created by pioneering animator Shimokawa Hekoten and produced by Tenkatsu studio, it was made using chalk drawings on a blackboard. Shimokawa drew the backgrounds and characters, erasing overlapping parts with white paint. Through repetitive filming of slight alterations, the first recorded animation of Japan was completed. While it did screen several times at Tenkatsu, there is debate around its public theater release. Some speculate it was not actually shown in theaters, as no records exist in major film magazines of the time. Its story contents remain a complete mystery, as no copies are known to exist. There's a chance it was reworked and released later under a different title. Though its public screening is uncertain, this chalk-animated short nonetheless represents a milestone in early Japanese animation. Led by Shimokawa's inventive style, it set the course for the country's later animated works.",
