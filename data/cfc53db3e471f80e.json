  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows four high school girls in their final year - Yui, Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi - who are members of their school's light music club. Along with their junior member Azusa, they spend their afternoons enjoying tea and sweets while practicing music together in the club room. As the summer holidays come to an end, the girls want to take one last overseas trip with the club before the new semester starts. With so many potential travel destinations and preferences among the members, they struggle to decide on where to go. They then remember that first they'll need to apply for new passports. What seems like a simple government office visit to file paperwork turns into an all-day adventure for the whole band. While still working on their trip plans, the girls' daily life continues - practicing for their new student orientation performance, recruiting new club members between their other student responsibilities, and always making time for their beloved afternoon tea. With graduation and college entrance exams approaching, they ultimately decide to postpone the overseas retreat until after they graduate, as one last hurrah for the tight-knit group.",
