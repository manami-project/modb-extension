    "text": "Lina Inverse, the hot-tempered and flat-chested sorceress, continues her adventures along with her tall and handsome companion Gourry. They reunite with the righteous princess Amelia and the chimera Zelgadis in the kingdom of Luvinagard, where they meet the scheming Inspector Wiser. Despite not committing any crimes, Lina finds herself blamed for various incidents like destroying tanks and stealing pets due to her notorious reputation. After each case, she and her friends manage to uncover the real culprit. Lina also faces a new potential foe in Pokota, a tiny but powerful creature who leaves a trail of destruction behind him. There is more to Pokota than meets the eye. If Lina's group can get to the bottom of why he keeps blowing things up, they may gain a formidable ally. With so much explosive magic between them all, one thing is for certain - their journey is never boring!",
