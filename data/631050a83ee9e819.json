  "synopsis": {
    "text": "October 25.\n\nIn the bustling city of Tokyo, each ward houses a unique department dedicated to managing supernatural occurrences. Enter Miyako Arata, a fresh recruit assigned to Shinjuku Ward's Nocturnal Community Relations Division. Arata possesses an extraordinary ability: he can comprehend non-human languages. As he embarks on his new role, he crosses paths with a mysterious youkai at the Shinjuku Imperial Gardens, who eerily identifies him as the legendary Heian-era exorcist, Abe no Seimei.\n\nArata's journey takes an unexpected turn when he falls prey to a cunning trick orchestrated by a trio of foxes. In the midst of this deception, Reiji recounts a tale from fifteen years ago, when a fox brought him and Theo together on the sacred grounds of a shrine. United by fate, the duo collaborates to help an Another lift the dreaded Kodoku curse.\n\nThis captivating tale unfolds in two unaired episodes of Mayonaka no Occult Koumuin, initially streamed exclusively on Hikari TV on September 25, and later released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 25.",
