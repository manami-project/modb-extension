  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Miyako Arata begins working in the Shinjuku Ward Nocturnal Community Relations Division, which handles paranormal and occult events in Tokyo. When Arata encounters a supernatural creature at Shinjuku Imperial Gardens, it recognizes him as the reincarnation of the legendary exorcist Abe no Seimei due to Arata's ability to understand non-human speech. In another incident, Arata is deceived by three foxes. His coworker Reiji then recounts a story from 15 years ago where a fox caused Reiji to meet his paranormal investigation partner Theo by trapping them together at a shrine. By working together, the two young men helped lift a curse placed on an otherworldly being. Additionally, there are two unaired episodes of the anime that explore more supernatural cases handled by the department. These episodes provide more insight into the characters and their abilities in confronting occult phenomena around Tokyo.",
