    "text": "Will Melos, a humble Greek countryman, make it back in time to save his friend Selinentius, a gifted sculptor, from facing the wrath of the king? Accused of plotting against the monarch, Melos is granted a brief reprieve to attend his sister's wedding, but the clock is ticking. With only three days and his own two feet to cover the distance, Melos embarks on a desperate journey, knowing that if he fails, Selinentius will pay the ultimate price in his stead. Inspired by an ancient Greek legend, this gripping tale of friendship, loyalty, and determination unfolds in an intense race against time.",
