    "text": "Ryouken is a young man beset by tragedy, having lost his family in an accident. In his despair, he finds solace in the teachings of the high priest Rennyo, who provides spiritual wisdom on finding meaning in life. Inspired, Ryouken becomes Rennyo's devoted apprentice. As followers flock to Rennyo's Honganji temple, rival Buddhist sects grow resentful, forcing Rennyo and Ryouken to flee Kyoto. Seeking a new place to spread their message of hope, the two men journey to the remote Hokuriku region, arriving in the village of Yoshizaki. Despite adversity, Ryouken perseveres, sustained by his newfound faith. As Rennyo's student, he aspires to touch the lives of others who suffer, sharing the restorative power of spiritual truth. Though exiled from the capital, the two monks continue their work, lighting a beacon of hope in a darkened land.",
