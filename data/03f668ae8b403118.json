  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Araragi, a second-year student at Naoetsu High School, finds an unexpected friend in the top-ranking student, Tsubasa Hanekawa. Their conversation takes a mysterious turn when Hanekawa shares a local rumor about a blonde vampire sighted in their town. Intrigued but dismissive, Araragi continues his day, only to stumble upon the very vampire mentioned in the rumor. The ethereal creature, Kiss-shot Acerola-orion Heart-under-blade, also known as the King of Apparitions, lies in a pool of her own blood, her limbs severed. In a desperate plea, Kiss-shot begs Araragi for his blood to save her life. When he complies, Araragi awakens to a new realityâ€”he has been reborn as a vampire. Struggling to accept his new existence, Araragi hears Kiss-shot's chilling welcome to the world of darkness. This is the first season of the Monogatari Series, featuring the Koyomi Vamp arc from the Kizumonogatari light novel.",
