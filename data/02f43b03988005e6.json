    "text": "To the average observer, Masaharu Tsuwabuki, or Haru, is just another middle school student. However, his life takes an unexpected turn when a mysterious potion transforms him into a small, stuffed sheep at nightfall. To break this enchantment and regain his human form, Haru must gather elusive stardrops that descend from the heavens. To accomplish this, he must rely on the assistance of a 'chosen one' who remains unaware of his true identity.\n\nIn a twist of fate, the chosen one turns out to be Sumomo Akihime, a reserved classmate of Haru's. As they embark on their quest to collect the stardrops, Haru must juggle his ordinary daytime existence with his secret nighttime identity as a stuffed sheep. As they work together, Haru and Sumomo grow closer, forging a bond that transcends the boundaries of their unique situation. Will they be able to collect all the stardrops and restore Haru's human form, or will their secret mission prove too challenging? Only time will tell in the enchanting tale of Nanatsuiro Drops.",
