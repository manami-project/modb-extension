Seeking solace, she begins working at a local family restaurant where she finds herself drawn to the kind and compassionate manager, Masami Kondou, a divorced father in his mid-forties. Despite the significant age gap, Akira finds herself falling in love with Kondou's gentle nature, which others often mistake for weakness. As their bond deepens, Akira struggles to understand her feelings and musters the courage to confess her love to Kondou. Will their love blossom, or will the societal norms and age gap prove to be an insurmountable obstacle? Join Akira and Masami in \"After the Rain\" as they navigate the complexities of love and self-discovery.",
