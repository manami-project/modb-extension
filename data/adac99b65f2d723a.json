    "text": "Yamato's life as a second-year student at Kawakami Academy is far from ordinary. Along with his six childhood friends, they form an unbreakable bond, with a shared lineage that traces back to the legendary samurai. In a city where samurai heritage and fighting spirit are the cornerstones of society, these seven friends navigate the challenges of school, sports, and preserving age-old traditions.\n\nHowever, the group dynamics take a thrilling turn with the arrival of two new members, both girls. As the group expands, so do the complications, with unexpected distractions and rivalries emerging. The once balanced group must now adapt to these changes while striving to uphold their samurai heritage.\n\nIn this whirlwind of friendships, rivalries, and blossoming romance, Yamato and his friends must navigate their adolescent years, all while honoring their samurai ancestors. Join them in their exciting journey, as they discover that sometimes, nine can be a riot, and that there's more to being a samurai than just wielding a sword!",
