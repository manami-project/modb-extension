    "text": "Ocean's depths once cradled a glorious continent, now decimated by relentless wars and merciless natural disasters. In this desolate world, three brave adventurers—Tieh, Lakushi, and Bois—traverse a vast desert, their only ambition to live another day. One fateful evening, they stumble upon a chilling crime scene: foreign travelers brutally tortured to death. The dying survivor, Lifas, reveals their quest for a legendary treasure and the ruthless robbers who attacked them.\n\nAs the trio's own thirst intensifies, they serendipitously discover an abandoned city nearby. Azec Sistra, the fabled city of the dead, is said to be cursed, with no one ever returning from its haunting grasp. The city's mummified inhabitants, remnants of a long-lost culture, continue their eternal duties in a desperate attempt to defy death. The robbers who murdered the travelers have also infiltrated the city, seeking its legendary treasure, and disrespecting the dead in the process.\n\nThe three friends must now navigate the treacherous city, avoiding the wrath of the mummified spirits while also confronting the vicious robbers. As they delve deeper into the heart of Azec Sistra, they'll need to rely on their unique skills, extreme caution, and mutual respect for the dead to survive and uncover the truth behind the city's mysterious curse.",
