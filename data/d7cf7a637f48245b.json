  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Devil King beware, as Kazuma Sato, a once ordinary game-loving shut-in, finds himself reborn in a parallel RPG-inspired world after a tragic accident. Joined by Aqua, a self-proclaimed goddess with questionable usefulness; Megumin, an archwizard with a one-spell-per-day limit; and Darkness, a masochistic crusader with terrible aim, Kazuma embarks on a series of misadventures to make ends meet.\n\nWhen not battling the forces of the Demon King, Kazuma and his dysfunctional party must navigate the perils of everyday life in the town of Axel. From dealing with collateral damage caused by Megumin's explosive magic to avoiding the corrupt legal system that accuses Kazuma of treason, this band of unlikely heroes can't seem to catch a break.\n\nAs Kazuma's fate hangs in the balance, Darkness must call upon her noble status to save him from certain doom. But with the Demon King still looming, can Kazuma and his friends put aside their differences and rise to the challenge? Join Kazuma on his wild journey through this fantastical world, where the only thing more unpredictable than his adventures is his eccentric party.",
