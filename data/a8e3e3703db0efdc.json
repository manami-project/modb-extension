    "text": "Iro Iro no Tane, a short film exclusively screened at the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, is a delightful adaptation of a picture book by Rieko Nakagawa and Yuriko Yamawaki. The nine-minute short follows the story of a young boy named Yuji and his rabbit friend, Gick, as they discover a walking stick and compete in various games to determine its rightful owner. From foot races to long jumps and sumo wrestling, the pair always find themselves in a tie. Seeking a solution, they consult Gick's wise Granny, who suggests a treasure hunt. Who will emerge victorious in this friendly competition? Only the treasure hunt will reveal the answer.",
