  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around a love triangle between Tomoya Okazaki and twin sisters Ryou and Kyou Fujibayashi. Initially, Ryou confesses her feelings to Tomoya, who decides to date her to get to know her better. Ryou is elated to be with Tomoya, but soon rumors spread about him and Kyou. It is revealed that Kyou has romantic feelings for Tomoya but is repressing them for her sister's sake. Tomoya finds himself caught between the two sisters, unsure of who has truly won his heart. Kyou sacrifices her own happiness so that Ryou can be with Tomoya. However, an alternate storyline explores what would happen if Kyou was the main heroine instead of Ryou. Here, both sisters acknowledge their love for Tomoya and must determine if their bond as siblings is more important than pursuing romance. Whichever sister Tomoya ultimately chooses, the story explores the exhilaration of young love as well as the painful truth that someone will end up heartbroken. The emotional web created by this love triangle leads all three characters to realize where their true affections lie.",
