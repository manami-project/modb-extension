    "text": "Na Lan Yan Ran, the daughter of a powerful family, is betrothed to Xiao Yan, a prodigy hailing from the world of \"Dou Po Cangqiong.\" In this realm, strength reigns supreme, and Xiao Yan's extraordinary abilities set him apart from his peers. However, his world crumbles on his 11th birthday when his powers mysteriously vanish, leaving him the weakest in his village. To preserve her family's prestige, Na Lan decides to call off the engagement, refusing to be tied to a powerless husband.\n\nInfuriated by her decision, Xiao Yan challenges Na Lan to a duel, with the stakes being their engagement. If he wins, he gains control over her future; if she wins, she is free to break the engagement. The duel is set to take place three years later, giving Xiao Yan a chance to regain his lost powers and reclaim his former glory. Will he rise to the challenge and rekindle his dormant abilities, or will he succumb to his newfound weakness?",
