She has been in a long-term relationship with her boyfriend Yuuta Togashi. As Rikka's high school graduation and college entrance exams approach, her older sister Touka declares that she has found a stable job in Italy and intends to bring Rikka and the rest of their family with her to live there. Yuuta understands Touka's perspective but is distraught over potentially being separated from Rikka. At the suggestion of their friends, Yuuta and Rikka decide to elope in order to stay together.
