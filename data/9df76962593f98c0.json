  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Factory worker Takeichi and his friend, the troubled artist Yozo Oba, live in a dystopian Tokyo of 2036, where a revolution in medical treatment has eradicated disease and extended human lifespan to 120 years through the use of nanomachines and the S.H.E.L.L. system. However, this technological advancement has also created a stark divide between the rich and the poor, and those who disconnect from the system become monstrous creatures known as the \"Lost.\"\n\nWhen Takeichi convinces Yozo to join him in a protest against their inhumane living conditions, their plan goes awry, and both are transformed into Lost. However, Yozo discovers he has the unique ability to return to human form, and he joins forces with Yoshiko Hiiragi, a member of the anti-Lost agency H.I.L.A.M., to investigate the recent surge in Human Lost phenomena.\n\nAs Yozo navigates this world of degradation and death, he must confront his own demons and decide whether he is a human lost or a human who can find himself. With the fate of civilization hanging in the balance, Yozo embarks on a journey of self-discovery and redemption that will change his life forever.",
