    "text": "Along side his fellow Kyudo club members, Minato Narumiya has rediscovered his love for the traditional Japanese martial art of archery. Following their triumph at the prefectural tournament, the Kazemai High School Kyudo Club is eager to prove that their victory was no mere stroke of luck. However, the emergence of a mysterious new team from Tsujimine High School and the rekindling of old rivalries with Kirisaki High School threaten to disrupt their ambitions.\n\nAs the men's team grapples with the shifting dynamics, the women's team, consisting of Rika, Yuna, and Noa, prepares to make their mark in their first tournament. With the regional tournament fast approaching, the stakes are raised even higher by a special rule change celebrating the event's 40th anniversary: the winning team will also secure a spot in the nationals.\n\nAs the competition intensifies, Minato and his teammates must confront their past and face off against formidable opponents, including Minato's former upperclassman. With each arrow released from their bows, the members of the Kazemai High School Kyudo Club strive to stay on target and prove their worth in TSURUNE - THE LINKING SHOT!",
