    "text": "At the heart of this chilling anime is Asuka, an ordinary high school student, who finds herself in an extraordinary situation when she encounters the spirit of a deceased classmate, Haruka. Haunted by Haruka's plea to locate her dismembered body, Asuka, along with her brave friends, embarks on a perilous journey within the confines of their school.\n\nTheir search is made more treacherous by the ominous presence of the Red Person, a sinister entity that preys on students who find themselves alone in the school. The Red Person's modus operandi is as gruesome as it is mysterious: it scatters the victim's body into eight pieces and assigns the grim task of gathering these pieces to another unsuspecting student.\n\nAsuka and her friends must find all eight parts of Haruka's body to break the cycle of death and repetition. Failure is not an option, as it would condemn them to relive the same day and face the Red Person's wrath again and again.\n\nWho is the Red Person, and why does it perpetuate this horrifying cycle? Why was Haruka chosen, and what secrets does she hold? Unravel these mysteries and more in this gripping anime that blends suspense, horror, and the supernatural.",
