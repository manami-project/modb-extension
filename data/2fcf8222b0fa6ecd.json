    "text": "Japan is under an unusual threat, as adorable extraterrestrials have started invading the country. To combat these charming intruders, a unique defense force is assembled, consisting of three spirited 8-year-old girls. Leading the team is Mao Onigawara, the granddaughter of the Ground Defense Force's Chief of Staff, who works alongside her best friends, Misora and Sylvia, the granddaughters of the Air and Marine Defense Force's commanders-in-chief.\n\nArmed with cloverleaf-shaped badges that allow them to transform, these young heroines might not gain any extraordinary powers, but they possess the perfect blend of innocence and determination to face the cuddly alien menace. As members of the Defense Force Team, Mao, Misora, and Sylvia are guided by their team commander, Kagome. Together, they form an unconventional yet lovable line of defense against the onslaught of cute invaders, proving that sometimes, the best way to fight cuteness is with even more cuteness!",
