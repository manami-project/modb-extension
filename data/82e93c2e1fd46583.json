Welcome to the world of Nao and Shuusuke Takanashi, where sibling rivalry takes on a whole new meaning.\n\nNao is hell-bent on making her brother see her as a woman, going so far as to invade his personal space and dispose of his non-incestuous adult content. But when she stumbles upon a photo album filled with childhood memories that don't include her, Nao's fixation on Shuusuke intensifies.\n\nMeanwhile, Shuusuke finds himself in a complicated love triangle when his childhood friend, Iroha Tsuchiura, re-enters his life and expresses her affections for him. As Nao's attempts to monopolize her brother's romantic attention become more desperate, the dynamics of their relationship teeter on the edge of dangerous territory.\n\nWill Nao succeed in her quest to win her brother's heart, or will the arrival of Iroha force her to confront the reality of her feelings? Find out in this gripping anime that explores the complexities of family, love, and obsession.",
