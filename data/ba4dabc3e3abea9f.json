  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kappei Sakamoto is an exceptionally talented athlete despite his short stature. Though adept at various sports, his true passion lies in basketball, which he plays for his high school team. However, Kappei has an unusual fixation with women's underwear, particularly plain white panties. He constantly tries to catch glimpses under the skirts of girls around him, including his basketball coach Natsu and his housemate Akane Aki, who he secretly admires. As Kappei leads his team to victory through numerous basketball tournaments, relying on the 'good omen' of spying white underwear, his antics get him into humorous trouble. Yet his athletic skill and determination ultimately prevail in helping his school remain undefeated. Though quirky, Kappei is unwavering in his quest for sports glory, girl-chasing escapades, and white panty peeking.",
