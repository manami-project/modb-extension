    "text": "Youko and Osamu Sonoyama, a loving but aging couple, yearn to adopt every child from Soramame House, but their advanced age forces them to choose just one. Captivated by the enchanting beauty and gentle demeanor of a particular child, they welcome 13-year-old Hitori into their home. However, Hitori's humble and overly courteous facade hides a secret: the twins Migi and Dali, who take turns playing the role of the perfect child. The twins, endowed with exceptional physical and mental abilities, aim to infiltrate a quiet town and uncover the truth behind a past tragedy that left them seeking vengeance. As they work tirelessly to maintain their cover and protect their newfound happiness, they must also navigate the complexities of their sinister plans and the secrets they keep from their unsuspecting parents.",
