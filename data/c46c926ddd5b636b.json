    "text": "Hikaru, Koji, and their newfound friend, Daisuke Umon, share a common goal: to protect Earth from the imminent threat of King Vega and his formidable Vegan empire. Unbeknownst to many, Daisuke is actually Duke Fleed, the last surviving prince of the once-thriving Fleed Planet. After witnessing his home's destruction and the tragic loss of his family at the hands of the Vegan forces, Duke managed to escape with the powerful UFO Grendizer, a robotic embodiment of the Fleedian God of War.\n\nCrash-landing on Earth near Mount Fuji, Duke is adopted by the kind-hearted Dr. Umon, who raises him as his own son, Daisuke. As the Vegan empire sets its sights on Earth, Daisuke is forced to confront his past and embrace his true identity as Duke Fleed. Together with his friends and the mighty Grendizer, Duke stands as Earth's last line of defense against the ruthless Vegan forces, determined to prevent history from repeating itself. Will Duke and his allies succeed in stopping King Vega's invasion and saving their new home?",
