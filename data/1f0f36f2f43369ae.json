  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Frustrated with the monotonous afterlife in this mysterious school, a new student suddenly erupts during a test, angrily questioning if good grades truly lead to Heaven. As classmates and teachers stand stunned, unable to appease the boy's outburst, the new Student Council President intervenes. Possessing intimate knowledge of the school's inner workings and disillusionment from his own past rebellion, this familiar face calmly enlightens the new student on the futility of resistance and provides insight into the enigmatic system governing the school. Though details remain vague, it seems this purgatorial academy measures more than academic performance alone, with ascending to Heaven an elusive aim for all trapped within its walls. Will the new student heed the President's hard-learned lessons or futilely rebel against the intricate machinery guiding this stygian school?",
