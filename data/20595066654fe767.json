  "synopsis": {
    "text": "City 7, a colossal space station and part of the Macross 7 fleet, embarks on a mission in 2045 to find new habitats for humans following the legendary battle with Bodolza's Main Fleet. The station, complete with forests, factories, and a holographic sky, becomes the target of an enigmatic alien race known as the Varauta. Instead of conventional attacks, the Varauta steal a unique energy called 'Spiritia' from their victims, leaving them comatose.\n\nNekki Basara, a guitarist and lead singer of the band Fire Bomber, resides in a less-developed part of City 7. Believing in the transformative power of music, Basara takes his red Valkyrie into the heart of the battlefield, armed with his songs and loudspeakers. As the Varauta launch their assaults, Basara's bandmates - half-Zentraedi Mylene Jenius, band leader Ray Lovelock, and Zentraedi drummer Bihida - join him in the fight, using their music to repel the enemy.\n\nDespite the ongoing attacks and the increasing number of Spiritia-drained victims, the Macross 7 leadership decides to embrace Basara's unconventional approach. With the future of City 7 hanging in the balance, can Nekki Basara and Fire Bomber harness the power of their songs to save humanity from the mysterious Varauta?",
