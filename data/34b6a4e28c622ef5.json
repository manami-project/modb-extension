  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hundred-Year War draws to a close, Colonel Yoran Pailsen faces court-martial for his controversial tactics, leaving him under military intelligence's watchful eye. Meanwhile, Chirico Cuvie, the lone survivor of the Loumes assault, finds himself in a specialized unit comprising five Armored Trooper (AT) pilots on the planet Galeade. This new unit, allegedly assembled for their combat prowess, presents Chirico with unlikely allies: a soldier who doubts his own abilities and a young boy with a vendetta. Unbeknownst to them, their perilous missions are part of a clandestine experiment orchestrated by none other than Pailsen himself. This new chapter in the 'Armored Trooper Votoms' series, rendered in cutting-edge 3D CG animation, invites viewers to unravel the enigmatic connection between these seemingly disparate pilots and their high-stakes missions.",
