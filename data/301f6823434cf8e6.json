    "text": "Why not spend the night together in a tent? That's what Kensuke Yamamichi thought when he offered shelter to four young women during his solo camping trip. Natsuki Kitamura, Aki Minami, Touko Saionji, and the youthful Haruki Azuma were the unexpected guests who disrupted Kensuke's peaceful retreat in nature. However, what started as a one-night act of kindness turns into a daily adventure as these women begin showing up at his workplace. Little did Kensuke know that his ordinary life would take a spicy turn, filled with unexpected twists and revelations about his new acquaintances. As he navigates this new reality, Kensuke must deal with his own jealousy and the consequences of playing a trick on the enigmatic Haruki. The result of being in such close quarters with these defenseless girls is anyone's guess, but one thing is certain: Kensuke's life will never be the same.",
