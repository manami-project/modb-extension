  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kensuke Yamamichi decides to go on a solo camping trip to enjoy nature, but his plans change when three women - Natsuki, Aki, and Touko - along with Haruki, end up at his campsite late one evening needing a place to stay. Still resentful that Haruki is traveling with three attractive women, Kensuke plays a trick trying to expose Haruki's actual gender, only to discover Haruki is not the young man he appeared to be. With everyone crowded into his small tent for the night, the women seem to invite Kensuke to have his way with them. This camping trip marks the start of a spicey daily life back in the city, intersecting the worlds of Kensuke and his new tent companions.",
