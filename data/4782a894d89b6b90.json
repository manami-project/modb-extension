    "text": "Kentaro Miura's acclaimed dark fantasy series Berserk follows the journey of Guts, a lone mercenary swordsman haunted by a traumatic past. After being defeated by Griffith, the charismatic leader of the Band of the Hawk mercenaries, Guts is forced to join their ranks. Though initially distrustful, he bonds with Griffith and the other Hawks through shared hardships on the battlefield. As the Band of the Hawk rises to become a full army under Midland's king, Guts begins to doubt his solitary existence as Griffith's ambition grows. Unbeknownst to Guts, his fate and Griffith's are tragically intertwined. When Griffith sacrifices the Band of the Hawk to fulfill his dream of ruling a kingdom, Guts loses everything and embarks on a perilous quest for vengeance, pursued by demonic forces from another realm. With themes of isolation, ambition's cost, and the darkness in human nature, Berserk is an unflinching epic fantasy chronicling one man's struggle against seemingly insurmountable adversity. Miura's masterful storytelling and breathtaking artwork bring to life a violent yet moving tale of defiance in the face of destiny.",
