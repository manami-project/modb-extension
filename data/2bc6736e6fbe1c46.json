    "text": "Saturn, Dreamcast, and Mega Drive, three girls named after iconic Sega consoles, find themselves embarking on a unique educational journey at SeHaGaga Academy. Located near Tokyo's Haneda ÅŒtorii station, this is no ordinary school. In order to graduate, the trio must navigate through various Sega game worlds, collecting 100 medals under the watchful eye of their enigmatic teacher, Center-sensei.\n\nDreamcast, the optimistic and sociable one, is eager to excel academically and socially. She forms a bond with the ambitious Saturn and the knowledgeable Mega Drive. Together, they face the unpredictable challenges of the Sega game worlds, starting with the pixelated battlegrounds of \"Virtua Fighter\". However, the path to graduation is fraught with peculiar adversaries and stringent rules, making their goal anything but simple.\n\nAs they delve deeper into the nostalgic realms of classic Sega games, the girls must rely on their wits, skills, and camaraderie to overcome the obstacles. From battling blocky polygons to showcasing their dance moves in \"Space Channel 5\", each challenge is a testament to their determination and resilience.\n\nMeanwhile, a high school boy named Takeo Kanbara and his sister Yui find their lives intertwined with a middle-school goddess who has come to live with them. This divine encounter adds an intriguing twist to the already extraordinary narrative of the Sega Hard Girls. Will the girls successfully navigate their way through the Sega game worlds and graduate, or will they be stuck in this pixelated labyrinth forever? Only time will tell.",
