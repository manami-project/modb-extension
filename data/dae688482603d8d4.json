    "text": "Kazuhiko Nukumizu is a quiet high school student who prefers to blend into the background. However, his peaceful life is disrupted when he witnesses a popular classmate, Anna Yanami, attempt to confess her feelings to her childhood friend, only to be rejected. This unexpected event leads Kazuhiko to cross paths with Anna as well as other girls who have faced romantic defeat - girls dubbed \"losing heroines.\" Despite his introverted nature, Kazuhiko finds himself entangled in the personal drama and love lives of Anna and other losing heroines. As Kazuhiko gets to know these girls, including the energetic track star Lemon Yakishio and shy animal-lover Chika Komari, he discovers that even those who have lost in love have radiant sides to them. His encounters with the losing heroines open his eyes to new perspectives on life, love, and what it means to shine. Captivated by their stories, Kazuhiko realizes his role as an observer of life has changed - he is now in the midst of coming-of-age tales full of youth, bonds, tears, and laughter.",
