  "synopsis": {
    "text": "By 2008, otaku culture in Japan had been brutally suppressed by the enigmatic SSC, an organization intent on eradicating this unique subculture. In just one week, the SSC managed to capture almost every otaku, leaving their memorabilia confiscated and their spirit crushed. But one man, Otaku Hero, refused to let this injustice prevail. Gathering a resistance army of fellow enthusiasts, they embark on a daring mission to reclaim their freedom of expression.\n\nThree years into the rebellion, Otaku Hero is joined by three magical girls: Anarchy, Blue, and Pink. United by their love for otaku culture, they strive to create a world where everyone can express their passions freely. As the resistance grows, they challenge the SSC's leader, Shobon, in a desperate attempt to restore the once-thriving otaku haven, Akihabara.\n\nWith the future of otaku culture hanging in the balance, Otaku Hero and the magical girls embark on a thrilling journey filled with camaraderie, hope, and the unwavering belief that everyone should be free to celebrate their passions without fear of persecution.",
