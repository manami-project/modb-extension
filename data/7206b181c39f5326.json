  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ai, an apprentice undine, is practicing gondola rowing under the guidance of her mentor Akari. As they travel through the canals, they have a chance encounter with Akari's friends Aika and Alice, who are now Prima undines like Akari. The three of them reminisce about old times, as their busy schedules allow them to meet rarely these days. Akari relates an incident to Ai about witnessing a 'miracle' during her own training days. She saw something magical while on an unfamiliar route, which led her to meet fellow undines also in training. Through this, Akari conveys to Ai that even with their evolving roles and responsibilities, the beauty and wonders of Neo Venezia have remained constant. She encourages Ai to appreciate the small miracles around her on her journey to becoming a Prima undine. Though Akari now has the duties of running her own company, the connections she's made on Aqua remain as comforting constants amidst changing tides. As Ai prepares to take on more obligations herself, Akari's guidance helps her find magic in the everyday and look forward to forging her own bonds as an undine.",
