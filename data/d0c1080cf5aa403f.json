    "text": "Houjouâ€™s heir, Tokiyuki, is an eight-year-old boy living in feudal Japan, with a talent for hide-and-seek and a life of peace and play. However, his world is shattered when the Kamakura shogunate is betrayed and overthrown by Ashikaga Takauji. Tokiyuki's family is brutally murdered, and he becomes the last surviving member of his clan. With his life in danger, Tokiyuki must rely on his hide-and-seek skills to evade his enemies and survive. A self-proclaimed prophetic priest rescues him, and together they set out to restore the Kamakura shogunate. Tokiyuki must recruit allies and overcome his aversion to conflict to reclaim his rightful place as shogun and avenge his family. This is a thrilling tale of redemption and survival, set during the Nanboku-chou period of Japanese history, about a young boy who alters Japan's destiny by running away.",
