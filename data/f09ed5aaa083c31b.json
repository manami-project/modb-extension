    "text": "Who is the true hero when power falls into the hands of the unassuming and the malevolent? Meet Ichiro Inuyashiki, a 58-year-old office worker who, despite his kind heart, is constantly disregarded by his family and colleagues. To make matters worse, a cancer diagnosis leaves him with little time to live. However, when a mysterious light from the sky strikes him, Ichiro finds himself reborn as a powerful robot.\n\nIn contrast, Hiro Shishigami, a high school student with a dark heart, is also transformed by the same event. While Ichiro uses his newfound abilities to save lives and earn the respect he never had, Hiro indulges in his darkest desires. As their paths intertwine, the question arises: Will Ichiro's compassionate nature triumph over Hiro's sinister intentions? Join the journey to discover the true essence of humanity in this gripping tale of power, transformation, and moral choices.",
