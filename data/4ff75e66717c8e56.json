  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Chise Hatori as she attends a magic college with her familiar Elias Ainsworth, who works there as a teacher. The college has been completely isolated from the outside world by magical barriers and patrolled by golems after a series of attacks left students and teachers drained of magic. Trapped inside, tensions rise amongst the students as the mysterious illnesses continue despite the isolation measures. Chise's classmate Philomela Sargant is unable to comply with her controlling grandmother's demands to leave the school. Her health and mental state deteriorate over time. Details about the tragic past of Chise's roommate Lucy Webster also come to light. Chise tries to support her friends while also coming to terms with her own evolving identity and magical abilities. The culprit behind the magical attacks has yet to be uncovered. Chise and her friends race to solve the mystery and restore safety before more damage is done. But powerful external magical forces also seem to be interfering from outside the sealed college. This next cour promises more magical adventures and growth for Chise and the colorful cast of characters she befriends in the isolated, besieged environment of the college.",
