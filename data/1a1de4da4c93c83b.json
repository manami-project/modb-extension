  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japans' ancient lore speaks of a time when three formidable gods reigned supreme, with the most fearsome being Susano-oh, a god of chaos and destruction. After being exiled to the underworld, Susano-oh vanquished the monstrous eight-tailed serpent of Yamata, earning the title of the God of Darkness. In the present day, signs of Susano-oh's resurrection are becoming evident, causing the Kikuchi clan, descendants of Japan's earliest inhabitants, to take action. Armed with ancient artifacts and knowledge, they must find a young boy, Takahashi, who bears the mark of the serpent and is chosen by destiny to confront the God of Darkness. As darkness spreads and the fate of mankind hangs in the balance, Takahashi, haunted by his father's murder, must face his fears and embrace his destiny. Will he be able to control the chaotic power of the gods and prevent the impending doom? Only time will tell in this chilling and complex tale of ancient Japanese mythology and modern horror.",
