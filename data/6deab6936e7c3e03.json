    "text": "When a terrorist group, Ghost of Icarus, targets the Daedalus Corporation with a devastating bombing, unconventional surgeon Kuroo \"Black Jack\" Hazama is unwittingly drawn into the chaos. Amidst treating the victims, Black Jack crosses paths with the infamous Dr. Kiriko, a fellow physician notorious for facilitating his patients' demise in exchange for exorbitant fees. Soon after, both doctors are coerced by the Ghost of Icarus to travel to a secluded island, where they are tasked with curing three patients infected with Satan, an incurable and lethal bacterium.\n\nAs Black Jack grapples with the moral dilemma of treating these patients, he must also contend with the sinister Dr. Kiriko, whose contrasting medical ethics further complicates their situation. With the fate of humanity hanging in the balance, the two doctors are forced to set aside their differences and collaborate to prevent the spread of this deadly disease. As tensions rise and the stakes grow higher, Black Jack and Kiriko find themselves locked in a desperate battle against time, death, and the potential catastrophic consequences that loom over the world.",
