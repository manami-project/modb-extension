  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows a group of high school boys and their humorous daily lives. Centered around students Tadakuni, Hidenori, Yoshitake, and others at an all-boys high school, the story explores their endless debates about idealism, loneliness, morality of pranks, and more. Their silly antics and bonding over universal teenage questions makes their mundane high school experience engaging and relatable. This entry covers previously unaired episodes released later on DVD/BD. While containing the same charm and humor as the main series, these specials offer additional snapshots into the endearing characters and their quirky adventures dealing with zippers, hiccups, and thoughtfulness towards others. Sure to please existing fans, the unaired episodes also serve as a treat for new viewers peeking into the refreshing comedic world depicting the realities of high school boys.",
