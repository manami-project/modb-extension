  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Hybrid Child is an android created by Kuroda, a skilled craftsman. It is neither a machine nor a human, but a unique existence that grows and develops a bond with its owner through their love and care. The stories follow several Hybrid Child models and their owners: Kotarou, a young heir of a noble family, finds an abandoned Hybrid Child named Hazuki and brings him home. Despite resistance from his strict family, Kotarou's dedication leads to Hazuki flourishing over 10 years. However, Kotarou then realizes Hybrid Children have limited lifespans. Seya, a tragic swordsman, is able to open his heart again with the help of his cheerful Hybrid Child Yuzu. Their tale explores moving on from loss through found family. The final story reveals Kuroda was inspired to invent the Hybrid Children after losing his own love. His creation allows others to experience profound bonds through these artificial humans who can feel emotions yet are not mortal. These interconnected stories explore love, loss, responsibility, and what makes us human. Through lavishing the unique Hybrid Children with affection, their owners discover the depth of emotion and connection these beings can reflect back.",
