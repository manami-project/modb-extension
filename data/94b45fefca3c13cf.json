    "text": "Cheat Pharmacist Reiji Kirio, a former corporate slave, finds himself transported to a fantasy world with only two skills: \"Appraise\" and \"Drug Discovery.\" Initially underwhelmed, Reiji soon realizes the potential of his abilities and begins crafting potions that far surpass the quality available in this new world. With his exceptional pharmaceutical knowledge, he quickly amasses a fortune and opens a drugstore, bidding farewell to his dreary corporate life.\n\nReiji's drugstore caters to a diverse clientele, from elves struggling with archery to dragons with unintentional fire-breathing issues. With an array of remedies, from eye drops to cough syrup, Reiji's new life as a pharmacist in this magical world is anything but ordinary. Joined by his loyal canine companion, Noera, and the ethereal Mina, Reiji embraces a slow-paced life, tending to the needs of all who visit his shop.\n\nBased on the light novel series by Kennoji, \"Drugstore in Another World: The Slow Life of a Cheat Pharmacist\" follows Reiji's tranquil yet often hectic days as he navigates the challenges and rewards of running a drugstore in a world filled with mythical creatures and magical ailments.",
