As her 15th birthday approaches, she finds the shard of Manatsu's mirror that she kept safe in her drawer has inexplicably vanished. The very same day, a mysterious girl named Mafuyu, bearing an uncanny resemblance to Manatsu, appears before Ichika with a playful grin.\n\nMonths have passed since the events of \"Uta Kata,\" and the arrival of winter coincides with Ichika's upcoming birthday. Sei is preparing for a semester abroad in Germany, while Ichika grapples with rumors of Manatsu's reappearance. Despite her disbelief, she reunites with Kai for Christmas to bid farewell to Sei. In an unexpected turn of events, this bonus episode reveals a surprising encounter that awaits Ichika.\n\nHalf a year has elapsed since Ichika's unforgettable summer with Manatsu, and the fragment of their shared memories, a broken piece of glass, remains hidden yet cherished in her drawer. As winter break commences and her 15th birthday draws near, Ichika hears tales of Manatsu's sightings around town. Though hesitant to believe them, the discovery of her missing mirror shard on her birthday hints at the possibility of a heartwarming reunion with her dear friend.",
