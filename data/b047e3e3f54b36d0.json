    "text": "It is now winter in Kamakura, marking several months since Ichika's fateful summer with Manatsu. As Ichika's 15th birthday approaches, her friend Satsuki claims to have seen Manatsu in town. Ichika is skeptical, but can't deny her longing to reunite with her dear friend. On the eve of her birthday, the mirror shard gifted by Manatsu mysteriously vanishes from Ichika's desk. That night, a girl named Mafuyu appears, introducing herself as Manatsu's twin. With a playful grin, Mafuyu hints at an exciting reunion between the long-lost friends. With Manatsu's memento gone and signs of her return mounting, Ichika faces the prospect of reconnecting with her magical companion. Could this winter bring back the magical days of summer? Ichika's 15th birthday seems destined to be a memorable one as the possibility of adventure looms.",
