  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so begins the journey of Kotoura Haruka, a 15-year-old girl with an extraordinary ability to read minds. A gift that has been a double-edged sword, leading to her parents' divorce and leaving her alienated from her peers. As she steps into a new high school, Haruka braces herself for more of the same, but destiny has other plans.\n\nEnter Manabe Yoshihisa, a classmate who not only accepts her unique ability but also appreciates it. His unconventional approach to life, tinged with a hint of perversion, makes him an unlikely ally for Haruka. With Manabe's encouragement, Haruka begins to break free from her self-imposed isolation, gradually opening up to her classmates.\n\nAs word of her ability spreads, she finds herself invited to join the Paranormal Society (ESP) club. Led by the effervescent Mifune Yuriko and the level-headed Muroto Daichi, the club members welcome Haruka with open arms. For the first time, Haruka finds herself surrounded by friends who value her for who she is, rather than shunning her for her ability.\n\nAs Haruka navigates through her newfound social life, she learns the value of friendship and the joy of being accepted. With Manabe and her club mates by her side, Haruka embarks on a journey of self-discovery, laughter, and love in this heartwarming school comedy.",
