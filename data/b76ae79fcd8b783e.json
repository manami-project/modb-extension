  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so begins the extraordinary tale of Hazumu, a gentle and reserved young man with a deep affection for flora and a heart yearning for the affection of the captivating Yasuna. When his confession of love is met with rejection, Hazumu seeks solace in the familiar embrace of Mt. Kashimayama, a place where memories of Yasuna still linger.\n\nAs twilight descends and the path becomes a labyrinth, Hazumu's sorrowful journey takes an unexpected turn when a celestial spectacle catches his eye. Little does he know that the falling star he beholds is, in fact, an alien spacecraft on a collision course with Earth. The impact leaves Hazumu's life hanging in the balance, but the extraterrestrial beings aboard the ship possess the technology to restore him.\n\nHowever, this second chance at life comes with an unforeseen twist: Hazumu is resurrected not as the boy he once was, but as a girl. As she navigates the complexities of her new identity, Hazumu must confront the shifting dynamics of her relationships and find her place in a world that has suddenly become both familiar and strange.",
