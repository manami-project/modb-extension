  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shiokaze elementary student, Tsuyoshi Takahashi, is a young boy with a singular focus on academic excellence, often neglecting his peers and their needs. However, his life takes a dramatic turn on January 17, 1995, when the devastating Kobe / Hyogoken-Nanbu Earthquake strikes, claiming over 6,000 lives and leaving 300,000 people homeless. As Tsuyoshi and his family escape their destroyed home and seek refuge in his school, he witnesses the hardships of communal living and the selflessness of volunteers.\n\nIn the wake of this catastrophic event, Tsuyoshi's perspective shifts as he grapples with personal loss and helps his sickly classmate, Kazu, cope with his own tragedy. Amidst the ruins of their community, Tsuyoshi and his fellow students discover a resilient spirit among the survivors, who, despite their fear and despair, unite to rebuild their lives. This powerful anime, inspired by the real-life Great Hanshin earthquake, follows Tsuyoshi's transformation from a self-centered student to a compassionate individual who learns to appreciate the people around him.",
