    "text": "Fair weather or foul, the Seioh Student Council is determined to make the most of their summer break! Before diving into the planning of the School Fair, the girls embark on a mission to gather funds for a special camping trip. Working together to clean a swimming pool, they find themselves delightfully sidetracked by summertime chatter, refreshing beverages, and lively water pistol skirmishes.\n\nDespite the blazing heat and the looming threat of a typhoon, the council manages to collect enough money for their outdoor escapade. However, Mother Nature has other plans, as heavy rain forces them to abandon their original itinerary. Undeterred, the friends adapt to the situation and seek refuge in a nearby rural hotel, proving that the true essence of a memorable summer lies not in the destination, but in the company they keep.\n\nSet between the events of episodes six and seven, this episode showcases the unbreakable bond among the Student Council members, as they turn an unexpected setback into an unforgettable summer adventure.",
