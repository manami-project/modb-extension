  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sumire Suo is a talented middle school soccer player who struggles to reach her full potential due to her unskilled teammates holding her back. As she prepares to enter high school, her rival Midori Soshizaki extends an offer for them to attend the same school and play on the same soccer team together. Soshizaki promises that by joining forces, Suo will finally be able to showcase her exceptional skills instead of having to \"play alone.\" Meanwhile, Nozomi Onda is a skilled soccer player who has excelled at the sport since childhood, even playing alongside boys. However, upon entering middle school she faces obstacles due to gender barriers in the sport. Undeterred, Onda aims to break through these barriers and cement her status as a soccer star. As fate would have it, Onda and Suo both end up attending Warabi Seinan High School and joining the girls' soccer team. Surrounded at last by teammates who can keep up with their abilities, the stage is set for both girls to unleash their full potential on the field. Alongside their diverse and talented teammates, Onda and Suo set out to lead the team to victory - and perhaps also pave the way for a resurgence of women's soccer in Japan.",
