  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Paint it, White, the movie, takes us on a thrilling journey as Earth is under siege by the Pictorians, a peculiar alien race hailing from the distant planet Pict. The Pictorians are armed with a unique weapon that drains the color from everything it touches, transforming humans into featureless, white-skinned beings known as Noppera.\n\nAs the world teeters on the brink of becoming a monochromatic wasteland, the nations of Hetalia must join forces to combat this extraterrestrial menace. Initially, the Allied and Axis powers attempt to repel the invasion independently, but their efforts prove futile. Realizing the urgency of the situation, they decide to put aside their differences and unite to save humanity from the Pictorians' rainbow-beam-thingy.\n\nWith America taking charge, the united nations of Hetalia devise a plan to infiltrate the alien mothership and discover the Pictorians' weakness. As they embark on this daring mission, they must overcome their individual shortcomings and work together to restore color to their world and prevent the extinction of mankind. Will they succeed in their quest to save Earth and 'Paint it, White' with the colors of victory? Only time will tell.",
