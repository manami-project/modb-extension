  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the struggles of cells working tirelessly to maintain an unhealthy human body. A rookie Red Blood Cell frantically delivers oxygen, but faces immense challenges as he navigates blood vessels clogged with cholesterol. Meanwhile, stress hormones yell urgently, pushing cells to their limits. The body suffers from a litany of issues like drinking, smoking, ulcers, erectile dysfunction, and sleep deprivation. It's in a perpetual state of \"Code Black\" emergency. Our Red Blood Cell protagonist is joined by a White Blood Cell partner as they confront threats ranging from liver disease to athlete's foot. Despite the cells' best efforts, the human persists in poor lifestyle choices that jeopardize his health. The cells persevere through literal body horror, never getting a break. Yet they soldier on, dedicated to their duty even as death claims many of their comrades. Will the cells' sacrifice be enough to save their self-destructive human? Find out in this spin-off that presents an adult twist on its popular predecessor about the inner workings of the human body.",
