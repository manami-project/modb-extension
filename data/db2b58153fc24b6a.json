    "text": "DVD/Blu-ray bonus feature, \"Saezuru Doubutsu wa Yarushikanai!\" is a charming, parody mini-anime that reimagines the characters of \"Twittering Birds Never Fly\" as adorable pets. The series, which includes 25 previously released Twitter episodes and 5 brand-new ones, sees Doumeki transformed into a lovable dog and Yashiro as an endearing kitten. This delightful spin-off serves as a whimsical promotion for the film \"Saezuru Tori wa Habatakanai: The Clouds Gather\".",
