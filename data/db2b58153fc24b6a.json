  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Saezuru Doubutsu wa Yarushikanai! is a short, lighthearted mini-anime based on the more serious work, Saezuru Tori wa Habatakanai (Twittering Birds Never Fly). Made to promote the film adaptation Saezuru Tori wa Habatakanai: The Clouds Gather, it features chibi versions of the main characters transformed into cute animals - the stern Doumeki becomes an adorable dog while the standoffish Yashiro turns into a mischievous kitten. Originally released as 25 short episodes on Twitter to generate buzz for the movie, the mini-anime anthology has now been collected along with 5 additional new episodes and released on DVD/Blu-ray as a fun extra for fans. With its parody take on the franchise's dark themes and tense romantic relationships, Saezuru Doubutsu wa Yarushikanai! serves both to promote the main work and provide some amusingly irreverent, lighthearted content for audiences to enjoy.",
