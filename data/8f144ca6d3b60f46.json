    "text": "Set in the summer of 2026 at the Fuji Training Facility, the story follows Natori Touko and her classmates at the Eastern Private Defense Academy. As third-year middle school students, they are undergoing intense field training under instructor Kamiya in preparation for graduation. On the last day of training, Kamiya proposes an extracurricular class called Newest Weapons Research to further hone an exceptional group of students. However, their training is suddenly interrupted when an unknown force launches a brutal attack on the facility. With their lives at risk, Touko and her seven heavily-armed classmates find themselves fighting for survival in a bloody battle. Though just teenagers, their specialized training is put to the ultimate test as they use cutting-edge weaponry and tactics to try and overcome the assault. Will Touko's leadership and the students' advanced preparation be enough for them to make it out alive? Or will the mystery attackers, who seem intent on mass destruction, prevail and turn the training ground into a graveyard?",
