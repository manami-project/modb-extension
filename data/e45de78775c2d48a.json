    "text": "Yashiro's after-school hours are anything but ordinary, as she assists the ghostly Hanako-kun in maintaining the delicate balance between the human and supernatural realms of Kamome Academy. Together, they investigate the school's many mysteries, but when the bell rings and the school day ends, the real fun begins. From cleaning toilets to playing cards, swapping genders to holding auditions for the school's Seven Mysteries, Hanako and Yashiro's laid-back afternoons are filled with mischief and antics that involve both the living and the dead. Come and see what the characters of Toilet-bound Hanako-kun get up to when they're not busy solving supernatural cases!",
