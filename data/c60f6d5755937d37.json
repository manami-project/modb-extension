  "synopsis": {
    "text": "You're in for a wild ride with Kouichi Mizuki, a high school basketball star who finds himself in an unexpected predicament after his last game. While reminiscing about his crush and teammates, he's suddenly whisked away to a world of giants called Eustil. The summoner, Prince Caius of Tildant, has a peculiar request: he wants Kouichi to be his bride and fulfill an ancient prophecy.\n\nDespite the shock and a considerable size difference, Kouichi agrees to stay for a month, hoping to find a way back home. However, the more time he spends in this new world, the more he adapts to being a 'dwarf' among giants. As Caius lavishes attention on him, Kouichi discovers unimaginable pleasure, even though he initially fears the prince's advances.\n\nThe prophecy dictates that Caius must marry someone from another world to prevent a terrible fate from befalling Tildant. With Kouichi as the potential key to saving the kingdom, will he decide to stay permanently or return to his mundane life? This unique tale of love, prophecy, and self-discovery will keep you on the edge of your seat.",
