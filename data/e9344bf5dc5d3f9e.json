  "synopsis": {
    "text": "What begins as an ordinary day in a serene Tokyo neighborhood, transforms into an extraordinary adventure for seven alienated teenagers. Upon discovering their glowing bedroom mirrors, they are transported from their isolated lives into a mesmerizing castle brimming with enchanting chandeliers and labyrinthine staircases. The castle, reminiscent of a Grimm's fairy tale, becomes their haven and playground, but it also presents them with a perplexing challenge: find the hidden key that grants a single wish before the school year ends. However, they must adhere to a strict rule: depart by five o'clock or face dire consequences.\n\nAs the clock ticks, a harrowing reality surfaces: only those who dare to reveal their deepest secrets will find salvation. Among them is Kokoro, a reserved and friendless student, who must now collaborate with her fellow students to unravel the cryptic connection that binds them together. Guided by a mysterious girl donning a wolf mask, they embark on a journey to uncover each other's storiesâ€”tales of unrequited love, familial neglect, and chilling fear.\n\nAs they navigate through the trials and tribulations of the game, a poignant narrative unfurls, depicting seven individuals entangled in a web of loneliness and misunderstanding. Ultimately, the power of empathy, friendship, and sacrifice illuminates their path to liberation.",
