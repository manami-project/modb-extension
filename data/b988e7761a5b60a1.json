  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's been a few months since the harrowing events of the \"New Generation Madness\" incident and the aftermath of the Shibuya earthquake, which brought about the Chaos Child Syndrome. In the anime Silent Sky, we delve into the future, three months ahead, to uncover what unfolds next for the central characters.\n\nSilent Sky serves as the final chapter in the series, revealing the subsequent journey of the 'boy' and 'girl.' The narrative revolves around Serika, who has been recreated by Takuru's abilities, resulting in her having no recollection of her past life. Believing she lost her memory due to an accident, Serika now resides in Yokohama, leaving her past life in Shibuya behind. She embraces her new life with happiness, yet every night, she is plagued by dreams from her past, hinting at something or someone significant she has forgotten.",
