    "text": "Haran Banjo, a young and brave protagonist, finds himself as humanity's last hope against the malevolent Meganoids, a group of rogue cyborgs intent on transforming humans into machines. Originated from the brilliant mind of scientist Sozo Haran, these self-thinking cyborgs turned against their creator, leading to the tragic demise of Dr. Haran and his family on Mars. Fortunately, the youngest son, Banjou, managed to escape the massacre, fleeing to Earth with a powerful, solar-powered robot named Daitarn 3, crafted from unique Martian metals.\n\nNow, at the age of 18, Banjou resides in a lavish mansion, accompanied by his loyal butler, Garrison, and two striking allies, Reika Sanjo, an ex-Interpol agent, and Beauty Tachibana, his childhood friend. As a team, they confront the relentless Meganoids, who are hell-bent on \"improving\" the human race by converting them into cyborgs. With Daitarn 3's transformative abilities and Banjou's unwavering determination, they embark on thrilling adventures to protect Earth and vanquish the sinister invaders.",
