    "text": "It's spring at the prestigious Kimberly Magic Academy, and a new batch of first-year students have arrived, eager to begin their magical training. Among them are Oliver Horn, a talented young mage skilled with both wand and blade, and Nanao Hibiya, a headstrong samurai girl from a distant land. Though from very different backgrounds, fate brings Oliver and Nanao together, and they soon become friends and rivals. However, Kimberly Academy harbors many sinister secrets and dangers. As Oliver and Nanao uncover the school's dark mysteries, they realize surviving their first year will take all their wits, courage, and no small amount of magic. Supported by their newfound companionship, these two young spellblades must band together if they hope to graduate from this treacherous academy alive. Beset by trolls, deadly creatures, and bloodthirsty enemies around every corner, Oliver and Nanao have their work cut out for them. But with powerful magic, sharp blades, quick thinking, and an unbreakable bond, they just might live to see the end of their first year at Kimberly Magic Academy.",
