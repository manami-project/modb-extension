  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime, 'Tsuki ni Naku', presents a captivating blend of relaxation and suspense in its storyline, drawing content from the 11th volume of its manga source. The narrative unfolds as members of the Hiizumi Life Counselling Office embark on a tranquil retreat to a mountain onsen, while back in Sakura Shimachi, the local police grapple with an emerging threat from a formidable youkai hunter. Simultaneously, the serenity of Hime, Akina, and their companions' mountain getaway is shattered when a werewolf half yokai, Rokkaku, abducts Kana, one of the Tatebayashi twins. Rokkaku's sinister intentions revolve around consuming Kana's mermaid blood to harness her power. Amidst this chaos, Shidou, Kana and Mina's adoptive father, must confront Rokkaku's overwhelming strength to rescue his beloved family. The OVA is bundled with the limited edition of the manga (14th, 15th, and 16th), and also narrates the tale of the land god Yuuhi's encounter with his companion, Mariabelle.",
