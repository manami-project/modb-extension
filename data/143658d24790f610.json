    "text": "AT's, or Air Trecks, are the latest trend in extreme sports, offering thrill-seekers the chance to perform gravity-defying stunts and race at breakneck speeds. For Ikki, a middle school student with a penchant for trouble, these high-tech rollerblades are an irresistible allure. After a run-in with a group of Storm Riders, skilled AT users who push the limits of the sport, Ikki stumbles upon a hidden pair of Air Trecks and a collection of stickers belonging to the notorious Sleeping Forest gang. Ignoring the warnings of his four older sisters, Ikki takes to the streets, determined to master the art of Air Trecking and make a name for himself in this dangerous underground world. As he forms his own gang and competes in high-stakes battles against rival teams, Ikki finds himself drawn to Simca, a skilled and enigmatic rider who always seems to be one step ahead. With the police hot on their heels and the stakes getting higher with each race, Ikki and his friends must push themselves to the limit in order to claim victory and rule the skies.",
