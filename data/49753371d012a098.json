After witnessing a hit and run, she transforms into 'Maria,' a bespectacled, long-haired persona to escape the clutches of danger. Caught in a love triangle with her classmate Shuu and her neighbor Kadomatsu, an aspiring boxer, Minatsu navigates through the joys and heartaches of young love. But there's a twist: Kadomatsu's heart yearns not for Minatsu, but for her alter ego, Maria.
