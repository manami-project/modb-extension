    "text": "Nozas, a formidable alien race, have set their sights on Planet Maris, a thriving human colony known as the Second Earth, in the year 2387. Their objective is to exterminate all human life to pave the way for their own reproduction cycle. Amidst this dire situation, hope emerges in the form of three extraordinary firearms known as the Zillion Weapon System, remnants of an ancient civilization. Powered by a unique energy source called Zillium, these weapons are capable of obliterating even heavily armored Nozas. Three brave teenagers - JJ, Champ, and Apple - are chosen to wield these powerful weapons and lead the charge against the alien invaders as the White Knights. Can they harness the power of the Zillion guns and save humanity from the brink of extinction?",
