    "text": "Holy Lord Yuanming and the enchanting concubine Bao Si wield sinister influence over King You of Zhou, leading him to construct the God Creation Tower during the declining years of the Western Zhou Dynasty. This ominous tower unleashes demonic energy, plaguing the land and its inhabitants. To thwart this catastrophe, a young warrior named Han Ji is dispatched by his master to vanquish the demons and overthrow the tyrannical king.\n\nHan Ji's journey is fraught with challenges, as he finds himself entangled with a mysterious woman named Zhan, who possesses the ancient bloodline capable of stabilizing the world. Despite her noble intentions, Zhan is ensnared in traps set by malevolent forces. In a fateful turn of events, Han Ji sacrifices his life to protect Zhan, forging an unbreakable bond between them.\n\nAs the world descends further into chaos, ghosts, gods, immortals, and spiritual beasts roam unchecked. Amidst this turmoil, Han Ji's singular goal remains: to overthrow the tyranny and restore peace to the land. The fate of the world hangs in the balance, as the prophetic song of a dynasty's destruction echoes through the ages: \"The moon will rise and the sun will set. Mulberry bow skip bag is going to destroy the state of Zhou.\" Will Han Ji and his allies succeed in their perilous quest, or will they succumb to the darkness that threatens to consume them?",
