  "synopsis": {
    "text": "T≈çhoku's secluded mountains hide a peculiar Shinto shrine, home to Machi, a young middle school student and shrine maiden. The shrine's unique enshrinement? A talking bear named Natsu, who acts as Machi's guardian. Having spent her entire life in the tranquil mountains, Machi yearns for a change of scenery and expresses her desire to attend a city school. Overprotective Natsu, fearing Machi's naivety about urban life, devises a series of trials to ensure her preparedness. Will Natsu's unconventional tests equip Machi for the challenges of city life, or will they prove to be a comedic overreaction? Only time will tell as Machi embarks on her journey towards a new world.",
