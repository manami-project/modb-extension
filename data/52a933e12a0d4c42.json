    "text": "After going through immense personal hardships, Makoto finds himself slowly regaining his sense of self and ability to connect with others. He forms strong bonds with his comrades in the Specialized Extracurricular Execution Squad (SEES), a group dedicated to defeating dangerous monsters called Shadows that appear during the mysterious Dark Hour period. As Makoto adjusts to his new life with SEES, new threats emerge - a rogue group of Persona users called Strega, who wish to preserve the Dark Hour for their own benefit, as well as questions around the nature of Makoto's deep connection with Aegis, an amnesiac android. While conflicts continue and mysteries remain regarding the Dark Hour and Makoto's fate, his relationships with SEES give him stability and hope. However, ominous signs emerge that the peace he has found may be disrupted once more. Though the battle rages on and uncertainties loom, Makoto chooses to treasure each moment with his comrades, wishing that their bonds remain unbroken in the days ahead, whatever challenges are yet to come.",
