  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Oda Nobunaga, a carefree heir to the Eastern Planet of Owari, is deemed a fool by his peers and family alike. Meanwhile, Jeanne Kaguya d'Arc, a girl from the Western Planet, is guided by divine visions of a 'Savior-King' who can save their war-torn realms. Accompanied by the insightful Leonardo da Vinci, Jeanne embarks on a journey to the East in search of this prophesized leader. As the two planets, once connected by the celestial chain known as the Dragon Stream, now only share a bond of endless conflict, the reemergence of powerful ancient technology, known as 'sacred treasures,' could reshape the world order. When Jeanne and Leonardo cross paths with Nobunaga, they find themselves caught in the crossfire of a brutal war. Despite his seemingly lackadaisical demeanor, Jeanne begins to suspect that Nobunaga might be the 'Star Messiah' she's been seeking. As the fate of two worlds hangs in the balance, Nobunaga, Jeanne, and their allies must unite to overcome adversity and restore harmony to their fractured universe.",
