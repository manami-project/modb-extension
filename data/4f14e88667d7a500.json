    "text": "The life of an ordinary Japanese high school student, Samy Yoshino, takes an unexpected turn when she inadvertently gets entangled in a biker gang's altercation. Fleeing the scene with the aid of a boy and her loyal dog, Samy finds herself catapulted across dimensions, landing in a realm beyond time and space. In this unfamiliar world, she encounters a witch in need of assistance, further entwining her fate with this strange place.\n\nUnbeknownst to Samy, she harbors immense cosmic powers that catch the attention of both divine beings striving to preserve the universe and malevolent demons hellbent on its destruction. Led by the formidable Noa, these dark forces will stop at nothing to quell Samy's newfound abilities.\n\nAs the battle between good and evil unfolds on a cosmic scale, Samy and her friends find themselves on the frontlines, armed with an arsenal of swords, sorcery, and cybernetic battle suits. Can Samy harness her extraordinary powers and tip the balance in favor of the divine, or will the universe succumb to the sinister plans of Noa and his demonic cohorts? Join Samy on her epic journey as she navigates the treacherous path between adolescence and cosmic warfare, where the fate of the universe rests in the hands of an unsuspecting high school student.",
