    "text": "In the bustling world of modern Japan, heartbroken college student Kazuya Kinoshita resorts to an unconventional solution to mend his shattered heart - renting a girlfriend through an online app. His first date with the stunning Chizuru Mizuhara appears to be perfect, as she embodies the ideal blend of beauty and charm. However, skeptical Kazuya questions her authenticity after reading conflicting reviews about her, leading him to leave a negative rating.\n\nInfuriated by his audacity, Chizuru reveals her true feisty and hot-headed personality, far from the sweet demeanor she initially displayed. Their heated exchange is abruptly halted when Kazuya learns of his grandmother's sudden collapse. Accompanying him to the hospital, Chizuru reluctantly plays the part of the devoted girlfriend upon meeting his ecstatic grandmother, who has long wished for Kazuya to find love.\n\nAs fate would have it, Kazuya and Chizuru's lives become increasingly intertwined, with unexpected connections between their universities and even their grandmothers. Struggling to maintain this charade, Kazuya remains entangled in his past relationship while Chizuru strives to keep her secret life hidden. Will these two unlikely companions navigate the complexities of their fake relationship, or will their hearts become entangled in a web of emotions?",
