    "text": "Hodaka is a high school student who leaves his isolated island home and moves to rainy Tokyo, struggling financially and living in isolation. He finds work writing for an occult magazine and crosses paths with Hina, an orphaned girl caring for her younger brother. Despite their hardship, Hina and her brother have a cheerful life. She has a magical gift - the ability to stop the constant rain and summon sunshine. As Hodaka gets to know Hina, he sees the potential in her powers to bring clear skies to rain-drenched Tokyo. He suggests she become a \"sunshine girl,\" using her gift to help people. At first, Hina's sunshine powers seem like a blessing for the dreary city. But interfering with nature's laws comes at a price. As Hina and Hodaka grow closer, dark clouds loom over their sunny lives. They soon face difficult choices about using Hina's gift and the consequences it brings. This poignant anime drama follows two struggling youths whose fates intertwine when one discovers she has the supernatural ability to manipulate the weather. It explores the high cost of magic in the rain-soaked streets of Tokyo.",
