  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hina Tsurugi has recently moved to a seaside town with her family. As an introverted person who enjoys indoor activities, she struggles to adjust to her new surroundings. While walking along the embankment one day, Hina encounters her energetic classmate Yuuki Kuroiwa, who convinces her to join a unique school club called the Breakwater Fishing Club. Though initially hesitant due to her fear of sea creatures, Hina decides to give fishing a try. She joins Yuuki and two other eccentric club members in their regular activities - catching and cooking various types of fish and seafood from the ocean. Over time, Hina gradually begins to appreciate the relaxing joy of fishing, as well as the delightful community she has become a part of. With her new friends by her side, she slowly comes out of her shell and starts looking forward to her after-school club adventures along the breakwater.",
