  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Summer vacation begins, bringing both adventure and romance for a group of friends. Norimichi and his pals are curious to see if fireworks look round or flat when viewed from the side, so they hatch a plan to find out using the vantage point of the town lighthouse during the big annual fireworks festival. Meanwhile, Norimichi finds himself conflicted when his classmate and crush, Nazuna, suddenly asks him to run away with her to escape her unhappy home situation. As events unfold, a glowing orb with mysterious powers offers the chance to hit reset whenever things go wrong, allowing the pair repeated chances at staying together - even as the resets take them farther from reality. With humor and heart, this charming anime follows a group of friends over the course of a strange supernatural summer day filled with hijinks, young romance, and a touch of magic.",
