    "text": "Nazuna's world is about to change forever as her mother decides to remarry, pushing her to contemplate running away from home. Meanwhile, Norimichi and his friends are on a mission to solve an age-old debate: do fireworks appear round or flat when viewed from the side? As they embark on a quest to find the perfect vantage point at the town's lighthouse during the Moshimo Festival, Norimichi's life takes an unexpected turn when Nazuna invites him to join her on her journey.\n\nHowever, things don't go as planned, and the pair finds themselves caught in a loop of strange events triggered by a mysterious, multi-colored orb in Nazuna's possession. With each attempt to reset their fate, the two are drawn further away from reality, forcing them to confront the consequences of their actions and the true essence of their bond. As Norimichi and Nazuna navigate through this enigmatic world, they must come to terms with their feelings and decide if they're willing to risk everything to be together.",
