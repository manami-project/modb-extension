  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows Mia, a girl with a mischievous streak, who finds herself in an unexpected adventure when she is given a book titled \"Thumbelina.\" As she delves into the pages, she is magically pulled into the narrative, shrinking in size and finding herself trapped in a dreamlike realm. A fairy ruler informs her that the only way to return to her own world is to embark on a quest to find a mystical crystal. Along her journey, Mia forms new friendships and learns valuable lessons that help her grow as a person. The fate of her return to her mother and the normal world remains uncertain. This captivating tale was adapted into an 80-minute film, initially released on VHS by Starmaker Entertainment in North America in 1993, and later re-released on DVD by Digiview Entertainment in 2006.",
