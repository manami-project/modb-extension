    "text": "While most professionals strive to maintain a polished image, Mai Waku, a captivating supernatural troubleshooter, frequently finds herself in unexpectedly revealing situations. As the owner of a consulting agency that specializes in paranormal and ecchi issues, Mai's irresistible allure often leads to clothing mishaps during her cases. From assisting high-profile celebrities to humble innkeepers, Mai's unique approach to problem-solving leaves her clients both satisfied and slightly flustered.\n\nIn her latest assignment, Mai is tasked with locating the elusive Dr. Shinobi, the only hope for a desperate family seeking to save their daughter. Fortunately, the dashing doctor is no stranger to Mai's unconventional methods and is always ready to lend a hand. With a diverse clientele that includes a nudity-allergic musical idol, a sexually-frustrated demon, and a perverted reflexology practitioner, Mai's voluptuous charm becomes her most powerful tool in overcoming obstacles and achieving success. No matter how bizarre the case, Mai's determination and unique abilities make her the last hope for those in need.",
