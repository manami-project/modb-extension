  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During the early 20th century, scientists combined technological advancements with sophisticated magic to develop \"Machinart\" - circuits made of spells that could bring objects to life. Machinart was created as a military weapon and spread globally. Protagonist Akabane Raishin attends the prestigious Walpurgis Royal Academy of Machinart to become the world's greatest puppeteer. He is accompanied by Yaya, his teenage automaton weapon. Despite Raishin's top-tier combat skills, he scores nearly last on the entrance exams. To prove his worth, he must defeat the deadliest students in a tournament where the winner is crowned \"Wiseman\" and gains access to forbidden Machinart arts. Driven by past tragedies, Raishin fights alongside Yaya against all odds to claim the Wiseman title and realize his dream.",
