    "text": "Yama no Susume is an anime that follows a group of high school girls who enjoy mountain climbing together. In an unaired bonus episode, the girls have a lighthearted debate about bras in the locker room, feeling that Kaede's sports bra is not cute enough. Wanting to bring some more femininity into her wardrobe, they take a trip to go bra shopping at a fashion store in Ikebukuro. This shopping excursion takes place in the timeline between episodes 6 and 7 of the second season. The second bonus episode provides a recap of the highlights from season two in the format of a fictional TV show hosted by Aoi and Hinata. They count down their picks for the top 10 best and most memorable scenes from throughout the season. While reminiscing about these moments, some of the events appear slightly different than how they actually transpired. Nonetheless, this episode serves as a fun review for fans while also potentially attracting new viewers. Overall, Yama no Susume offers slices of life friendship and comedy with the backdrop of mountain climbing excursions. These extra episodes provide additional humor and bonding time for the energetic cast of characters. Fans are sure to enjoy the lighthearted girl talk and recap of the series' most amusing scenes.",
