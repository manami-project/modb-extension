  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hinata and Aoi take the lead in a special episode that falls between the sixth and seventh episodes of the second season, focusing on a topic of great importance to teenage girls - the perfect bra. Kaede's sports bra is deemed not cute enough by her friends, leading to a shopping trip to Ikebukuro to add a touch of femininity to her wardrobe. In another unaired episode, the girls take a trip down memory lane, revisiting their top 10 favorite moments from the series, but with a twist - some events may not be exactly as they remember. This special episode is included in the BD and DVD of volume 2, released on October 24, 2014. In \"Bura no Susume?\", Yuuka Sasahara encourages Kaede Saitou to expand her undergarment collection beyond just sports bras. Despite not understanding the allure of flashy clothing, Kaede finds herself shopping with Aoi Yukimura, Hinata Kuraue, and Kokona Aoba, proving that even shopping can be a challenging climb.",
