  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As a young and curious witch, Yadamon finds herself exiled from her home in the Witch Forest by her mother, the Queen, after causing a ruckus. The Queen's secret fascination with human literature and magazines may have played a part in this decision. Now, Yadamon must navigate the technologically advanced human world, where she finds a new home with the handsome Jean, his biologist mother Maria, and his father Eddie.\n\nLiving on Creature Island, a place dedicated to the genetic recreation of extinct species, Yadamon's inquisitive nature often leads her into a series of amusing misadventures. Her magical abilities, still in their developmental stages, often cause trouble for the humans around her and her time-stopping guardian fairy, Taimon.\n\nHowever, the fun and games are overshadowed by an imminent threat. Kira, an evil witch once sealed away by the Queen and the great witch Beril, has broken free from her volcanic prison. With vengeance in her heart, Kira sets her sights on both the humans and Yadamon. As Yadamon continues to learn and adapt to her new environment, she must also prepare to face this new danger.",
