    "text": "Ricoâ€™s life takes a dramatic turn when he is catapulted from the 1980s into the futuristic world of 2050, following a high-speed car chase. Now known as Ryu Urashima, he finds himself in a Tokyo unrecognizable from his past, filled with advanced technology and zero-gravity discos. But the time jump has left him with no memories of his past life, and he must navigate this new world as a member of Neo Tokyo's Mobile Police Unit. Alongside his cynical partner Claude and the enigmatic Sophia, Ryu uses his newfound superhuman abilities to combat the ruthless crime syndicate Necrime. As he fights for justice in this unfamiliar world, Ryu must also unravel the mystery of his past and find a way back home. With his unique approach to solving cases and his formidable fighting spirit, Ryu proves to be an invaluable asset to the police force and a force to be reckoned with by Necrime.",
