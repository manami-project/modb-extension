  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In feudal Japan, a young Emishi prince named Ashitaka is forced to kill a demon-possessed boar that attacks his village. Though he saves the village, Ashitaka is cursed by the dying boar. To find a cure and prevent the curse from consuming him, Ashitaka journeys west. He arrives in Tatara, an iron mining town led by Lady Eboshi that is clearing the surrounding forests. This deforestation angers the animal gods and spirits of the forest, who seek revenge under the leadership of San, a human girl raised by wolves. Ashitaka finds Tatara consumed by war between the people of Iron Town and the forest gods. Caught in the middle, Ashitaka attempts to make peace between humankind and the forest spirits, befriending San in the process. However, the deep hatred on both sides makes mediation difficult. Ashitaka perseveres, hoping to curb further destruction of the forest while also saving his own life from the demon's curse. Ultimately, the fate of both mankind and the forest lies in finding a way for technology and nature to coexist in harmony rather than opposition.",
