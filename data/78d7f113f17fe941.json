The restaurant's ghostly maitre d' sets the stage for three spine-tingling stories in each episode, each one a different course in this thrilling feast.\n\nNew to town, Shou joins Ako, affectionately known as Anko, and their friend Reiko in their sixth-grade class at Yamazakura Elementary.

Join Shou, Ako, and Reiko as they navigate the spooky side of life, armed with curiosity and unyielding camaraderie. Delve into the eerie world of Restaurant Kaidan, where every dish tells a tale.",
