  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime presents a whimsical romantic tale featuring a kitten, Loup, and a puppy, Noix, who share an unusual belief: they consider themselves to be human girls. This nonsensical yet endearing narrative serves as a special ending sequence for the 'Anime Seijin: Tokimeki Recipe' cooking and talk show. The story of Loup and Noix, also known as RÅ« and Nowa, unfolds in a delightful and captivating manner, providing a unique blend of fantasy and romance that leaves viewers questioning the boundaries of reality and imagination.",
