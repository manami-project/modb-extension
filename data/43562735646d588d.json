  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ever since childhood, Jun has been close friends with the twin sisters Ryuumi and Naori, his neighbors. Ryuumi has a tomboyish exterior but a feminine interior, while Naori is girly and an avid anime fan. Jun starts dating the elder twin Ryuumi and is happy in the relationship. However, Ryuumi inexplicably breaks up with him and urges him to date Naori instead, who seems to reciprocate his feelings. Heartbroken, Jun struggles to move on from his ex-girlfriend and understand her motives. Did Ryuumi's love for him fade, or is there another reason she ended their romance so suddenly? As Jun grieves the end of his first relationship, his bond with both sisters is tested by complicated emotions. Though different in personality, the twins share an unbreakable connection - one that now ensnares the hapless Jun in a painful love triangle.",
