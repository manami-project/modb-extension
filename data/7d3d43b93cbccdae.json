  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shousuke Kurakane's manga-inspired anime introduces us to Princess Anmitsu, a lively tomboy residing in Amakara Castle during Japan's 17th-century samurai era. Despite the era's traditional setting, Anmitsu's life is far from ordinary, as she encounters modern technology like cars and gadgets, and even witnesses a UFO!\n\nAs Anmitsu turns ten, her parents gift her a tutor, Castella, from the Pudding Kingdom, hoping to encourage her academic pursuits. However, Anmitsu's adventurous spirit often leads her away from her lessons and into the world outside the castle. Along her escapades, she befriends a group of commoner children who make their living through pickpocketing, and their leader, Senbe, captures her heart.\n\nAt 16, Anmitsu's life takes an unexpected turn when she discovers her new friends planning to steal treasures from her own castle. Caught between her loyalty to her friends and her royal duties, Anmitsu must find a way to thwart their plans without revealing her true identity.\n\nAnmitsu's cheerful disposition and adventurous nature make her a beloved figure among her servants and townsfolk, who often find themselves caught up in her exciting escapades. Join Anmitsu as she navigates her unique world filled with modern marvels, first love, and endless mischief.",
