  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Straw Hat Pirates reunite with their old rivals the Foxy Pirates in the New World on a mysterious fog-shrouded island called Nebulandia. The fog renders all devil fruit abilities useless, putting the Straw Hats who rely on those powers at a disadvantage. Foxy returns with three new crew members - Dojaku, Kansho, and the tactical genius Komei. These additions seem to give Foxy an edge over the Straw Hats in a rematch on the neutral territory of Nebulandia. Without access to many of their trademark techniques, Luffy and his crew face a tough challenge. Do they have what it takes to overcome Foxy's tricks and subordinates without their devil fruit abilities? The stakes are high as the pirates clash once more on this strange island.",
