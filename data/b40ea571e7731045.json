  "synopsis": {
    "text": "John Doe and his crew of 12, along with a feline companion, embark on a mission aboard the Saldes in the year 2264. Their destination: a newly discovered planet, 20 years away. Thanks to the Deep Sleep Capsules, they will age only a year during the voyage. However, their seemingly straightforward exploratory mission quickly turns into a living nightmare. Upon awakening from their stasis, they discover that two among them are not who they seem. As the crew grapples with this revelation, an unknown force begins to claim their lives one by one, and the ship itself appears to be turning against them. With the bodies of their fallen crewmates mysteriously vanishing, the remaining members must uncover the truth and fight for survival in the cold, unforgiving depths of space, all while knowing that help is 20 years away. This gripping tale draws inspiration from the cinematic masterpieces Alien and The Thing.",
