    "text": "When 35-year-old novelist Makio Koudai loses her sister Minori and brother-in-law in a tragic car accident, she decides to take in her 15-year-old niece Asa Takumi, who is left orphaned. Though Makio and Minori did not have a close relationship, Makio wants to support Asa during this difficult time. Asa struggles to process her grief after the sudden loss of her parents. Feeling overwhelmed and lost, Asa questions her identity and place in the world. In an effort to help Asa, Makio suggests that she start writing in a diary as an emotional outlet. Despite Makio's lack of experience with children, she becomes Asa's guardian so that the teenager has a place to call home. Now these two virtual strangers must learn to adjust to life together under one roof. Makio attempts to provide guidance to her niece, while also giving Asa the freedom to figure herself out. In turn, Asa's presence pushes Makio out of her comfort zone. United by grief, Makio and Asa slowly bond through their shared awkwardness and attempts to understand one another. Their unlikely partnership leads them on a journey of growth, where they discover more about themselves and what it means to be family.",
