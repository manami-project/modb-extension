  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tanaka Taichi, the chronically late badminton player, Okita Sawa, the archer with dreams of becoming a jockey, Miyamoto Konatsu, the optimistic singer, Maeda Atsuhiro, the Austrian transfer student, and Sakai Wakana, the former music student haunted by tragedy, are all brought together in their final year at Shirahamazaka High School by a common thread: music. As the school prepares for its annual recital, Konatsu is determined to participate, despite being banned from performing as a soloist after a disastrous performance the previous year. In an attempt to fulfill her dream, she sets out to form a singing club, but finds it harder than expected to recruit members. With time running out, Konatsu must convince her friends to join her and overcome their own personal struggles in order to perform at the recital and make their last summer of high school one to remember. Through the power of music, these five teenagers learn to face their fears, chase their dreams, and find their place in the world.",
