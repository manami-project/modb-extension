    "text": "Musical dreams and adolescent drama intertwine in this captivating anime series, set within the prestigious Awajima Musical School Training Campâ€”fondly referred to as the 'boarding house'. This girls-only institution gathers aspiring young talents from across Japan, all vying to shine on stage. Among these hopefuls are Tabata Wakana, a starry-eyed student yearning for musical stardom; Takehara Kinue, the devoted housemaster honoring her best friend's legacy; the enchanting Okabe Emi, a scholarship student and center of attention; and Ibuki Katsurako, a teacher hailing from a lineage of actresses.\n\nThe unique atmosphere of the musical school serves as both a nurturing sanctuary and a fierce battleground, fostering both camaraderie and rivalry among the girls. Perseverance and dedication can cultivate burgeoning talents, but the path to success is fraught with harsh realities. The series offers a rich and intimate exploration of each character's journey, masterfully revealing their innermost thoughts and emotions.\n\nAs the narrative unfolds through various perspectives and timeframes, viewers will be captivated by the poignant and relatable experiences of these young women. With the added allure of a potential cameo from a character of 'Sweet Blue Flowers', this coming-of-age omnibus series promises a heartfelt and engaging viewing experience.",
