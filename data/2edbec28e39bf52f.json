    "text": "Soon, the tranquil kingdom of Wisler will be transformed into a battleground for the fiercest warrior women, as a grand tournament promises a fortune to the victor. Among the contenders is the kingdom's very own Princess Minerva, who, despite her royal status, seeks to escape her privileged life.
