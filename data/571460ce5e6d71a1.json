  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a hard-won era of tranquility, Meliodas and his band of friends are forced back into the fray when a formidable magical alliance emerges, threatening to obliterate all they've fought for. This narrative unfolds between the final episodes of Nanatsu no Taizai: Fundo no Shinpan, incorporating elements from the manga's concluding chapter.\n\nFollowing the intense culmination of the fourth season, the Seven Deadly Sins disperse, under the false assumption that all battles have been won. However, during Meliodas and Elizabeth's visit to the hometowns of Elizabeth's past lives, they cross paths with Zeldris, Gelda, and two unexpectedly powerful entities - a fairy king believed to have vanished and Dubs, a master artisan from the Giant Clan.\n\nThis duo's strength proves overwhelming, leading to the abduction of Meliodas and Elizabeth. Simultaneously, the demon realm is under siege, and events such as King and Diane's wedding are disrupted by fairy and giant raids. These attacks are orchestrated by the highest authority, with a singular objective: the annihilation of the Seven Deadly Sins.\n\nForced into an unlikely alliance with demons, the Seven Deadly Sins must fight not just for their survival, but for the preservation of their world. \"The Seven Deadly Sins: Cursed by Light\" is nestled between episodes 23 and 24 of the fourth season, bringing the manga's final chapters to life.",
