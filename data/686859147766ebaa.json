  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Assassin's Creed-obsessed high school student Chio Miyamo faces an uphill battle every morning: getting to Samejima Private Academy on time. With her late-night gaming sessions and penchant for attracting bizarre obstacles, Chio's daily commute turns into a thrilling adventure filled with overenthusiastic kabaddi players, bewildered bikers, and unexpected detours.\n\nArmed with her unconventional video game-inspired tactics, Chio – also known as the legendary assassin 'Bloody Butterfly' – transforms her ordinary route into a chaotic playground. Alongside her best friends, Manana Nonomura and Yuki Hosokawa, she navigates the absurdity of her daily life, from avoiding confrontations by diving into trash bins to posing as an assassin to justify knocking over a motorcycle.\n\nJoin Chio and her friends as they navigate the treacherous path to school, turning every obstacle into an opportunity for laughter and camaraderie. Will they ever make it to class on time? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: Chio's journey is anything but ordinary.",
