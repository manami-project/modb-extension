  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After completing difficult quests, Shirase rewards Masato and his adventuring party with a beach vacation. They eagerly change into swimsuits, ready to relax and have fun under the sun. However, Masato struggles to enjoy himself with his overly doting mother Mamako by his side. In a freak accident, Masato hits his head and loses his memory. Seizing the opportunity, Mamako claims she is someone special to Masato. Believing her, Masato starts viewing Mamako as an attractive, older woman and caters to her every wish. Their companions Wise and Medhi observe this strange dynamic unfold. They worry that with Masato solely focused on Mamako, he has lost interest in their in-game quests which is problematic for the entire party. The question remains whether Masato will regain his memories and return to his senses or continue to dote on Mamako in his confused state.",
