    "text": "During her first year at the esteemed Hakoniwa Academy, Medaka Kurokami, an extraordinary student, achieves an unprecedented feat by becoming the first freshman to secure the position of Student Council President, with an overwhelming 98% of the votes. A paragon of perfection, Medaka is not only academically gifted and athletically inclined, but also hails from a wealthy family and enjoys immense popularity among her peers.\n\nIn an effort to make others happy and address their concerns, Medaka introduces the 'Medaka Box,' a suggestion box where students can anonymously submit their problems or requests for assistance. Joined by her reluctant childhood friend, Zenkichi Hitoyoshi, the duo takes on the challenges presented by the suggestion box, tackling issues ranging from the mundane to the extraordinary.\n\nAs Medaka and Zenkichi work tirelessly to fulfill each request, they begin to uncover a sinister plot that revolves around the academy and Medaka herself. With every completed task, the pair adds flowers to the student council room, aiming to fill the entire school. However, as the stakes get higher and the challenges become increasingly perilous, Medaka and her allies must confront unexpected abilities and dark secrets that threaten to disrupt their lives and the very foundation of Hakoniwa Academy.",
