  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Boy magician Seth, along with his companions Melie and Doc, finds new allies in the fortress of the Knight-sorcerers, Caislean Merlin, as they all pursue the menacing creature known as Némésis. As Seth's journey gains momentum, he crosses paths with Ocoho, an aspiring Knight-sorcerer, and bids farewell to Melie and Doc. The sinister Merchant-Barons pose a new challenge, even as the relentless Inquisition continues to hound him.\n\nThe city of Caislean Merlin, however, is under constant threat from the enigmatic Spectrum Némésis, entities believed to herald disaster. Seth's mission to unravel the truth behind this new form of Némésis becomes more urgent than ever.\n\nMeanwhile, the Inquisition's covert branch, the Thaumaturges, has launched a crusade against corruption. Their newest recruit, Dragunov, is tasked with tracking down a young magician with horns sprouting from his head—none other than Seth himself!\n\nAs Seth delves deeper into the mysteries surrounding his own identity and the source of all the chaos, he must confront the decaying world of the Wizard Knights' island-continent. Plagued by haunting visions that grow more frequent by the day, Seth must navigate these trials and tribulations in his quest for self-discovery and truth.",
