    "text": "The monotonous corporate life of Sasaki, a middle-aged Japanese office worker, takes an unexpected turn when he adopts an adorable Java sparrow named Peeps to alleviate his loneliness. Unbeknownst to him, Peeps is actually a powerful sage from another world named Piercarlo, who has been banished to Earth in the form of a bird. To regain his rightful place in his own world, Piercarlo bestows Sasaki with magical powers and the ability to travel between worlds. As Sasaki embarks on a magical adventure filled with swords, sorcery, and colorful characters, he attempts to use his newfound powers to live a peaceful and comfortable life. However, his tranquil life is abruptly disrupted when he inadvertently becomes involved in a supernatural struggle in Japan and is forced to join a secret agency to track down gifted criminals. With a war about to break out in the other world, Sasaki must become an unlikely hero to protect peace in both worlds.",
