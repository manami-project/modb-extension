    "text": "In a whimsical twist on a classic fairy tale, Snow White embarks on a daring quest after pilfering a pair of enchanted red shoes from her wicked stepmother, Regina. These magical shoes have the power to transform her into royalty, but they're not hers to keep. Regina, a powerful witch, will stop at nothing to reclaim her prized possession.\n\nMeanwhile, seven courageous princes, cursed and transformed into dwarves, embark on their own quest for the red shoes, believing a kiss from the princess wearing them will break their spell. Snow White, in her search for her missing father, teams up with these dwarves, promising to aid them in their mission.\n\nAs they journey together, they face numerous challenges and learn invaluable lessons about inner beauty and the power of friendship. This outrageous parody, filled with humor and heart, promises a unique spin on the traditional fairy tale, proving that sometimes, the most unlikely heroes can save the day.",
