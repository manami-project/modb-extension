    "text": "On the brink of a historic revelation, Mina Tepes, the ageless vampire queen and supreme leader of all creatures of the night, emerges from the shadows after eons in seclusion. With the immense fortune of the Tepes dynasty at her disposal, she wipes out Japan's national debt, securing the right to establish a sanctuary for her kind on the Japanese coastline â€“ the Vampire Bund. As the world eagerly awaits the groundbreaking press conference, sinister forces plot to silence Mina before she can unveil her peaceful vision.\n\nAs chaos unfolds, Mina encounters Akira Kaburagi, a man whose connection to her past is as enigmatic as it is powerful. Unbeknownst to him, Akira harbors a hidden identity that resurfaces upon meeting Mina, revealing him to be a werewolf bound by fate to protect the vampire queen. Together, they must confront ancient evils and human adversaries who doubt Mina's intentions, all while safeguarding their unlikely bond.\n\nAs the world grapples with the revelation of vampires, Akira struggles with his newfound identity and the resurgence of forgotten memories. With the odds stacked against them, can Mina and Akira maintain their delicate alliance and usher in a new era of peace for vampires and humans alike?
