    "text": "Shonen Jump's Grand Prize-winning anime unveils the tale of Testa, a prodigious 17-year-old university professor with an unparalleled gift for languages. Recruited by his superior, Sergeant Rossa, Testa joins the Allied Cryptanalysis Department with a formidable mission: decipher the enigmatic Luger Code, a secret communication tool employed by werewolves, humanity's sworn enemies.\n\nThe code's unique encryption leaves Testa baffled, as the only discernible sound it emits is the haunting howl of a wolf. Despite tireless research, Testa's efforts to crack the code prove futile. Desperate to advance his cryptanalysis, he embarks on a daring quest to capture a live werewolf. After exploring every conceivable avenue, Testa finally crosses paths with Yonaga, a female werewolf who might just hold the key to unraveling the Luger Code's mysteries.",
