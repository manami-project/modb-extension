    "text": "Neko Girl's affection, and navigate the trials of school life, all while embracing his unique heritage and destiny as the last heir of the Ghost Tribe. With his father's guidance, now in the form of a talking eyeball, and the support of his flustered caretaker, Kitarou takes on the responsibility of bridging the gap between humans and youkai, often shielding humans from the mischievous intentions of the supernatural creatures. This adaptation of Kitarou's story is deeply rooted in the original Hakaba Kitarou manga, the source material that sparked the creation of the beloved Gegege no Kitarou series in the late 1960s.",
