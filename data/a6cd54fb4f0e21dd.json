  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Night World is an original anime project directed by Ryo-timo as a companion piece to singer Aimer's album \"Walpurgis\". It explores the dreamlike Night Realm overseen by the mysterious entity Yoru, who guides troubled children through their darkest memories and emotions so they can find closure. The first episode follows young Chiyo, who is struggling to accept her dog's death. As she falls asleep, she enters the Night World and meets Yoru, who helps her process her grief. In the second episode, best friends Hina and Tsumugi experience a falling out over Hina's new friendship. The jealous Tsumugi enters the realm and is confronted by her own feelings of loneliness. The third episode centers on Akatsuki, a frustrated artist who has lost her passion. As she rediscovers an old sketchbook and letter from a forgotten friend, she begins to reclaim her creative spirit. Through beautifully animated abstract imagery and a starless dreamscape that slowly lights up, Night World captures the haunted nature of nighttime. Yet its ultimate message seems to be that by facing our painful memories and inner shadows, we can find catharsis and move forward with our lives. Yoru serves as a guide through this healing process occurring in the land where darkness blooms.",
