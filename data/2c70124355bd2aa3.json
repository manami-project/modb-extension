  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Believing they inhabit completely different worlds, Amane Fujimiya, a reclusive loner, and Mahiru Shiina, a stunning model student known as 'Angel', have never exchanged a single word despite being neighbors. However, their paths intertwine when Amane offers Mahiru his umbrella during a rainstorm, leading to an unexpected bond. As Mahiru begins to notice Amane's poor self-care and living conditions, she takes it upon herself to help him by cooking and cleaning for him.\n\nAs they spend more time together in Amane's apartment, the unlikely pair starts to explore the depth of their connection. Despite their contrasting personalities and lifestyles, the once-distant neighbors find themselves growing closer. The simple act of sharing meals and afternoons together causes them to question whether the possibility of love between them is truly zero.\n\nIn this tender tale of budding romance, two young people navigate the complexities of their emotions and the narrowing gap between their worlds. Will the unlikely connection between the aloof loner and the divine beauty blossom into something more, or will they remain just neighbors?",
