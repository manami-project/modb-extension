  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kakushi Gotou is a popular manga artist who leads a double life - while publicly known for creating mainstream works, he secretly authors popular erotic manga under a pen name. As a doting single father to his young daughter Hime, Kakushi is determined to keep his true profession hidden from her at all costs out of fear that she would be disappointed in him. To maintain this facade, Kakushi resorts to increasingly absurd lengths to prevent Hime from uncovering the truth, from disguising himself when leaving for work each day to conducting emergency home drills in case she stumbles on his studio. Despite the paranoia-fueled chaos, Kakushi strives to give Hime a happy childhood and preserve their loving relationship. However, as Hime grows older, keeping his secret becomes more and more difficult. Kakushigoto is a comedic tale of a devoted father navigating the tricky waters of parenthood while struggling to prevent his two very different worlds from colliding. With plenty of laugh-out-loud moments, this anime also presents a heartwarming exploration of the unbreakable bond between father and daughter.",
