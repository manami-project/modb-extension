  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime, derived from an acclaimed shoujo manga by Shinohara Chie, presents the challenging journey of an adolescent girl who unexpectedly metamorphoses into a leopard-like lycanthrope. Caught in the throes of her newly emerged predatory instincts, she grapples to maintain her humanity amidst her beastly transformation. The narrative unfolds in a unique 30-minute animated music video, set to a series of pop songs and interspersed with manga stills, that was released in 1987. As the young protagonist navigates her newfound feline DNA and the accompanying monstrous alterations, viewers are treated to a compelling exploration of survival and self-discovery.",
