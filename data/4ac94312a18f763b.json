  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Reigan Marin, a native of the polluted and devastated planet S-1, embarks on a mission to protect Earth from an imminent invasion by his former world. With his formidable mecha, Baldios, Marin becomes Earth's unlikely ally in the fight against Zeo Gattler and his followers, who seek to claim Earth as their new home after their own world has become uninhabitable due to extreme pollution.\n\nAs the looming battle draws near, Marin must convince the divided World Federation of his sincerity and unite them against the common enemy. But with suspicions running high and trust in short supply, can Marin and the Blue Strike Force join forces to defeat the Red Fighters and prevent Earth from suffering the same fate as S-1?\n\nFeaturing footage from the original TV series and some new content, this anime film presents a thrilling tale of interplanetary conflict, environmental responsibility, and the power of unity in the face of overwhelming adversity. With two versions available, the 117-minute and the shorter 99-minute US version, viewers can choose their preferred experience for this epic space war.",
