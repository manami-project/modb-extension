    "text": "Tower ing above the kingdom of Uruk, the ominous Tower of Druaga stands as a beacon of fear and intrigue. Every five years, during the celestial event known as the Summer of Anu, the divine protection of sky-god Anu weakens the tower's demonic inhabitants, presenting a rare opportunity for brave souls to ascend its treacherous heights. The Uruk army, led by King Gilgamesh, seizes this chance to establish a stronghold on the first floor, the bustling city of Meskia, and embark on a mission to vanquish the formidable demon Druaga.\n\nHowever, the army isn't alone in their quest. Adventurers from all walks of life, lured by whispers of the legendary Blue Crystal Rod resting at the tower's pinnacle, join the perilous race to the top. Among these daring adventurers is Jil, a young and determined guardian, who, alongside his motley crew of allies, aims to slay Druaga and secure the powerful artifact. As competing factions, each with their own agendas, converge within the tower's walls, the stage is set for an epic showdown during this extraordinary summer.",
