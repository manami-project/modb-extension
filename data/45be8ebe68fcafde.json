  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The narrative follows Miu Nomura, a soft-spoken high school student with a deep-seated passion for the piano. Despite her reserved nature, she harbors a secret affection for her upperclassman, Kazuya Takahashi, finding it challenging to even glance at him. Miu's journey is not just about navigating the complexities of adolescent love, but also about her musical voyage. Having played the piano for years, she struggles with self-doubt, feeling that her performances lack heart, despite her technical precision.\n\nUnder the tutelage of her mentor, Mr. Shirakawa, Miu decides to participate in a recital, choosing to perform a self-composed piece that reflects her emotional journey. The rhythm of her life, punctuated by joyous moments with friends and family, and the silent longing for Kazuya, resonates in her piano notes. As Miu embarks on this musical and personal odyssey, she strives to find the melody within her heart and the courage to let it resonate with the world.",
