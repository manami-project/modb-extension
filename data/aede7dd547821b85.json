    "text": "In the thriving metropolis of Russell City, a sinister plot lurks beneath the surface, threatening to disrupt the city's prosperity. A secret organization known as the Makai Order stands as the city's last line of defense against creatures called Horrors, which are born from negative human emotions. Among the Makai Order's ranks, a formidable warrior named Sword holds the prestigious title of Golden Knight, granting him the power to wield the Garo armor and blade. As Sword battles against the Horrors, he uncovers a cryptic clue related to the looming threat: \"El Dorado.\"\n\nWhile investigating the mysterious phrase, Sword crosses paths with Sophia 'Sophie' Hennis, a determined young woman searching for her missing brother. The only lead she has is the same enigmatic phrase: \"El Dorado.\" Drawn together by their shared connection to the mysterious term, Sword and Sophie form an alliance to unravel the truth behind the conspiracy and find Sophie's missing brother. As they delve deeper into the secrets surrounding \"El Dorado,\" their bond strengthens, and they become each other's strongest ally in the fight against the Horrors and the hidden forces threatening Russell City.",
