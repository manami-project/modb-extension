  "synopsis": {
    "text": "At the dawn of time, the first demon Yuan Di came to earth and was worshipped as the Demon Primogenitor. Millions of years later, the legendary Monkey King is rescued from captivity by Tang Monk, a Buddhist monk on a pilgrimage to retrieve sacred scriptures. As they travel together, the Monkey King protects Tang Monk from danger. Meanwhile, an ancient demon king who was sealed away long ago is accidentally freed from his imprisonment when the Monkey King recklessly destroys a sacred tree at a temple. Seeking revenge, the demon king promptly kidnaps Tang Monk. The Monkey King now has just three days to save his master and stop the demon king from fully restoring his power and destroying the world. It becomes clear that the Monkey King and this resurrected ancient foe are destined for an epic final confrontation that will determine the fate of the world. With Tang Monk's pilgrimage - and potentially all of existence - hanging in the balance, an ultimate battle between the two powerful demons looms.",
