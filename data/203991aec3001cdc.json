  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After disappearing at the end of the previous season, Ai Enma, the Hell Girl, mysteriously returns by possessing the body of Yuzuki Mikage, an ordinary schoolgirl. Yuzuki is now forced to share her body with Ai, aware of Ai's presence and able to see what she sees. Ai's three former helpers - Ichimoku Ren, Wanyuudou, and Hone-Onna - had been living normal lives since Ai's disappearance. But their peace is suddenly shattered when Kikuri, another agent of hell, returns to recruit them back to Ai's service. With Ai back in action through Yuzuki's body, the Jigoku Shoujo operation resumes, offering vengeance to those who access the Hell Correspondence website. Still bearing grudges from their past lives, both the living and the dead will call upon Ai to ferry souls to Hell. As an unwilling host, Yuzuki struggles to maintain her real life and relationships as she's dragged further into Ai's dark world. With reunions, new grudges, and Ai's mysterious revival, will the Hell Girl's ceaseless duty ever end? Or is her task doomed to continue forever, condemning more tortured souls to Hell?",
