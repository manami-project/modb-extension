    "text": "Putting behind his embarrassing middle school days of grandiose delusions and imaginary powers, Yuuta Togashi steps into high school with a single desire: to live an ordinary, uneventful life. However, his plans for normalcy are quickly derailed when he crosses paths with the eccentric Rikka Takanashi. Rikka, a self-proclaimed wielder of the 'Wicked Eye', is a fellow chuunibyou sufferer, a condition that makes individuals believe they possess extraordinary abilities. As Rikka drags Yuuta into her whimsical world, his past as the 'Dark Flame Master' resurfaces, threatening to shatter his dreams of a mundane high school life. With Rikka's unpredictable antics constantly challenging his reality, Yuuta finds himself torn between embracing his old persona and striving for normalcy. This heartwarming and humorous tale follows Yuuta's struggle to balance his desire for an ordinary life with the chaotic yet endearing world of Rikka's chuunibyou.",
