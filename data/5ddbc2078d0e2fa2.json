  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nangou, a compulsive gambler drowning in debt, finds himself in a high-stakes Mahjong game against the ruthless yakuza, wagering his life as the final bet. As the game unfolds, the odds are heavily stacked against him, and the specter of death looms closer. In a twist of fate, a young boy named Akagi Shigeru, seeking refuge from a stormy night and the police, stumbles into the seedy Mahjong parlor. In a desperate attempt to turn the tide, Nangou entrusts his life to Akagi, teaching him the basics of the game. The yakuza members chuckle at the sight of the inexperienced boy, but their amusement soon turns to disbelief as Akagi's natural talent for Mahjong emerges. That fateful night, the legend of Akagi - a prodigious gambler who fearlessly challenges death - is etched into the annals of the dark Mahjong underworld.",
