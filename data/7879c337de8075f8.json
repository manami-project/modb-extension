    "text": "Based on the information provided, this anime takes place in a sci-fi world where humanity faces threats from multiple extraterrestrial forces. Six months after a previous war between Earth and the alien Aerogators, the Earth Federation Government is still rebuilding and facing continued battles. New threats emerge, including a mysterious organization called the Shadow Mirror that is arming rebel Divine Crusader remnants with advanced technology. Interdimensional beings called Einsts also appear, connected psychically to human ATX pilots Kyosuke and Excellen. Furthermore, a new group of aliens called the Inspectors arrives, aiming to retake control lost in the previous Aerogator war. In the midst of this complex four-way conflict, Lamia Loveless, a spy sent by the Shadow Mirror to infiltrate the Earth government, wrestles between her duty and newfound friendships. The series centers around the crews of the spacecrafts Hagane and Hiryuu as they once again become embroiled in an interstellar struggle to determine the fate of humanity and Earth.",
