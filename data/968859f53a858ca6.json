  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A young man embarks on a journey of self-discovery, unsure of his path but determined to move forward. As he transforms and evolves, his heart and mind drift until discovering his purpose. This poignant anime explores the struggle of finding one's way, while emphasizing the need to persevere through life's uncertainties. Originally a graduate project, the animation garnered acclaim for its evocative visuals and contemplative message. Directed by Yukie Nakauchi and featuring an emotive score, it invites viewers to connect with the protagonist's winding road to self-realization. More than a coming-of-age tale, this anime speaks to the shared experience of seeking meaning and chasing dreams into the unknown.",
