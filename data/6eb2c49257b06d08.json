  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, in the not-so-distant future, the boundaries between humans and androids have vanished, allowing our species to thrive amidst the stars. This transformation was essential for survival, as Earth was no longer a viable home. As a result, human emotions and connections, such as love, family, and intimacy, have faded into obscurity, becoming mere whispers of a forgotten past. In this world, an android fighter-pilot named Atterion finds himself a captive of the enigmatic Quadropods. As they siphon the energy source Sentia from his memories, Atterion uncovers a hidden strength within his human heart.\n\nThis captivating tale is brought to life in a visually stunning six-minute 3D animated short film, inspired by the evocative 'Gynoid' illustrations of Hajime Sorayama. The creative collaboration between Studio 4Â°C, Shirogumi, and American filmmaker Rashad Haughton, with art direction by Tatsuyuki Tanaka, has resulted in a breathtaking CG animation crafted meticulously by eye, using live-action sequences as reference models. Immerse yourself in this extraordinary journey that explores the depths of humanity and the power that lies within.",
