  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime focuses on the Tokyo regional qualifiers for the national high school volleyball tournament. Four powerhouse teams - Nekoma High School, Fukurodani High School, Nohebi Academy, and defending national champions Itachiyama Institute - battle for the three qualifying spots. Nekoma, fueled by their long-standing rivalry with Karasuno High from Miyagi prefecture, is determined to make it to nationals to set up a rematch from last year's Battle at the Garbage Dump. Their first obstacle is a tough Fukurodani squad. The two teams have a rivalry of their own, so the match promises to be hard-fought and intense. Both Nekoma and Fukurodani possess strong attacks and defenses. The outcome likely comes down to which team better handles the pressure. With nationals on the line, both sides battle not just their opponent, but also nerves and doubt. Yet through perseverance and teamwork, the winning trio ultimately prevails to advance.",
