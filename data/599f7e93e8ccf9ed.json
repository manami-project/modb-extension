  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Clad in enigmatic darkness, a new protagonist emerges in the crime-ridden Beika City, notorious for its alarmingly high murder rate and perfect crime-solving record. This time, the spotlight shifts from the young detective Conan to the elusive figure often seen in the shadows: Makoto Hanzawa, the culprit. Hailing from Izumo, Hanzawa has a singular mission: to assassinate a specific target. But before he can execute his sinister plan, he must navigate the complexities of everyday life, from finding a place to live to securing a job, all while encountering a host of eccentric characters. Will Hanzawa successfully adapt to this perilous part of Tokyo and complete his mission? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: he must tread carefully in a city where every crime is eventually solved. This anime, a spin-off from the popular Detective Conan series, offers a fresh perspective by focusing on the usually anonymous figures behind the crimes.",
