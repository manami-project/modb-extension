  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nippon, Italia, and Deutschland, once symbols of powerful empires, now find themselves personified as unique individuals in a world teeming with chaos and war. Italia, a lover of pasta and the epitome of clumsiness, is joined by the stoic and pragmatic Deutschland, who's constantly grappling with his eccentric allies. Nippon, a picture of tranquility with a hint of peculiarity, completes this unlikely trio known as the Axis Powers.\n\nSet against the backdrop of World Wars I and II, this comedic and lighthearted take on historical events reimagines nations as diverse, engaging characters. As the Axis Powers navigate through tumultuous times, they're frequently met with the unruly Allied Forces, whose centuries-old differences often hinder their united front.\n\nBased on Hidekaz Himaruya's popular webcomic-turned-print-manga, this historical comedy offers a fresh perspective on culture, global relationships, and the absurdity of war. Prepare for a wild ride as these charming personifications of nations rewrite history with their quirky antics and unexpected camaraderie.",
