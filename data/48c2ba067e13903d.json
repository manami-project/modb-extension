    "text": "The stage is set in the not-so-distant future of Tokyo, 2040, where Reito Mizuhara, a medical student, has been cryogenically frozen to combat an incurable ailment known as cellular sclerosis. Upon his awakening, he finds the world drastically altered by the devastating Male Killer (MK) virus, which has wiped out nearly all men on the planet. As one of the five remaining men, immune to the virus due to their cryosleep, Reito is now tasked with the mission of repopulating the Earth.\n\nHowever, Reito's heart remains loyal to his childhood sweetheart, Elisa Tachibana, who mysteriously vanished three years prior. While other survivors embrace their newfound role in this radically changed world, Reito embarks on a quest to locate Elisa, navigating through a web of global conspiracies and resisting the allure of a world teeming with temptation. Can Reito unravel the enigma surrounding the MK virus, find his lost love, and save humanity from the brink of extinction?",
