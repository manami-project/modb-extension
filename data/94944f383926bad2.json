    "text": "In the 74th year of the Cosmic Era, the bitter conflict between Earth-based Naturals and space-residing Coordinators nears its end. Amidst this turmoil, Kira Yamato takes command of the Strike Freedom Gundam, leading the Archangel crew in a desperate mission to neutralize the Requiem, a devastating weapon capable of annihilating most of humanity. As Kira fights for the universe's survival, his closest friend and formidable rival, Athrun Zala, must confront his former subordinate, Shinn Asuka, who now pilots the mighty Destiny Gundam. Shinn, driven by the belief that Athrun is a traitor, seeks to remove him from the path of a peaceful future. As intense mobile suit battles unfold, determining the galaxy's fate, a complex human conflict marches towards its inevitable conclusion.\n\nThis anime serves as a remake of Gundam Seed Destiny's final episode, offering additional scenes, minor alterations, and an after-war epilogue, providing a glimpse into the future of the Cosmic Era.
