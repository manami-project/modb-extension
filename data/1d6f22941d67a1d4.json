    "text": "In a distant future, Earth has fallen to the reign of Godzilla, a colossal beast that stands at an unprecedented 300 meters tall. The remnants of humanity, once fled to the stars in search of a new home, have returned to confront their monstrous overlord. Led by Captain Haruo Sakaki, the humans discover the remnants of Mechagodzilla, now a self-regenerating nanometal city, offering a glimmer of hope in their desperate struggle. However, the use of this powerful weapon creates a rift among the humans and their alien allies, the Bilusaludo. Haruo, unwilling to sacrifice his humanity, destroys the nanometal city, leaving the survivors in disarray.\n\nAs hope dwindles, the enigmatic Exif offer an alternative path to salvation through their mysterious religion. Yet, Haruo remains skeptical of the Exif's leader, Metphies, and his connection to the ominous, golden-clad King Ghidorah. With the Earth trembling under the arrival of this new threat, Haruo must navigate the complex web of alliances and determine the true nature of Godzilla, as the final battle for Earth's future looms on the horizon.",
