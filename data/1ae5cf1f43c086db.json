  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Orario gains a new attraction - a natural hot spring opened by the Dian Cecht Familia, masters of potion-making. But Naaza of the rival Miach Familia smells something fishy. Believing the bathwater is artificially created to scam customers, Naaza asks Bell and the Hestia Familia to help expose the truth. Once again, poor Bell finds himself stuck in the middle of a Familia feud. Infiltrating the elaborately guarded bathhouse won't be easy between the armed staff and strange surroundings. But the threat of foul play compels Bell to take action. Will he uncover a con or natural wonder? Either way, hijinks and hilarity await at this questionable new hot spot.",
