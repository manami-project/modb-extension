  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime is a collection of heartwarming and moral-based short stories, directed by the pioneering animator Kitayama Seitarou. Inspired by the Japanese folklore \"Hanasaka Jiijii\" or \"Hanasaka Jiisan,\" the narrative revolves around an elderly, childless couple and their beloved dog.\n\nOne day, the dog unearths a treasure box filled with gold coins in the couple's garden. Envious of their newfound wealth, their neighbor borrows the dog in the hopes of finding his own fortune. However, his greed leads to disastrous consequences.\n\nThe story takes a magical turn when the couple receives divine guidance from their deceased dog in a dream. They are instructed to chop down the fig tree under which the dog was buried and craft a mortar from its wood. To their astonishment, any rice placed in the mortar transforms into gold.\n\nYet again, the envious neighbor attempts to replicate the miracle, only to be met with failure and misfortune. The climax unfolds when the couple, following another dream instruction, sprinkles the mortar's ashes on cherry trees, causing them to bloom spectacularly. The Daimyo, struck by the sight, bestows them with bountiful gifts.\n\nThe neighbor's attempt to mimic this miracle results in dire consequences, teaching a profound lesson about the perils of greed and envy. This captivating anime promises a blend of magic, morality, and the power of love and loyalty.",
