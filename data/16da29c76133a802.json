  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hikari Yagami, a fifth-grader, is eagerly anticipating his summer camp when Tokyo's interconnected technology begins to malfunction. Trains are running amok, traffic signals are behaving erratically, and mobile networks are in disarray. Suspecting a cyber-attack, Hikari learns that his mother and sister are trapped on an uncontrollable train. Rushing to their aid, he is suddenly transported into an unfamiliar realm - the city's digital network. Here, he encounters Agumon, a Digimon, who is battling against malevolent Digimon responsible for the chaos in Tokyo's network. Armed with a Digivice, a device that allows communication with the undigitized world, Hikari teams up with Agumon to thwart the cyber-attacks threatening the world. Unbeknownst to humans, the digital network they rely on daily has become a habitat for life forms known as Digimon, residing in a realm of light and darkness. As the DigiDestined, Hikari embarks on a thrilling adventure to save both the digital and real worlds. This anime, set in the present day, is a reboot of the original series featuring the same protagonists but telling a completely new story.",
