    "text": "Ai Hoshino, a 16-year-old pop idol sensation from the group B Komachi, captivates the world with her charm and talent, while concealing her true self behind a veil of lies, as is common in the entertainment industry. When she announces a hiatus due to health concerns, her fans, including gynecologist Gorou Amemiya, are left worried. Amemiya, working in a countryside medical practice, wishes to meet Ai one day, and his wish comes true when she arrives at his hospital, not ill, but expecting twins. Amemiya promises to help Ai deliver her children safely, unaware that this encounter will drastically alter his relationship with the idol.\n\nHowever, fate takes a cruel turn when Amemiya is murdered by Ai's delusional stalker on the eve of her delivery. In an unexpected twist, Amemiya is reincarnated as Aquamarine Hoshino, one of Ai's newborn twins. As he navigates his new life as the child of his favorite idol, Amemiya becomes determined to help Ai achieve stardom while protecting her from the darker aspects of the entertainment industry. But as they face numerous challenges and unforeseen disasters, Amemiya wonders if the glamorous world of showbiz will tarnish Ai's shine or if they can rise above it together.",
