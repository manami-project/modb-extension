  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so, the tale of Karada Iokawa and Shoko Nogami unfolds in an unexpected twist of fate. Karada, a lively and dependable girl on the brink of junior high, yearns for the day she'll be treated as an adult, rather than a child. Her older brother, Hiro, returns from abroad after their parents' passing to care for her, accompanied by his former lover, Shoko, a poised yet occasionally childish woman.\n\nAs tensions rise between Karada and Shoko, Karada prays at a local shrine for maturity. Little does she know, her wish will be granted in the most peculiar way. As Karada ages, Shoko finds herself transformed into a child, and the two must navigate their new realities together. With their ages reversed, they must learn to coexist and face the challenges of their new lives, all while managing their complex romantic entanglements.\n\nIn this enchanting anime, the lives of Karada, Shoko, and Hiro intertwine through a mysterious wishing stone, leading them on a journey of self-discovery, growth, and understanding. As they grapple with their newfound circumstances, they must confront the true nature of adulthood and the consequences of their heartfelt desires. Will they find a way to return to their original ages, or will they learn to embrace their transformed lives? Only time will tell.",
