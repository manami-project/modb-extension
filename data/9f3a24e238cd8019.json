    "text": "So, the Armed Detective Agency is in a tight spot, labeled as terrorists and pursued by the Hunting Dogs, a special military police unit. Their leader, Yukichi Fukuzawa, is under arrest, and Doppo Kunikida is offered a deal to join the Hunting Dogs for his freedom. Meanwhile, Akiko Yosano faces execution, and Osamu Dazai is locked in a power struggle with Fyodor in a maximum-security prison.\n\nHowever, hope glimmers when Atsushi Nakajima discovers a clue to the location of a history-altering book page. As Atsushi, Kyouka, Ango, and Lucy devise a rescue plan, master detective Ranpo Edogawa and Edgar Allen Poe work on freeing the trapped detectives. But can they outsmart Fyodor's cunning schemes?\n\nSimultaneously, Ranpo Edogawa and Atsushi Nakajima seek the help of Ouchi Fukuchi, the Hunting Dogs' captain, to locate Kamui, the leader of the terrorist group Decay of the Angel. Fukuchi's past with the Agency's president might be the key to earning his trust, but can they rely on his honor? As Kamui closes in, the Agency's survival hangs in the balance. Will they turn the tide or fall into Fyodor's trap once more?",
