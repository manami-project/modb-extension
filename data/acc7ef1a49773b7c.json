    "text": "She athed in a future marred by war, destruction, and chaos, \"Planetarian (Movie)\" unfolds a poignant tale based on the visual novel by Key. The once vibrant world now lies desolate under a perpetual blanket of grey clouds, with the sun and stars hidden from sight. Amidst this bleak landscape, a young scavenger known as Junker stumbles upon an abandoned rooftop planetarium while searching for scrap metal.\n\nInside, he encounters Yumemi Hoshino, a service robot steadfastly awaiting the return of customers long gone. The planetarium's projector, meant to display the starry sky, lies broken. Driven by an unexpected sense of purpose, Junker teams up with the robot girl to repair the projector, a decision that will irrevocably alter their destinies. This adaptation of the visual-novel interweaves the original narrative with content from the Hoshi no Hito light-novel sequel, offering a captivating exploration of hope and resilience in a world teetering on the brink of despair.",
