  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wise wolf deity, Holo, finds herself at odds with the young shepherdess, Nora, during a shared dinner with their mutual companion, seasoned merchant Kraft Lawrence. As Holo's health unexpectedly deteriorates due to exhaustion, she is confined to bed rest, plagued by peculiar dreams and yearnings for sweet treats. Lawrence, in a nurturing role, tends to Holo, striving to restore her health by managing the delicate balance of the four elements - hot, cold, dry, and wet.\n\nDuring her convalescence, Holo reflects on her past and her burgeoning feelings for Lawrence, drawing them closer together. However, the lingering tension with Nora remains a persistent issue. In an unexpected turn of events, a shared jest at Lawrence's expense bridges the gap between Holo and Nora, fostering a newfound camaraderie.\n\nThis heartwarming tale follows the journey of Lawrence and Holo as they traverse through various cities, navigating the trials and tribulations of a traveling merchant's life. Along the way, they encounter religious zealots, forge deals, and cultivate a tender bond, all while inching closer to Holo's northern home, Yoitsu.",
