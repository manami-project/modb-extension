  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Holo the Wise Wolf, Lawrence the merchant, and Nora the shepherdess sit down to dine together while traveling. However, Holo harbors animosity towards Nora that sours the meal. Later, Holo falls dangerously ill due to fatigue. As she rests, feverish dreams of her ancient past and recent adventures with Lawrence fill her mind, intensifying her affection for him. Lawrence dutifully nurses Holo back to health by feeding her and regulating her humors. Through her sickness, their bond strengthens. Yet Holo's lingering bitterness towards Nora persists until the shepherdess visits and manages to make amends over jokes at the merchant's expense. United in fellowship once more, the travelers continue their northward journey.",
