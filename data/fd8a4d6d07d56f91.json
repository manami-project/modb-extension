    "text": "Set in 1966 in the seaside town of Sasebo, Japan, \"Sakamichi no Apollon\" tells the coming-of-age story of lonely teenager Kaoru Nishimi. Kaoru has moved constantly due to his father's naval career and once again finds himself struggling to adjust to a new school. However, his life is changed forever when he meets notorious bad boy Sentarou Kawabuchi, who introduces Kaoru to his passion for jazz music. Through his newfound friendship with Sentarou and gentle jazz fan Ritsuko Mukae, Kaoru discovers the basement jazz sessions at Ritsuko's family's record store. As Kaoru learns piano to participate in these lively jam sessions, he begins to break out of his shy shell. Playing jazz gives Kaoru an emotional outlet to express himself freely and bond with Sentarou and Ritsuko over their mutual love of music. Over this life-changing summer in 1966, the three form close friendships and help one another grow. They face complex issues of love and identity while living youthfully through jazz. As Kaoru finds joy and connection through jazz music with his first real friends, he has an unforgettable coming-of-age experience.",
