  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiromi Maiharu moves from Nagasaki to Kamakura and struggles to ride a bicycle on her first day of high school. She meets Tomoe Akitsuki who helps train her in cycling. The school principal Ryuko considers Taiwan as a destination for a school trip since it is an advanced cycling nation. She sends the cycling club there to inspect it. Upon arriving in Taiwan, Hiromi and her friend Sandy get separated from the group. This anime follows Hiromi's fresh start in Kamakura as she learns to cycle with help from new friends, and later goes on an eventful school trip to Taiwan with her cycling club. Through Hiromi's eyes, we explore the sport of cycling in a foreign land and the bonds of friendship that see her through mishaps far from home.",
