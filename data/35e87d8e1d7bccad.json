  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Following the turbulent era of the Warring States in ancient China, two war-orphaned slaves, Xin and Piao, nurture a shared ambition to rise above their circumstances and become formidable Great Generals. Trained rigorously together, their lives take a drastic turn when Piao is summoned to serve in the royal palace. Caught in the throes of a treacherous power struggle, Piao barely escapes with his life and returns to Xin, gravely injured. Before his death, Piao entrusts Xin with a mission to meet the young King of Qin, Ying Zheng, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Piao. As Xin embarks on his perilous journey to fulfill his friend's last wish, he finds himself embroiled in the blood-soaked annals of China's history, determined to carve his own path to greatness in the age of the Seven Warring States.",
