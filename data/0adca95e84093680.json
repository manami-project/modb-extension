The Vandels, ruthless creatures capable of controlling monsters, have plunged humanity into an age of despair. But hope remains in the form of the Vandel Busters, a group of brave warriors who fight against these tyrannical beings. Among them, the Zenon Squad is renowned as the strongest on the continent.\n\nOne fateful day, Beet's reckless behavior leads to a tragic encounter with the powerful Vandel, Beltose. The Zenon Squad, in a heroic act, sacrifices their lives to protect Beet and bestows upon him their elemental weapons, the Saigas, imbued with their life energy. Burdened with guilt and a newfound purpose, Beet embarks on a journey to master the Saigas and become the greatest Vandel Buster.\n\nWith his childhood friend Poala by his side, Beet forms the Beet Warriors, vowing to end the dark age and restore peace to the land. Along the way, he hopes to find the Zenon Warriors, who may still be alive, and fulfill their legacy. Join Beet as he faces insurmountable odds, armed with courage, determination, and the power of the Saigas, in his quest to put an end to the Dark Century once and for all.",
