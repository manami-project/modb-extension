  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Blu-ray Box set of Steins;Gate introduces an alternate 23rd episode, setting the stage for Steins;Gate 0. In this version, Okabe, having reached his emotional limit, decides not to assist Suzuha Amane, a time traveler, in her quest to avert World War III. This decision stems from Mayuri's plea to Suzuha to stop depending on Okabe for preventing the war. Consequently, Okabe never receives the Movie Mail from his future self, remaining oblivious to Operation Skuld. Unable to prevent Kurisu's death and the impending war, the story transitions into the narrative of Steins;Gate 0. As Okabe discards his eccentric scientist persona and assumes the guise of an ordinary university student, his friend Mayuri is elated, believing he is recovering from his past traumas. However, Okabe's demeanor suggests otherwise, hinting at a critical divergence in the timeline where the weight of destiny surpasses all boundaries.",
