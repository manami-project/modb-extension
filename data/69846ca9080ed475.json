  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This alternate 23rd episode of Steins;Gate explores a tragic timeline where Okabe fails to prevent World War III. Exhausted from the emotional toll of repeatedly trying and failing to save Makise Kurisu, Okabe refuses a critical request from time traveler Suzuha to once again alter the past. Without Okabe's help, Suzuha is unable to initiate Operation Skuld, the plan to avert global disaster. A broken Okabe subsequently abandons his eccentric mad scientist identity, to the delight of his dear friend Mayuri. However, despite the cheerful facade, Okabe remains secretly tormented. This critical moment marks the genesis of the Steins;Gate 0 timeline - one where the weight of destiny surpasses Okabe's ability to change the future. Will Okabe find the strength to fight fate once more? Or is the path set for catastrophe? This pivotal episode sets the stage for an intensely emotional journey in the acclaimed Steins;Gate sequel.",
