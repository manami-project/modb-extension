    "text": "On the vibrant landscape of Neverland, where humans and monsters coexist, the journey of two unlikely heroes unfolds in the Generation of Chaos. The first tale follows Chiffon, a renowned monster trainer who finds his abilities waning. As he embarks on a mission to return his cherished Hiyokomushi to its birthplace in Hiyoko Forest, chaos unfurls as his control over the monster weakens, turning the journey into an unpredictable adventure.\n\nThe second narrative focuses on Roze, a half-demon living harmoniously with humans alongside her beloved sister, Emilia. However, their peaceful existence is shattered when Roze returns home one day to find it ablaze. This devastating event serves as a harsh reminder of the prevailing discord between demons and humans, forcing Roze to confront the grim reality of their coexistence.\n\nAs Chiffon grapples with his fading powers and Roze faces the harsh realities of her world, their stories mark the beginning of an epic saga filled with chaos, courage, and the relentless pursuit of harmony.",
