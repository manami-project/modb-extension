  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime features characters from Attack on Titan enlisted as the Sky Survey Corps, tasked with protecting the Wall Skytree in a walled city surrounding the iconic Tokyo Skytree tower. When an army of Titans suddenly appears outside the wall, including a massive 350-meter Titan looming motionless near the tower, the Corps must battle to defend the Skytree and its patrons. This thrilling short was screened exclusively at the Skytree Round Theater, bringing the action of Attack on Titan to life right next to the Skytree itself. Will skilled fighter Levi and determined titan-shifter Eren lead the Survey Corps to victory against the imposing Titan threat before it's too late? This gripping anime pits beloved characters against formidable giants in a creative spin on the acclaimed Attack on Titan series that fans won't want to miss.",
