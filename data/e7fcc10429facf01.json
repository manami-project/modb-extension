    "text": "Summer break is winding down for Hayate, Nagi, and their friends as they spend the final days of freedom at Nishizawa's countryside vacation home. However, their idyllic getaway is soon disrupted by the emergence of a mysterious spirit with an ominous plan to permanently separate Nagi and Hayate. When Nagi suddenly vanishes without a trace, Hayate embarks on a desperate search to find his young mistress before it's too late. With Nagi's safety and their relationship as butler and mistress hanging precariously in the balance, Hayate races against time to rescue Nagi from her supernatural captor. Meanwhile, Nagi finds herself trapped alone in a bizarre, dangerous amusement park filled with traps and puzzles. As Hayate pursues every lead to locate Nagi, she must stay resourceful and determined to survive this surreal ordeal. At the heart of this supernatural crisis seems to be a silver-haired woman who holds the key to explaining the inexplicable events overtaking Hayate and Nagiâ€™s world. Will the butler and mistress be able to reunite and restore their everyday lives? Or will their bond be shattered forever by this paranormal threat?",
