  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Naruto and Anzu are wealthy siblings who live alone after the death of their parents. Naruto is extremely overprotective of his sister Anzu, confining her to their family mansion for \"security\" reasons and preventing her from having a normal social life. On her 16th birthday, Anzu rebels and escapes from the mansion with the help of a kitten she had secretly brought home. Naruto catches up to Anzu and finally agrees to give her more freedom, but tragedy strikes and both siblings die in an accident. Miraculously, their parents intervene from beyond the grave and bring the siblings back to life, with one catch - Naruto is reincarnated as a kitten! Now Anzu is finally free to live independently, while Naruto-the-kitten continues to watch over his beloved sister, still as patronizing as ever. Anzu names the kitten after her late brother without realizing his true identity. This comedic story explores themes of overprotectiveness, freedom, and the unbreakable bonds between siblings. Though restrictive at first, Naruto's devotion to Anzu proves enduring even through death and reincarnation.",
