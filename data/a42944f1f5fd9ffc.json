    "text": "In the heartwarming tale of Anzu and Naruto Nozaki, two siblings find themselves navigating the complexities of life and freedom after inheriting their deceased parents' vast fortune. Naruto, driven by an intense desire to protect his beloved sister, confines Anzu to the family estate, fearing the dangers of the outside world. Yearning for independence, Anzu defies her brother's overbearing watch on her 16th birthday, escaping with a newfound feline companion.\n\nAs fate would have it, a tragic accident befalls the siblings and the kitten, leading to their untimely demise. However, their parents intervene from beyond, granting them a second chance at life. But there's a catch: Naruto is reincarnated as a cat. Anzu, unaware of her brother's new form, cherishes her furry friend, noticing an uncanny resemblance to Naruto's protective nature. She names the kitten in his honor, embracing her newfound freedom while still being watched over by her devoted brother.",
