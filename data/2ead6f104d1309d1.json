  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Our protagonist finds himself suddenly transported to another world. Upon arrival, he is immediately forced into an arranged marriage by a sect leader seeking a partner for his daughter. Though initially shocking, this sets our hero on the path of cultivation and adventure. We learn that traveling between worlds has become commonplace, though the specifics of our protagonist's sudden transportation remain a mystery. His fortuitous timing, arriving just when the sect leader needs a fake husband for his daughter, kickstarts his new life's journey. The universe contains endless forms of life and souls. All beings seek the enlightened path of Taoism to gain power, long life, and freedom. However, the road is one of struggle - few can attain the Tao in any era. Furthermore, even masters of the Tao cannot escape greater powers that harvest entire worlds for spirituality across eons. Our protagonist peels back the layers of secrets shrouding these destructive harvesters. Joined by companions, he grows in strength while confronting the masters who cultivate worlds for their gain. Though the task is immense, he persists in his epic quest.",
