  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When members of the Fairy Tail guild travel to a distant town on a mission to apprehend a destructive mage, they become separated upon arrival. Coincidentally, Haru and his companions from Rave Master, including his friend Elie, have also found themselves split up in this very same town. In an improbable turn of events, Elie crosses paths with Lucy and Happy from Fairy Tail, who are desperately searching for their missing teammate Natsu. At nearly the same time, a motion-sick Natsu encounters Haru, who is wandering the streets looking for his own missing friends. Although Elie seems friendly, her appearance matches the description of the chaotic mage that Fairy Tail was sent to stop. This, coupled with Natsu learning of her connection to Haru, causes him to wrongly suspect the two may be dangerous accomplices. As miscommunications continue to pile up between the two groups, tensions escalate rapidly. Powers collide when the protagonists of both series are pitted against each other over the misunderstandings. However, they may need to band together when the true villain makes themselves known. This crossover blends the worlds of two acclaimed series by acclaimed manga artist Hiro Mashima. Friends become foes, only to later join forces against threats new and old.",
