  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Momo...in the realm of mortals, she is a figure draped in white, her presence akin to that of a Death God or Shinigami. Her companion is a winged black cat named Daniel, and her tool is a blunt yet radiant scythe. Momo's purpose is to carry the souls of humans, but her touch is not one of despair. Instead, it brings forth a wave of kindness and sorrow that sweeps through the world. As a compassionate Death God, Momo sheds tears at the sight of poignant moments and grants the dying their final wishes, filling their last moments with warmth and fulfillment. With Daniel by her side, Momo embarks on a journey to touch the hearts of humans and fill the world with benevolence.",
