    "text": "Marin and her younger sister Urin are seafolk who live a peaceful life under the waves. When a ring falls into the ocean, the kind-hearted Marin decides to return it to its owner. After an arduous journey, the sisters reach land and cross paths with Kanon, a high school girl who reveals she tossed the ring after a bad breakup. Though Marin tries to return it, Kanon refuses and discards the ring once more. As the sisters search for the ring, Urin accidentally releases Sedna, an ancient evil, from captivity. The turtle elder Matsumoto then appears and names Marin the Priestess of the Sea, destined to reseal Sedna. When Kanon discovers she is the Priestess of the Sky, she is hesitant but agrees to work with Marin. Now, the two maidens must overcome their differences and unite their powers before Sedna's dark forces consume the world.",
