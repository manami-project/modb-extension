  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Each of the four groups—BAE, The Cat's Whiskers, cozmez, and Akanyatsura—are invited to participate in the mysterious Paradox Live competition hosted by the legendary CLUB Paradox. The competition offers a chance to win 10 billion yen and the opportunity to compete against the legendary rapper group Buraikan. The rappers use accessories made of Phantom Metal, a metallic substance that reacts with their DNA to create illusions linked to their emotions during their performances. However, using Phantom Metal can also cause rappers to relive past traumas and painful memories, leading to debilitating reactions that can affect their psyche. As the competition heats up, the hidden motives of each group come to light, and the path to glory becomes more ruthless than they could have imagined. The future of hip-hop is at stake, and only one group can come out on top.",
