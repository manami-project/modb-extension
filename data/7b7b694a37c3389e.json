    "text": "Ren Kaidou, a boy more comfortable with canines than humans, finds his life intertwined with Haru Kaidou, his new adoptive brother, after Haru's mother deceives him into returning home for the summer. Initially, Haru struggles to connect with the antisocial Ren, but as the summer days pass, their bond deepens. Haru pledges to Ren that they will live together in Japan post his high school graduation. However, a tragic accident erases Haru's memories of their shared summer and his promise. Five years later, Ren arrives in Tokyo, expecting Haru to honor their pact, but Haru has no recollection of his estranged brother or the bond they once shared.
