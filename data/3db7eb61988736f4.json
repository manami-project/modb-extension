    "text": "Urushi Yaotome, the skilled Shogi player and president of her high school's unofficial Shogi Club, has an unexpected admirer in Ayumu Tanaka, a middle school kendo champion and newcomer to the game of Shogi. Ayumu, smitten by Urushi's beauty and talent, joins the club with the sole intention of getting closer to her. However, he sets himself a challenging goal: to confess his feelings only after defeating Urushi in a fair match. Despite his inexperience and Urushi's strategic prowess, Ayumu remains undeterred, his determination fueled by his affection for her. As they engage in intense Shogi matches, Ayumu's unwavering praise for Urushi and his expressionless demeanor often leave her flustered, turning the Shogi board into a battleground of love and strategy. Will Ayumu ever make his move and confess his feelings, or will his love remain a pawn in their thrilling Shogi games?",
