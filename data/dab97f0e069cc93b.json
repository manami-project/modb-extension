Though she lives a carefree childhood playing in the surrounding woods, her world shifts when Mattis's rival Borka moves into the other half of the split stronghold. As tensions rise between the bands of outlaws, Ronja befriends Birk, Borka's son. Now torn between loyalty to her father and her first real friend, Ronja grapples with the reality of Mattis's violent livelihood that conflicts with her youthful innocence. Through fantastical forest adventures and mystical encounters, she struggles to reconcile justice and family. Can Ronja maintain her friendship amidst feud and robbery? Her coming-of-age journey lays bare truths about lawlessness, morality, and the bonds of camaraderie.",
