  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Light dreamed of becoming an adventurer, but fate had other plans. When he visited the temple to receive his skill fruit, he ended up with the lackluster Nut Master ability instead of something heroic. While his childhood friend gained the mighty Sword Saint skill, Light was resigned to life as a humble farmer. However, Light soon discovered his Nut Master skill had a secret power - allowing him to consume multiple skill fruits without dying. As he tasted fruit after fruit, Light amassed a vast array of skills. He went from zero to hero, transforming from a talentless farmer to the mightiest adventurer the world had seen. With his unparalleled strength and a growing harem at his side, Light set out to prove he could become the adventurer he always dreamed of being. This is the tale of an underdog who beat the odds to claim his destiny, one tasty fruit at a time.",
