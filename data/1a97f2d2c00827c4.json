    "text": "Shiki, a suspenseful anime, unfolds in the tranquil village of Sotoba, where an unidentified epidemic wreaks havoc on its unsuspecting inhabitants. Three women find themselves entangled in the escalating chaos: Nao Yasumori, haunted by spectral visions; Kanami Yano, concealing a dangerous secret to protect a loved one; and Motoko Maeda, grappling with unbearable grief as the enigmatic illness ravages her family. As the crisis intensifies, the bonds of kinship are stretched to their breaking point, with even minor missteps threatening to tear them apart.\n\nThe anime's eighth and ninth Blu-ray Disc/DVD volumes offer exclusive, unaired episodes, enhancing the viewing experience. The eighth volume, slated for release on May 25, 2011, includes Episode 21 and the unaired 'Dai Futatō to Han wa' (Episode 20.5), while the ninth volume, due on June 22, features Episode 22 and the unaired 'Dai Futatō-ichi to Han wa' (Episode 21.5).\n\nAs the hunt for the elusive Shiki reaches its peak, the undead scramble to find refuge from the impending daylight. One group seeks sanctuary in the abandoned irrigation pipes on the village outskirts, only to have their hiding spot exposed. Amidst the relentless patrols, Motoko Maeda confronts the harrowing repercussions of her fateful encounters with the Shiki.",
