    "text": "The anime follows the unfolding of a mysterious epidemic in the quiet, secluded village of Sotoba. As the illness spreads and claims more lives, tensions rise within the community. Three women find themselves at the center of the escalating crisis. Nao Yasumori is plagued by disturbing visions of the dead. Kanami Yano harbors a secret that risks severing her bonds with a loved one if revealed. Motoko Maeda is devastated as the disease ravages her family. Their relationships are put to the test by the chaos surrounding them. Even minor missteps now have the power to permanently damage the ties that bind. The story comes to a head as the healthy villagers begin hunting the undead Shiki believed to be causing the deaths. One group hides in disused irrigation pipes but their location is discovered while they rest. Elsewhere, Motoko suffers further tragedy in her encounters with the creatures. With dawn approaching, the Shiki desperately seek shelter from daylight, while the villagers continue patrolling for them. This suspenseful series examines how an inexplicable crisis can unravel relationships and communities through grief, secrecy, and suspicion. Yet bonds of family and friendship also show their resilience.",
