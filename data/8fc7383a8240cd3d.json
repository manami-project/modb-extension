  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Schoolâ€™s entrance ceremony under a cherry blossom tree marked the beginning of a unique bond between Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa. Despite their contrasting personalities, they found themselves drawn to each other, walking home together daily. Miou, a reserved art club member, and Haruki, an outgoing movie club star, were often mistaken for a couple. Yet, their relationship lingered in the ambiguous zone between friendship and romance. As their feelings deepened, they struggled to bridge the mere 10 centimeters that separated them, a distance that seemed insurmountable. As their final year of high school approached, they, along with their friends, faced the daunting task of deciding their future careers and confronting their unspoken feelings. This is a tale of two individuals, their dreams, and the seemingly small yet significant distance that keeps them apart.",
