  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Miou Aida and Haruki Serizawa meet under the cherry blossoms at their high school entrance ceremony, feeling an instant connection. Though opposite in personality - Miou is reserved while Haruki is outgoing - they begin walking home together after school. As third years about to graduate, their friendship grows into something more. Yet their relationship stays undefined, to the confusion of their friends. Miou pursues art while Haruki directs films, chasing separate dreams. With diverging futures, the distance between the once inseparable pair widens. As the cherry blossoms fall on their final year, Miou and Haruki struggle to bridge the gap between them. Though they now stand side by side, hearts yearning, a chasm of 10 centimeters divides their hands. Will the two who felt fate's pull under the spring flowers overcome the space that remains, or will missed chances scatter like petals on the wind?",
