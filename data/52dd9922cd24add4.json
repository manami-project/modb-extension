  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There is an eerie amalgamation of rotoscope animation and live-action footage in Kowabon, with a chilling theme of 'Bondage x Stylish Horror'. The anime delves into the omnipresence of cameras in our contemporary world, capturing moments that might be better left unseen.\n\nIn this technologically advanced era, the uncanny and inexplicable can appear even more petrifying, and Kowabon capitalizes on this fear of the unknown. The unsuspecting characters are thrust into harrowing encounters with the supernatural, witnessed through the lenses of everyday technology. From a parking lot surveillance camera capturing a chilling spectacle to a seemingly ordinary video chat taking a sinister turn, the victims are left grappling with their terrifying realities.\n\nHowever, the fate that awaits these unfortunate souls might be even more dreadful than their worst nightmares, hinting at a horror that transcends death itself. Kowabon invites viewers to delve into this unsettling world, where the familiar and mundane can morph into something far more sinister.",
