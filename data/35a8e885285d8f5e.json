    "text": "Shi Jiajie and Xia Lei are best friends who make money playing online virtual reality games. Jiajie is the gamer, while Lei creates hacks. With Lei's parents threatening to send him abroad unless the duo earns more, Jiajie decides to compete in the prestigious \"God Street Competition\" tournament on the popular game Epoch. After mysteriously receiving an Epoch gaming device, Jiajie enters the contest seeking the grand prize. However, Lei soon discovers Epoch's unhackable code and realizes Jiajie is trapped - unable to exit the game or even hear Lei's voice. As Jiajie progresses deeper into the tournament, he uncovers there is more to Epoch's lifelike world than meets the eye. With Jiajie's consciousness fully immersed in Epoch's \"real fantasy world\", the game is not what it seems. The self-aware NPCs and inexplicable events point to a conspiracy hiding beneath Epoch's surface. To rescue his friend and reveal Epoch's secrets, Lei races against time before the conspiracy ensnares Jiajie completely.",
