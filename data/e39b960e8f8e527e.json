  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tonpei is a lazy pig with a penchant for stealing food from hardworking monkeys like Sarukichi. When Tonpei assaults some monkeys and gets beaten up in retaliation, he lies to the lion king to gain sympathy. Believing Tonpei's tale, the lion king decides to confront the monkeys, leading to an escalating conflict that eventually becomes an all-out war involving tanks, guns, and airplanes. Though the spark was a minor theft and assault, tensions that had been simmering between the pigs and monkeys are brought to a boil by Tonpei's actions and dishonesty. What begins as a dispute between individuals rapidly intensifies into wholesale violence between species. Yet the root catalyst is the pig Tonpei's arrogance, laziness, gluttony, and subsequent lies to cover up his misdeeds. His flaws incite calamity for both his own kind and the monkeys.",
