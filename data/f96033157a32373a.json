    "text": "Black Jack is a brilliant but unlicensed surgeon who travels the world using his exceptional medical skills to help those in need. Assisted by his devoted young assistant Pinoko, Black Jack takes on strange and difficult cases that other doctors cannot solve, though his services do not come cheap. Though a man of science and rationality, Black Jack is frequently surprised by the power of love and nature to surpass medical limitations. His own past is shrouded in mystery, hinted at being filled with turmoil. Yet none of this stops the driven doctor from pursuing his calling to heal and save lives whenever possible. In one peculiar case, Pinoko befriends a stray dog that steals her purse. When the dog gets hit by a truck, Pinoko pleads with Black Jack to save it. Though initially reluctant, the surgeon is swayed to help the canine, while Pinoko hopes to give it a new home. Later, Black Jack travels into the remote woods to aid a patient, only to find himself embroiled in a strange serial murder case where he becomes the key suspect. With his keen intellect and Pinokoâ€™s support, the ingenious doctor works to uncover the truth behind the bizarre happenings.",
