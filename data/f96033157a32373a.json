  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dog ged by a mysterious past, the unlicensed medical maverick, Black Jack, navigates the world of strange and perplexing medical cases alongside his smitten assistant, Pinoko. A prodigy in his field, Black Jack's genius allows him to save lives that others deem hopeless, albeit for a hefty fee. As a man of science, he remains skeptical until faced with irrefutable evidence, yet he often finds himself humbled by the inexplicable power of love and nature.\n\nOriginally part of the 2004 Black Jack series, this installment features two captivating episodes, one of which is entitled \"The Dog Thief Kamaitachi in the Woodlands.\" In this tale, an unexpected encounter with a mangy mutt during Pinoko and Sharaku's playtime in the park leads to a daring chase and a tragic accident. Determined to save the injured canine, Pinoko pleads with Black Jack to intervene, but will she be able to convince him to let her keep the purse-snatching pooch?\n\nIn the second episode, Black Jack finds himself entangled in a baffling murder mystery after responding to a summons from a former patient, Doctor Clonen. Lured to a secluded forest lodge, the brilliant surgeon becomes the prime suspect in a series of killings, forcing him to rely on his wits and expertise to clear his name.",
