  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Usagi and Chibiusa overhear two girls discussing the Sailor Senshi at a cafe after noticing a poster of the heroes. As the girls debate which Senshi is the smartest, most elegant, strongest and the leader, Usagi confidently claims those titles for herself, while Chibiusa shakes her head at Usagi's delusions. Clips from the debut of each Sailor Senshi are shown with their image songs playing. Even when Tuxedo Mask is mentioned, the girls neglect to discuss Sailor Moon. Usagi interrupts and asks directly about her hero persona. While the girls compliment Sailor Moon's virtues, they also bluntly list her faults, in contrast to the other Senshi. Usagi sarcastically apologizes for being a clumsy crybaby before bursting into tears. It's clear that while Sailor Moon is beloved, she has some quirks that set her apart from her seemingly perfect allies.",
