  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mask ed beneath the casual chatter of two strangers, Usagi and Chibiusa discover an unexpected topic of conversation at a local café - the renowned Sailor Senshi. As the girls enthusiastically debate the smartest, most elegant, and strongest among the Senshi, Usagi confidently asserts herself as the epitome of these qualities. Chibiusa, however, remains skeptical of Usagi's self-proclaimed greatness.\n\nAs the discussion unfolds, the girls reminisce about the debut of each Sailor Senshi, accompanied by their respective image songs. Even the dashing Tuxedo Mask finds himself a topic of conversation. Yet, to Usagi's dismay, the one heroine left unmentioned is Sailor Moon herself. Unable to contain her curiosity, Usagi interjects, inquiring about the mysterious guardian.\n\nThe girls offer a mix of praise and criticism for Sailor Moon, a stark contrast to their earlier assessments of the other Senshi. Once the girls depart, Usagi sarcastically apologizes for her perceived shortcomings, before succumbing to a wave of emotion.\n\nIn this heartwarming and humorous exchange, the café transforms into a stage for the unsung tales of the Sailor Senshi, leaving Usagi to grapple with her complex feelings about her own alter ego.",
