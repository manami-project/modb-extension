  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Haze's duty to protect humans, Shana—the 'Flame-Haired Burning-Eyed Hunter'—has a unique focus on one human: Yuuji Sakai, a teenage boy unwillingly entangled in the struggle between Crimson Denizens and Flame Hazes. As Shana's feelings for Yuuji deepen, they must set aside their emotions to face new threats. A transfer student with a striking resemblance to an old enemy arrives, and the Bal Masqué organization plots their next attack. Meanwhile, Yuuji grapples with a mysterious time loop, reliving a seemingly ordinary day in September. As they navigate their complex relationship and battle powerful adversaries, Shana and Yuuji must protect the coveted 'Midnight Lost Child' within Yuuji's body. Amidst girl troubles and supernatural challenges, Yuuji continues his training to safeguard the artifact that grants him life: Reiji Maigo, from the clutches of Bal Masque.",
