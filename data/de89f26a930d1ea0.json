However, when his classmate Seungtaek sees him on a failed date dressed in women's clothing, Seunghee's secret is exposed.

Whenever they are alone after school at Gyu-bin's house, the nature of their interactions changes in unexpected ways. Now that Seunghee's sexuality has been revealed at school, it remains to be seen whether he can preserve the ordinary life he cherishes.
