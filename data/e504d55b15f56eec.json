    "text": "In the anime film featuring two stories, Natsume crosses paths with different youkai that lead to eventful encounters. In \"Ishi Okoshi,\" Natsume meets Mitsumi, a small youkai tasked with awakening the powerful divine youkai Iwatetsu from deep slumber. Seeing Mitsumi's dedication, Natsume decides to assist him, unaware that others also seek to rouse Iwatetsu. The second story titled \"Ayashiki Raihousha\" begins when a mysterious visitor appears before Natsume's friend Tanuma. The stranger converses briefly with Tanuma daily. Though the visitor claims harmless intent, Natsume determines he is a disguised youkai. Despite enjoying the meetings, Tanuma's health falters, fueling Natsume's wariness about the guest's sudden manifestation and relationship with Tanuma. As the two stories progress, Natsume contends with the consequences of meddling gods and unfamiliar spirits to protect both mortal and immortal allies. With keen wisdom and compassion, he navigates precarious situations that promise to impact all realms of existence.",
