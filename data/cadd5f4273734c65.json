Despite their stark contrasts, Kotoko's feelings for Naoki have only grown stronger since her first day of high school. Unfortunately, Naoki's disdain for those he deems unintelligent has left Kotoko's love unrequited.\n\nWhen an unexpected earthquake destroys Kotoko's home, she finds herself living under the same roof as Naoki, thanks to her father's friendship with Naoki's father. Seizing this golden opportunity, Kotoko remains hopeful that her proximity to Naoki will help her win his heart.\n\nAs they navigate their new living situation, Kotoko's unwavering optimism and relentless pursuit of Naoki's affection lead to a series of hilarious and heartwarming moments.

Will her determination and newfound closeness to Naoki be enough to melt his icy exterior and make him see her in a new light?
