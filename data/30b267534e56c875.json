    "text": "Gigantea en bouton? As the cherry blossoms bloom at Lillian Girls' Academy, a new chapter begins for the Yamayuri Council. The graduation of the current Rosas looms, ushering in a wave of change and bittersweet goodbyes. Yoko, Eriko, and Sei, the esteemed leaders, must come to terms with leaving their cherished petite soeurs behind, while Sachiko, Rei, and Shimako strive to create a memorable farewell for their beloved grandes s≈ìurs.\n\nThe void left by Sei's departure poses a challenge for the White Roses, and the search for a worthy successor begins. Amidst the whirlwind of emotions, Yumi's self-doubt lingers as she grapples with her role as Sachiko's petite soeur and a member of the student council. The arrival of Sachiko's distant relative, Matsudaira Touko, adds another layer of complexity to Yumi's fragile position.\n\nAs the academy welcomes new faces and bids farewell to old ones, the bonds between the Roses are tested. In the face of adversity, they must navigate the delicate balance of preserving tradition and embracing the inevitable change that spring brings. With the hope that the colors of their feelings will not fade like the chrysanthemums, the Roses forge ahead, determined to make this season one to remember.",
