The story follows Lelouch Lamperouge, who has achieved victory in several battles against the Britannian Army through the use of his paramilitary organization the Black Knights. Lelouch possesses great military and intellectual prowess as well as a supernatural power called Geass that allows him to issue absolute commands. However, Lelouch faces ongoing obstacles that threaten his rebellion, including the combat skills of Suzaku Kururugi and the appearance of a mysterious child named V.V. Despite the challenges, Lelouch continues his fight against Britannia and aims to further strengthen the Black Knights. This film serves as the second part in a trilogy of theatrical remakes covering the events of the first two seasons of the Code Geass anime series. With vivid animation and enhanced production values from its parent series, this film promises to retell Lelouch's epic rebellion against Britannia in an exciting new way for both existing fans and newcomers alike.",
