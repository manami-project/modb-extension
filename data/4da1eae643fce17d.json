    "text": "Pikotarou, the comedian behind the viral song \"Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen,\" stars in this unique anime that puts a comedic spin on beloved fairy tales. In each 3-minute episode, Pikotarou is inspired by an illustration from director Takashi Taniguchi to improvise an absurd bedtime story featuring classic characters like the Little Match Girl and Little Red Riding Hood. Voicing every role himself with his signature wacky energy, Pikotarou transforms these iconic tales into silly short skits sure to make viewers laugh before drifting off to sleep. Though scriptless and spontaneous, his zany ad-libbing gifts these age-old stories with a distinctively modern, meme-worthy flair. For those seeking both nostalgia and novelty in their anime, Pikotarou's creative remixes add an entertaining new twist to timeless tales.",
