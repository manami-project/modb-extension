    "text": "Sidonia, a colossal generation ship, has been the sanctuary for the remnants of humanity after Earth was annihilated by enigmatic alien entities known as the Gauna. Following a century of peaceful drifting through the cosmos, the Sidonia encounters the Gauna once more, threatening the existence of mankind. A temporary triumph is achieved by the combined efforts of Nagate Tanikaze, a skilled Guardian mech pilot, and Tsumugi Shiraui, a human-Gauna hybrid.\n\nFast forward a decade, the inhabitants of Sidonia revel in a fleeting era of tranquility. As Nagate's heroic status grows, Tsumugi finds herself developing feelings for him. However, Captain Kobayashi remains vigilant, knowing that true peace is elusive as long as the Gauna persist. The decision is made to initiate a final battle that will determine the destiny of humanity's remaining survivors. As the end looms, the crew must fight to safeguard not only their loved ones but the future of humanity itself.",
