    "text": "Spring of their first year in high school, Kumiko Oumae hopes for a fresh start and to leave behind her past experiences with brass band competitions. However, despite her reluctance, she gets drawn into the high school's brass band club by her new friends, Hazuki Katou and Sapphire Kawashima. There, Kumiko unexpectedly reconnects with Reina Kousaka, a figure from her complicated middle school band days. Under the direction of their intense new advisor Noboru Taki, the ragtag band faces a choice - casually participate or push themselves hard towards the goal of nationals. With doubts resurfacing from her middle school failures, Kumiko remains uncertain if they should attempt reaching for nationals. Through the chaos of rigid practice schedules and band drama, friendships and relationships get tested. Kumiko grapples with repairing her bitter relationship with the committed trumpeter Reina. All the while, the driven band works to overcome their hurdles to find success together.",
