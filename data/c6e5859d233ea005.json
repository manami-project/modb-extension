    "text": "Hasukawa Kazuya finds himself in a heart-wrenching situation when his brother marries the woman he secretly loves. In an attempt to escape the uncomfortable living arrangement, he moves to the esteemed Ryokuto Academy, only to find himself in the midst of eccentricity at the Greenwood dormitory. Known for housing the school's misfits and oddballs, Greenwood is far from the tranquil haven Kazuya was hoping for.\n\nFrom motorcycle enthusiasts who prefer their bikes over people, to spectral beings seeking love, and a boy masquerading as a girl, the Greenwood dormitory is a melting pot of peculiar personalities. To Kazuya's dismay, his brother also works at the school's infirmary, making it impossible to completely avoid his past. Despite the initial culture shock, Kazuya manages to form deep bonds with his quirky dorm-mates, who become his pillars of support throughout his school life.\n\nAmidst the chaos and unpredictability of life at Greenwood, Kazuya embarks on a series of bizarre adventures, from traversing a fantasy world to fulfilling the wishes of ghosts. As he navigates through these extraordinary experiences, he gradually heals from his unrequited love and eventually encounters the girl of his dreams. Will Kazuya finally find the peace and love he's been searching for in this unconventional haven called Greenwood?",
