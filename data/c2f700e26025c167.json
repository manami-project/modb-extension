  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a world divided into the realms of deities, humans, and demons, a spirit seed was sent from the deities to aid humanity. However, it became corrupted and wrought destruction instead. The deity king Sen Luo sacrificed himself to contain the seed, causing the realm of deities to fade into obscurity. A thousand years later, ruins belonging to the lost deity sect Shangqing Xianmen emerged, containing powerful treasures. Rival sects battled ruthlessly to claim these relics. Qiao Sen, a police officer, befriended the pharmacist Tian Biyao and the assassin Huo Bingli while foiling multiple plots. They discovered the Heilong Society also sought a treasure to achieve global domination. Joining forces with his allies, Qiao Sen worked to increase his spiritual cultivation and rally support. Though initially enemies, he and Bingli fell in love amidst their struggles. Tian Biyao harbored unspoken affections for Qiao Sen as well. Together, the trio raced to prevent the Heilong Society from seizing the ruins and artifacts of Shangqing Xianmen for their nefarious goals.",
