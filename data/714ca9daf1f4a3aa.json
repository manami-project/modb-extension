    "text": "An unfamiliar land in a parallel universe, bereft of magic and mystical energies, is home to the Tang Clan, where martial spirits reign supreme. After ten millennia, the once-prosperous Tang Clan now teeters on the brink of oblivion. Amidst this turmoil, a new generation of gifted individuals emerges, bearing the potential to restore the Tang Clan to its former glory. Will the new incarnation of the formidable Shrek Seven Monsters succeed in rewriting the destiny of the unparalleled Tang Clan?\n\nIn this chaotic world, the Tang Sect finds itself in a precarious state of decline after ten thousand years of existence. The birth of an extraordinarily talented individual sparks hope for the revival of the Tang Sect. As ancient secrets, such as the existence of a soul beast over a million years old, the enigmatic Electrolux capable of picking stars, and the new soul utensil system that contributed to the Tang Sect's downfall, begin to surface, can the Tang Sect's secret weapons regain their edge? Will the Tang Sect rise from the ashes and reclaim its lost glory?",
