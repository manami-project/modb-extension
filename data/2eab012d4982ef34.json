    "text": "In 2060, the Organization of Emergency Affairs forms an elite crisis response team called the Bureau of Paranormal Defense to tackle supernatural threats. They select top agents from around the world to create the Phantom Squad, their ace team. Three years ago, Phantom Squad captain Hao Yuan leads his team into an ambush laid by the rogue agent Derrick while trying to retrieve a powerful treasure, the Stone of Immortality. Most of Hao Yuan's squad dies. Derrick sabotages Hao Yuan too, causing him to fall off a cliff. However, Hao Yuan absorbs the Stone of Immortality, reviving him and granting him time manipulation abilities. Wanting to avoid his tragic past, Hao Yuan goes into hiding. He lives a quiet life protecting Gu Xiao Xi, sister of his deceased squadmate. But when a deadly \"blue virus\" emerges in Y City, threatening Gu Xiao Xi's life, Hao Yuan is forced to return to the Bureau. He assembles a new Phantom Squad - sexy super spy Xia Rou, eccentric genius Tong Xiaoxiao, and quirky gangster Zhan Peng. Together, they race to find a cure for the virus and confront Hao Yuan's haunted past. Their legendary adventure is only just beginning.",
