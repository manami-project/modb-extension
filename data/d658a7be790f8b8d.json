  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hana, Saaya, and Homare take young Hugtan on a trip to see a flower meadow for the first time. But their outing is disrupted by the sudden appearance of a monster named Usobakka, who emerges from a strange portal and begins turning everything around them to stone with its petrifying powers. Usobakka swiftly defeats the Hugtto Precure girls, kidnapping Saaya and Homare. It declares its intention to rid the world of all Precure. Desperate, Hana seeks help from the Kirakira and Mahou Tsukai Precure teams, but Usobakka defeats and kidnaps them as well. As Usobakka rants about lies and broken promises, Hana has a revelation. She remembers making an important promise to a mysterious fairy boy named Clover when she was young - a promise she failed to keep. Hana realizes her broken vow could be connected to Usobakka's emergence and devious plan. With the Precure teams captured and her friends in peril, Hana must team up with the remaining Cures - Ichika and Mirai - to stop Usobakka. To save the day, she'll need to make things right with Clover and prove that even broken promises can be fulfilled. The final battle promises to test the bonds of friendship and the power of redemption.",
