  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hugtan's much-anticipated debut in a picturesque alpine flower field is disrupted when a formidable monster, Usobakka, emerges with a sinister plan to engulf the world in lies. Hana, Saaya, and Homare, the Hugtto! PreCure, find themselves outmatched and separated, with Saaya and Homare kidnapped by the relentless foe. As Usobakka targets other PreCure teams, Hana joins forces with Ichika from Kirakira PreCure A La Mode and Mirai from Mahou Tsukai PreCure!, only to witness their allies fall one by one.\n\nHaunted by Usobakka's taunts about broken promises, Hana recalls a forgotten vow she made to a mysterious boy named Clover, whom she encountered in a magical realm during her childhood. With the stakes higher than ever, Hana must confront her past and find the strength to convey her true feelings.\n\nAs the PreCure teams from three generations unite, they face an uphill battle against the seemingly invincible Usobakka. Can Hana and her fellow PreCure warriors harness their collective powers to defeat the monster, uphold the importance of promises, and save the world from an eternity of deception?",
