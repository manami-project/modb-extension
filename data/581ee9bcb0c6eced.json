  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unaired special episode, included with the limited edition of the manga's eighth volume, brings the focus on Inari and Kon's adventures. One fine day, Kon, aspiring to be a more powerful familiar, takes the form of a human and sets off to the town. She crosses paths with Shiro, the younger sibling of Kōji, who has run away from home following a disagreement with his brother about playing fireworks with their mother due to her work commitments. Kon finds herself dealing with Shiro's self-centered attitude until Inari, who has learned about the situation from Kōji, locates them. Inari quickly recognizes Kon in her human form and joins Shiro to the supermarket where his mother works. Shiro, upset at seeing his mother busy, runs away again. In an attempt to resolve the situation, Inari assumes the form of Shiro's mother and proposes to enjoy fireworks with him and Kōji. However, Shiro's tears reveal that he feels guilty for disturbing his mother at work. Ultimately, Shiro enjoys the fireworks with Kōji and Inari, and their mother manages to change her shift to spend time with them. Meanwhile, Kon gains valuable insights from her experiences. In another twist, Kon's human transformation occurs before she can even meet Inari, leading to an unexpected encounter with Shiro.",
