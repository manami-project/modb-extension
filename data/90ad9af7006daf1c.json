Fatally injured and on the brink of death, Jinwoo encounters a mysterious quest window that offers him a chance to level up and gain unparalleled strength. As he accepts the quest and begins to grow stronger, Jinwoo discovers that he is the only one with this ability, and he becomes determined to uncover the secrets behind his newfound powers. With the weight of his mother's medical bills and his sister's tuition on his shoulders, Jinwoo must navigate the dangerous world of hunters and dungeons, where he is both feared and envied by those around him.
