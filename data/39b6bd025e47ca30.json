    "text": "Set in the 22nd century, the world is filled with Medabots, intelligent robots powered by medals that serve as their consciousness. These Medabots engage in a popular combat sport known as Robattling, where Medafighters and their Medabots battle to climb the ranks and compete in the prestigious World Tournament. Ikki Tenryou, a ten-year-old dreamer, longs to become a top-notch Medafighter and represent his country. One day, Ikki discovers a rare medal and acquires an outdated Medabot, Metabee. However, the strong-willed Metabee refuses to follow Ikki's orders, leading to constant arguments between the two. As they navigate through local Robattles against opponents like the Rubberobo gang, Ikki and Metabee must learn to work together to achieve their dreams of becoming champions.",
