    "text": "Some time has passed since Rin, Nadeshiko, Chiaki, Aoi, Ena, and their friends enjoyed camping trips together in high school. Now young adults with jobs and responsibilities, they have lost touch with those carefree days. However, Chiaki reaches out to Rin with an exciting proposal. She now works for an organization promoting tourism in their hometown in Yamanashi. Her new project is to transform an abandoned property there into a public campground. Rin suggests rallying their old camping crew for help. Soon, the group reunites, feeling the nostalgia of their camping memories resurface. Nadeshiko now works at an outdoor gear shop, putting her expertise to use. Aoi is an elementary teacher who can educate future generations on camping. Ena's dog grooming skills prove invaluable. Together, they set out to design the ultimate campground experience. Through hard work and rekindled friendships, the campground takes shape. By creating a space for visitors to forge bonds and memories through camping, the group opens the door for new adventures. And for themselves, they rediscover the simple joy of being outdoors under the stars with good friends.",
