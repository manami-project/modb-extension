Rin Shima, now a working woman in Nagoya, receives a surprise message from Chiaki Oogaki, who is tasked with revitalizing a closed campground in Yamanashi Prefecture to boost tourism. Rin suggests involving their old camping buddies, Nadeshiko Kagamihara, Ena Saitou, and Aoi Inuyama, leading to a reunion filled with nostalgia and shared memories of their high school camping days. Together, they embark on this new adventure, combining their skills and passion for camping to create a space for future generations to enjoy, all while reminiscing about their youthful escapades.",
