    "text": "Saya is a young girl who is part human and part monster. She has faced unspeakable horrors and trauma in her past, including twisted experiments and the slaughter of her loved ones by flesh-hungry creatures. Driven by a burning desire for revenge, Saya tracks down the man responsible for her torment - Fumito Nanahara - to Tokyo. There, mysterious beasts have begun attacking and feeding on humans once again. Saya crosses paths with a group of ingenious young hackers named SIRRUT who are also seeking to expose Nanahara and the influential secret organization he represents. As Saya fights through lies, traps, and bone on her unrelenting quest for vengeance, SIRRUT attempts to sabotage Nanahara's political power and uncover the truth behind the human experiments that created the monsters Saya battles. With her hybrid human-monster abilities and fierce sword skills, Saya continues slaying the creatures while working with SIRRUT. But she ultimately can trust no one. Betrayal lurks around every corner on her lonely path of revenge. To get the vengeance she seeks, Saya must use all her strength and bravery to defeat the monsters and their master once and for all.",
