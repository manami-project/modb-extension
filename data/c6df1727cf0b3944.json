  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nana, a young girl with a tragic past, moves into the Kaede Inn, seeking a peaceful new life. However, her hopes are challenged by the presence of Nyu, whose alternate murderous personality, Lucy, once severely injured Nana. Fearing Nyu may relapse into violence, Nana struggles between coexisting with her or eliminating the threat. As Nana contemplates this dilemma, she attempts to prove her worth by contributing to the household, but her efforts often backfire comically. Yet through it all, she reluctantly forms a bond with Nyu. Meanwhile, Nyu experiences a painful flashback of her capture and the reasons she refrains from attacking certain individuals. With tensions high but bonds slowly forming, Nana must decide whether to give friendship a chance or give in to her understandable yet extreme fear of Nyu's monstrous other self.",
