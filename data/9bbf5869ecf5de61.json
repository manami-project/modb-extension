    "text": "The tale unfolds in a time-honored public bathhouse, where a vampire named Ranmaru, aged 450 years, has taken up part-time residence and employment. With an unquenchable thirst for the blood of an 18-year-old virgin, Ranmaru finds himself in the role of a guardian to Rihito, the 15-year-old son of the bathhouse proprietors.\n\nAs Rihito navigates the tumultuous waters of adolescence, he finds himself smitten with a classmate, a development that poses a significant threat to Ranmaru's plans. Desperate to preserve Rihito's virginity, Ranmaru embarks on a mission to thwart any romantic advances, marking the commencement of 'Operation Virginity Loss Prevention'.\n\nThis is a comedic narrative of bloody love, set within the confines of a venerable bathhouse, where a seasoned vampire and a high school boy of unblemished purity find themselves entangled in a web of unexpected circumstances.",
