    "text": "Techno, a reclusive and eccentric scientist, has spent his entire life hidden away in a nuclear bunker, observing the world from a distance. When the cheerful and well-endowed schoolgirl Hitomi accidentally stumbles upon his sanctuary while searching for her lost hat, Techno becomes instantly infatuated with her. Driven by his newfound feelings, he ventures into the outside world for the first time to pursue her. \nHowever, Techno's love for Hitomi quickly turns obsessive, and he begins to use his array of bizarre and advanced technological devices to manipulate and control her. He becomes fixated on bending her to his will, threatening her with death, mutilation, and even nuclear terror if she refuses to comply. Despite his twisted methods, Techno continues to attend school with Hitomi, attempting to maintain a facade of normalcy while subjecting her to his deranged whims. \nAs Hitomi struggles to maintain her sanity and identity in the face of Techno's relentless pursuit, she must find a way to escape his clutches before it's too late. Will she be able to break free from his control, or will she succumb to the nightmare that has become her life?",
