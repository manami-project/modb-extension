  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To escape his reclusive otaku lifestyle, Shinichi Kanou, born to a light novel author and an erotic game artist, applies for a job that values his extensive knowledge of anime, manga, and video games. Instead of landing his dream job, he's whisked away to the Eldant Empire, a fantastical realm brimming with elves, dragons, and dwarves. Tasked by the Japanese government to be a 'moe missionary,' Shinichi must promote otaku culture in this parallel world.\n\nAlongside his newfound companions—the half-elf maid Myucel and the youthful empress Petralka Anne Eldant III—Shinichi navigates the challenges of political strife, social classes, and ethnic discrimination. As he strives to bring 'moe' culture to this enchanting land, he also grapples with the notion that he might be an intruder in this world of magic and wonder.\n\nIn this captivating anime, follow Shinichi's journey as he uses his unique skills to bridge the gap between two vastly different worlds, overcoming obstacles and forging friendships along the way. Will he succeed in his mission to spread the love for otaku culture, or will the trials of this fantasy world prove too much for him to handle?",
