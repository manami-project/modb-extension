  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Haruka Nanase has loved swimming and being in water since he was young. In elementary school, he was part of a swim team with his friends Makoto Tachibana, Nagisa Hazuki, and Rin Matsuoka. Together they won a relay race tournament before going their separate ways. Years later in high school, Haruka reunites with Makoto and Nagisa, but Rin has changed and now only cares about proving he is a better swimmer than Haruka. After this bitter reunion, Haruka, Makoto and Nagisa decide to form a new swim team called the Iwatobi High School Swim Club, bringing in Rei Ryuugazaki as their fourth member. The newly formed team trains hard with the goal of competing together in an upcoming tournament, reconnecting through their shared love of swimming, and hoping to settle the rivalry between Haruka and Rin. Along the way, the four teammates develop a strong bond of friendship.",
