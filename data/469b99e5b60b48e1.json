    "text": "Kotaro is an ordinary elementary school boy living with his father after the tragic death of his mother in a car accident. His simple life is upended when Misha, an apprentice angel with boundless energy, decides to befriend him out of the blue. Misha is joined by Kotaro's kindhearted demon classmate Shia, his cat-like friend Koboshi, and fellow student Takashi. Despite her good intentions, Misha's attempts to help often backfire, landing the group in amusing misadventures. Over time, the angel, demon, and humans form a close bond, with the girls possibly developing crushes on Kotaro. In addition to their antics, Kotaro deals with normal childhood experiences like school pressures. He also takes on some household responsibilities like cooking and cleaning since it's just him and his dad. Through laughter, friendship, and love, Kotaro, Misha and their supernatural friends learn to find joy in life's strange occurrences. Their lighthearted exploits offer a respite from Kotaro's tragedy-filled past, giving hope for brighter days ahead.",
