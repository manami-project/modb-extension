  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takashi is your average boy, living a simple life with his father and navigating the pressures of education, until one day, his world is turned upside down by the arrival of Misha, an overly enthusiastic and cheerful junior high school student. Misha, who is an apprentice angel, has a peculiar tendency to shout rather than speak and has chosen Takashi as her friend, much to his dismay. Along with his school friends, including the kind-hearted demon Shia and the cat-like Koboshi, Takashi finds himself embroiled in all sorts of adventures and troubles, as Misha's persistent and somewhat stalker-ish behavior leads to unexpected and often hilarious situations. Despite the chaos that surrounds him, Takashi must also deal with the responsibilities of cooking and cleaning at home, as he embarks on a journey of laughs, love, and self-discovery. Based on the manga by Koge-Donbo, this anime is a heartwarming and entertaining exploration of friendship and the supernatural.",
