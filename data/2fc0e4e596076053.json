    "text": "Ogaâ€™s reputation as the toughest juvenile delinquent in Ishiyama High, a school notorious for its delinquents, is unchallenged. His life takes a dramatic turn when he stumbles upon a mysterious man floating down a river, who splits in two to reveal a baby boy. This baby is no ordinary child, but the son of the Demon King, Beelzebub IV, and Oga is now responsible for raising him. The demon maid Hilda informs Oga that the baby has chosen him due to his incredible strength. To avoid Hilda's wrath and find a new guardian for Baby Beel, Oga must seek out someone stronger than him at his delinquent-filled school. With the help of his friends, Oga navigates the challenges of raising a demon child while trying to maintain his delinquent status. The fate of the world rests on Oga's shoulders as he attempts to find a suitable caretaker for the future Demon King.",
