    "text": "Takeshi's unpaid debt of 300,000 yen thrusts Kaiji Itou, a slacker with a penchant for petty crimes, into a treacherous world of high-stakes gambling. When the debt collector, Endou, pays Kaiji a visit, he offers him a chance to clear his compounded debt of 3.85 million yen. The catch? Kaiji must board a ship filled with other indebted individuals and participate in a series of perilous gambles, where the winners can clear their debts, but the losers face an even deeper financial abyss. Based on Nobuyuki Fukumoto's renowned manga series, this psychological thriller follows Kaiji as he navigates a dark underworld filled with mind games, deceit, and desperation, where the worst aspects of human nature emerge as people fight for survival. With his back against the wall, Kaiji must rely on his wits and courage to outmaneuver his ruthless adversaries and secure his financial freedom.",
