  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yamato and its crew are thrust into action as the universe faces catastrophic collisions in the year 2.203. Following the Bolar Federation's defeat at the hands of Desslok's Galman-Gamilon Empire, a subspace dimensional disruption has set a distant Red Galaxy on a collision course with the Milky Way. The Star Force is deployed to investigate the chaos, only to find Desslok's palace in ruins and the Galman-Gamilon homeworld devastated by colliding stars and planets. As they pay their respects, a massive red planet crashes into Galmania, forcing the Star Force to make a hasty escape.\n\nMeanwhile, Earth is under a new threat: Aquarius, a water world, is moving inexorably towards it, poised to flood the planet completely upon impact. The Dinguil, an alien race whose own homeworld has already been destroyed by Aquarius, are orchestrating this impending disaster. With humanity's survival hanging in the balance, the crew of the Yamato must stop Aquarius' destructive force and save Earth from a watery doom.",
