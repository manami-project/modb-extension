  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mirei's passionate kiss awakens Mamori Tokonome's latent power, turning her into a mighty sword that Mirei wields with grace and strength. Mamori, a naïve 16-year-old, finds herself on the artificial island of Mermaid after being kidnapped from her school. On this island, girls who are infected with the Armed Virus are sent to either survive or perish. The virus turns these girls into living weapons, and Mamori is no exception.\n\nMamori is paired with the enigmatic and buxom Mirei Shikishima, who becomes her protector and wielder. The two must navigate a world filled with danger, including the Wärter, a group that seeks to control the most powerful weapons. Mamori and Mirei want nothing to do with this organization and must find their own way home before the Wärter can capture them.\n\nAs they fight for their survival, Mamori and Mirei grow closer, and their feelings for each other intensify. Together, they face off against other girls with superpowers, including the sadistic Charlotte, the gluttonous Meifon, and the erotic biker duo Lady Lady. With Mirei's strength and Mamori's power, they have a chance to make it off the island alive. But can Mamori handle the heat of battle and her growing feelings for Mirei? Only time will tell.",
