    "text": "His future was uncertain, but one invitation from his friend Taishi plunged Kazuki into the thrilling and chaotic world of fan comics, or doujinshi. Clueless and initially indifferent to manga and anime, Kazuki finds himself lost in a sea of cosplayers, artists, and enthusiasts at a massive comic convention. As he navigates through the challenges of creating and selling his own doujinshi, he discovers a new passion and a potential path to his destiny.\n\nWhile Taishi dreams of conquering the world with his manga, Kazuki is supported by a diverse group of friends: Yuu, a seasoned doujinshi artist; Eimi, a successful but arrogant mangaka; and Mizuki, Kazuki's childhood friend who is less than thrilled about his newfound hobby. As Kazuki delves deeper into the world of doujinshi, he must overcome numerous obstacles, from brainstorming ideas to printing his manga. Will he succeed in his new career as a doujinshi artist, or will the pressures of this unique world prove too much for him to handle? Join Kazuki on his hilarious and heartwarming journey in \"Comic Party,\" where ambition, friendship, and love collide in the whirlwind world of fan comics.",
