  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Stranger by the Shore is a love story between two young men who meet on an island off the coast of Okinawa. Shun Hashimoto, an openly gay aspiring novelist, moved to the island three years ago after being abandoned by his angry family when he came out to them. There, he has been living with his grandmother and trying to build a new life. One day, Shun notices Mio Chibana, a somber high school student who often sits alone on the beach, grieving over his recently deceased parents. Shun reaches out to Mio, and the two start spending time together, gradually growing closer. However, just as Mio begins to move past his grief, he is sent away to an orphanage on the mainland. Three years later, 20-year-old Mio returns to confess his romantic feelings to Shun. But after years without contact, Shun is reluctant to let Mio back into his heart so easily. As shadows from Shun's past threaten to resurface, his budding relationship with Mio faces even more complications. This is a bittersweet story about two young men finding solace in each other, only to be separated by life's circumstances. It explores themes of grief, acceptance, and the courage it takes to pursue an unconventional romance.",
