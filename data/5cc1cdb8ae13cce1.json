Despite her timid nature, Monaka becomes a cold and calculating killer when she receives an assignment.\n\nYears ago, another killer named Sawa vanished after avenging her parents' death. Now, Monaka carries on the legacy of the Angel of Death, taking down the city's worst criminals. But when her father's space mission goes awry, an unexpected evil descends upon the city. As the Angel of Death, Monaka must face her toughest challenge yet, one that will test her resolve and hit close to home.
