    "text": "Set in 19th century France, this anime tells the tragic story of Fantine and her young daughter Cosette. As a struggling single mother, Fantine faces immense hardship in finding work and a place to call home. When she hears of possible prosperity in the big city, she makes the difficult decision to leave Cosette with acquaintances, the Thenardiers, believing they will care for her while Fantine earns money. But the Thenardiers reveal their cruel nature, treating Cosette as an indentured servant and pocketing Fantine's payments. Both mother and child endure years of suffering, clinging to the hope they'll be reunited. One night while running errands, a miserable Cosette crosses paths with Jean Valjean, the kind mayor of a nearby town. Moved by her plight, he rescues Cosette from her tormentors. Under Jean's guidance, Cosette enjoys the first tastes of freedom - promising to one day help others as she's been helped. But with the French Revolution's aftermath still plaguing the land, the road ahead remains filled with tragedy. This steadfast young girl seeks to heal her nation, vowing that none should suffer as she has until France is freed from poverty and hardship.",
