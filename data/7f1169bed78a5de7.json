  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiyoko, a high school girl with a passion for art, finds herself in a dystopian future where civilization has crumbled and society has lost its vibrancy. When her father tries to discard her mother's cherished drawings and discourages her artistic dreams, she decides to run away from home. Hiyoko discovers a makeshift community called The Asylum, established in an abandoned stadium and inhabited by gifted young individuals, including the enigmatic Akira.\n\nAs the corrupt police and greedy officials conspire to demolish the stadium to beautify the city, the residents of The Asylum devise a plan to resist. Instead of resorting to violence, they decide to create a street-art festival known as The Asylum Session, using their artistic talents to win the hearts and minds of the people. Hiyoko takes charge of creating a massive painting on the stadium, ultimately finding her purpose and a place where she truly belongs.",
