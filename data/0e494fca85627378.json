  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Deciding to restore the fractured harmony between humans and demons (youkai), the Buddhist monk Genjo Sanzo embarks on a perilous journey to the west alongside his three extraordinary companions. Their mission is to prevent the resurrection of Gyumao, an evil demon notorious for conducting twisted experiments that fuse human science with youkai magic, causing chaos and madness among demons.\n\nTo achieve this, Sanzo must deliver the sacred Maten Scripture to India, and he's joined by a diverse group of allies: Son Goku, a 500-year-old demon; Sha Gojyo, a half-demon, half-human with striking red eyes; and Cho Hakkai, a former school teacher turned demon. As they traverse through small towns and inns, they confront various youkai, protect townspeople, and face unpredictable challenges.\n\nOne fateful night at an inn, two youkai attack the waitress, and Gojyo leaps into action with his companions to save her. Hailed as heroes, they remain unaware that their courageous deeds have caught the attention of someone with a destiny-altering plan for them. The road to India is filled with danger, but together, they must press on to save the world from Gyumao's sinister grasp.",
