  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aya's teacher, Tairaku, leads a seemingly charmed life: a respectable teaching job, a lovely colleague he hopes to wed, and the affections of his beautiful student, Aya. His fortune only seems to grow when Aya's doting father, a powerful crime lord, entrusts her to Tairaku's care, allowing her to live with him. However, this new arrangement comes with a dangerous catch: Tairaku must safeguard Aya's purity, lest he face the wrath of her ruthless father.\n\nAs Aya frequently tempts Tairaku with her provocative behavior, the teacher finds himself in a precarious balancing act. Not only must he resist her advances, but he must also shield her from the unwanted attention of others at school, all while keeping their living situation a secret from his fellow educators. Failure in any of these tasks could result in dire consequences, from losing his job to facing the deadly repercussions of crossing a mob boss. Despite these challenges, Tairaku remains determined to protect Aya and navigate the treacherous waters of his new reality.",
