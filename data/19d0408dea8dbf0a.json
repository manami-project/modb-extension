    "text": "Shinn, a young and resilient captain, leads a squadron of young individuals known as the Eighty-Six, who are deemed less than human and forced to pilot 'unmanned' combat drones in a war against the autonomous Legion drones of the Giadian Empire. Meanwhile, Lena, a compassionate and determined military officer, commands the squadron from a safe distance, striving to treat the Eighty-Six with the humanity they deserve. As the two navigate the brutal realities of a war hidden behind government propaganda, their fates intertwine, igniting a tale of hope, despair, and the unwavering will to survive in a world that has forsaken them.",
