  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around Sakai Yuuji, an ordinary high school student whose life is abruptly changed when he is attacked by a monster called a \"Crimson Denizen.\" These creatures originate from a parallel universe and feed on human life energy. During the attack, Yuuji is saved by a sword-wielding girl with flaming red hair who calls herself a \"Flame Haze.\" She informs Yuuji that he has already been killed and is now a \"Torch,\" a mere residue of his former self that will soon cease to exist. As they talk, Yuuji discovers a faint blue flame in his chest representing his dwindling life force. He also learns that his friend has become a Torch as well and has even less time left than him. Yuuji grapples with the reality of his imminent demise as a Torch while joining forces with the Flame Haze girl to fight against the predatory Crimson Denizens. He strives to find meaning and purpose while confronting the creatures threatening humanity during what little remains of his transient existence. Ultimately, Yuuji must determine how to make the most of his borrowed time before he fades into oblivion.",
