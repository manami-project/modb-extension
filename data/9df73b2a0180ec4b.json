One fateful night, a group of nine Kisaragi students gather to bid farewell to a friend, performing a friendship ritual using paper charms. Unbeknownst to them, these charms are linked to the haunted past of Heavenly Host. A sudden earthquake transports them to an alternate dimension where the demolished school still stands, now a playground for vengeful spirits. Trapped in this terrifying realm, the students must unravel the chilling mysteries of the past, work together to escape, or risk joining the ranks of the damned forever. \"Corpse Party: Tortured Souls - Bougyakusareta Tamashii no Jukyou\" is a gripping tale of redemption, sacrifice, and the unsettling truth that the past is never far behind. This anime serves a thrilling experience for mystery enthusiasts, horror fans, and those with a stomach for gore.",
