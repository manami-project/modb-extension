    "text": "Delicious meals and peaceful days are the order of the season in Fuyuki City, as the Emiya family and their Servants find themselves far removed from the Holy Grail War. Shirou Emiya, now a master of modern cuisine, takes center stage in the kitchen, crafting mouth-watering dishes for his household. With each changing season, the Emiya dinner table is graced with delightful meals that bring everyone together.\n\nAs Shirou and Artoria return from the market with fresh ingredients, the anticipation builds for the culinary creations that await. Illya and Taiga find comfort under the kotatsu, while Cú and Medusa join in for a relaxing time. Even Rin gets a taste of luxury as her Servant whips up a lavish feast.\n\nBut the Emiya family's reputation for fine dining has spread, drawing unexpected guests to their doorstep. As Shirou meticulously prepares dishes like his succulent foil-baked salmon and delectable bamboo shoot gratin, the living room fills with laughter and camaraderie. In this gentle world where Fate meets food, there's always a seat at the table and a satisfying meal to share. Bon appétit!",
