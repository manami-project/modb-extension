Sitting next to Ayaka in class and sharing the same bus every morning, Honoka's only concern had been navigating the treacherous waters of her fan club's jealousy. Little did he know that Ayaka's true purpose in life was to shield him from harm, a secret she kept hidden until the day a falling school building forced her to reveal her magical powers.\n\nAs Honoka delves deeper into Ayaka's world, he learns that she is not the only witch in their midst, and that many of his classmates harbor their own supernatural secrets. Caught in the crossfire of a hidden war between the Workshop Witches and the Tower Witches, Honoka must now balance his mundane school life with the fantastical world of magic, all while trying to understand the true nature of the power hidden within him.
