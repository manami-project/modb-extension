  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2060, enormous space stations orbit Earth, one of which is the resort-like \"Spacestation No. 9\". A woman driving a flashy pink car arrives, only to get into a collision with another vehicle. Irked, she impulsively gives chase at dangerous speeds through the busy space metropolis. Her pursuit eventually leads to an unexpected destination - a fashion show runway. This fast-paced, music-backed anime short is the second animated video produced for the electronic band capsule's NEXUS-2060 concept about future space tourism. Directed by renowned anime talent Yoshiyuki Momose and released in 2005, its retro-futuristic setting and eccentric characters capture the spirit of space age pop culture. With its blend of sci-fi, action and style, this anime promises a wild intergalactic ride.",
