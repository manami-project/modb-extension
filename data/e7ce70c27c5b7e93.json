    "text": "A young girl named Aki spends a summer day with her beloved Ryukyu dog Goyapochi while her mother is hospitalized. Though tinged with sadness, Aki finds comfort in her canine companion. This slice-of-life animated short depicts a quiet moment of companionship against the backdrop of a difficult family situation. Created by director Akino Fukuji in 2017 during her first year at the Tokyo University of the Arts, the film features evocative music by Kazuyuki Negishi and skillful sound design by Asuka Kanezawa and Airi Furukawa. Produced under Mitsuko Okamoto, it offers a glimpse into the Geidai Animation program through one student's personal story.",
