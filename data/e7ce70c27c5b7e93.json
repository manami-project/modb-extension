    "text": "Sound the melancholic chimes of a summer tainted with sorrow, as Aki-chan's world turns upside down with her mother's hospitalization. Amidst the emotional turmoil, her loyal Ryukyu dog, Goyapochi, stands as her steadfast companion. This poignant tale, brought to life by the talented first-year students of the 2017 Tokyo University of the Arts' Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation, is skillfully directed by Akino FUKUJI. The hauntingly beautiful music by Kazuyuki NEGISHI and immersive sound design by Asuka KANEZAWA and Airi FURUKAWA, under the watchful eye of producer Mitsuko OKAMOTO, create a heartrending anime experience that will resonate with your soul.
