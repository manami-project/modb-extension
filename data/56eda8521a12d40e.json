  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Maquia is a member of the Iolph, a gentle race of weavers who stop aging in their youth and live for centuries. Though surrounded by her people, Maquia has felt lonely since the loss of her parents at a young age. Her people live peacefully, isolated from the outside world, until the kingdom of Mesarte invades seeking the secret of the Iolph's longevity. In the attack, Maquia's friends are captured or killed, and she escapes into the wilderness, now truly alone. There Maquia discovers an orphaned human baby boy and chooses to raise him, naming him Ariel. As Ariel grows up much faster than Maquia, she struggles to adapt to the human world she knows little about. Still, Maquia is determined to care for him despite the vast difference in their lifespans, forging an unlikely family between two lonely souls against a backdrop of prejudice. As Ariel comes of age, Maquia must reconcile her eternal youthfulness with Ariel's mortality, finding solace in each other even as the threads of tragedy that bind them begin to show.",
