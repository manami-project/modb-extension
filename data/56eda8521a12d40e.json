  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Their serene existence defined by ageless youth and the intricate weaving of life's tales into the Hibiol cloth, the Iolph dwell in peaceful isolation from the human realm. Among them is Maquia, an orphaned Iolph girl who, despite being cherished by her community, harbors an inexplicable sense of solitude. When the tranquility of their sanctuary is disrupted by the invading Mesarte army, driven by the greed for the secret to the Iolph's eternal youth, Maquia finds herself separated from her loved ones and thrust into the unfamiliar world of humans.\n\nIn the midst of her despair, Maquia discovers an orphaned human infant, Ariel, whose vulnerability resonates with her own. She takes him under her wing, embarking on a journey as a mother while grappling with the stark contrast between their respective lifespans. As Ariel grows and the world around them evolves, Maquia's bond with him deepens, even as it is tested by the relentless march of time and the escalating tensions between the Iolph and the Mesarte.\n\nThis is a poignant tale of love, loss, and the unbreakable bond between two lonely souls, woven together by fate against the backdrop of a timeless struggle.",
