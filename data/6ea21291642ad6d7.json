  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wang Lu, a 12-year-old boy with an extraordinary soul that only appears once in a millennium, embarks on a journey to become an exceptional sage in the world of Reikenzan. The story unfolds in the nine provinces of Kyushu, where a prophecy foretold that falling comets would deplete the spiritual energies of the heavens and earth, leading to an age of chaos. However, the comets passed without incident, leaving behind a newborn boy named Ouriku, whose soul was mysteriously touched by the cosmic event.\n\nTwelve years later, the memories of the comets have faded, and the prestigious Reiken clan announces an entrance examination to find the most gifted and powerful disciples to train as sages. Seizing the opportunity, Wang Lu, also known as Ouriku, and his servant Ouchou set off for the examination site. Unbeknownst to them, the organizer, Oubu, is notorious for her unpredictable and carefree nature, making the trials anything but ordinary.\n\nReikenzan: Hoshikuzu-tachi no Utage follows Wang Lu's adventures as he navigates the unpredictable challenges set before him, aiming to become a powerful sage and uncover the truth behind his unique soul. With a rich history and a legacy of producing first-class martial arts talent, the Reiken clan's grand tournament promises laughter, excitement, and unexpected twists.",
