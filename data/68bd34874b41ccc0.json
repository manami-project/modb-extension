    "text": "An enchanting tale of resilience and relevance unfolds in this traditionally animated film, inspired by a beloved picture book by Agawa Hiroyuki and Okabe Fuyuhiko, first published in 1959. The narrative revolves around an aging steam locomotive, D51 Yaemon, once a celebrated figure in the world of transportation. However, with the advent of modern technology, the once-revered engine finds itself struggling to maintain its utility amidst a sea of advanced counterparts.\n\nAs the cityscape evolves, the old steam engine becomes a symbol of the past, viewed by its contemporaries as nothing more than an inconvenience, causing mishaps and delays. With the threat of being scrapped looming large, the old locomotive faces an uphill battle to prove its worth. Can it manage to evade this unfortunate destiny and reclaim its former glory?\n\nThis heartwarming tale, adapted from a popular children's book series, promises to captivate audiences with its timeless themes and endearing characters.",
