  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the information provided, this anime centers around two teams - Team Fawn and Team Rabbit. Team Fawn is comprised of students from Gurantseere Academy who aspire to one day fight alongside the heroic Team Rabbit. The story seems to take place in a world where conflicts arise, as referenced by a GDF (potentially some kind of defense force or military entity) launching attacks. During one such attack, Team Fawn finally gets the opportunity to fight alongside Team Rabbit, fulfilling their dreams. Additionally, this anime originally aired in 2013 as a TV series. An all-new 25th episode has been produced which will bridge the story of the original series to an upcoming film project. This new episode will air at the conclusion of a re-broadcast of the 2013 TV series scheduled for July. Overall, the anime follows a group of aspirational students who idolize an established team of heroes. When conflict strikes, the students finally get to stand alongside their heroes, while a new episode and film project aim to continue the story years after the initial TV series aired.",
