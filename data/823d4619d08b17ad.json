  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the distant future, the city of Transbaal was founded on the planet Celdar under the affiliation of Planet Transbaal. There, the Transbaal Army forms an elite squadron called the Rune Angels, consisting of five talented but unruly female pilots - Apricot, Kahlua, Lily, Anise, and Nano-Nano. Ditzy Apricot gains superhuman strength when touched by a man, while flirtatious Kahlua sometimes transforms into her wild alter-ego Tequila. Swordswoman Lily believes in fairness even when dividing desserts, tomboyish Anise loves tinkering with machines, and cat-like Nano-Nano rounds out the crew. Charged with locating Lost Technology and keeping peace on Planet Transbaal, the Rune Angels take on various missions - some mundane, others bizarre. Whether capturing the masochistic Baron Garret, gathering ingredients for a legendary space hot pot, or braving department store sales, no task is too absurd or challenging for these chaotic but capable Angels! Though often causing trouble, they work together to complete their assignments in their own unique way.",
