    "text": "Revered as protectors of Tristain, Louise, a once dismissed mage, and her familiar, Saito, face mounting pressure to continue safeguarding the realm. With war looming, the newly crowned Queen Henrietta grapples with political turmoil while a sinister figure lurks in the shadows, plotting against the monarchy. As the students of Tristain Magic Academy brace for imminent conflict, Louise's mastery of the enigmatic Void Magic, gifted by Henrietta, could be the key to their survival. However, harnessing this power poses its own challenges. As tensions rise and loyalties are tested, Louise and Saito must stand united to protect their friends and kingdom. Meanwhile, Saito finds himself caught between his duty to Louise and his wandering eye, risking the wrath of her infamous jealousy.
