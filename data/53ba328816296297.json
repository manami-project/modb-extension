  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Amachi, Yuzuki, Nekomiya, and Yuki, four inseparable friends, bid farewell to their cherished Mochitsuki Academy, vowing to reunite three years later at the very spot where they buried a time capsule filled with memories. As time elapses, each friend is transferred to a new school, and the group drifts apart.\n\nThree years later, the fateful day arrives, and the friends gather at their now-deserted alma mater. However, their excitement is short-lived as they discover their time capsule's contents have been mysteriously removed by one of their former teachers. In its place, they find a clue that sets them on a nostalgic scavenger hunt throughout the school.\n\nAs they search for their lost memories, they reminisce about their shared past, rekindling old feelings and rediscovering the bonds that once brought them together. The journey through their abandoned school grounds not only holds the key to their hidden time capsule but also to the reunion of their once-unbreakable friendship.",
