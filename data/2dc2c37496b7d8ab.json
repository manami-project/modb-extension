  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Facing the briny air of Okinawa, Kaori and her friends eagerly anticipated a tranquil post-graduation getaway. Instead, they stumbled upon a grotesque stench and a horrifying sight: fish with mechanical appendages, crawling out of the sea, harbingers of a terrifying transformation in the local wildlife. When Kaori's fianc√©, Tadashi, calls from Tokyo, the severity of the situation becomes clear as he, too, falls victim to these mechanized creatures.\n\nDetermined and resilient, Kaori embarks on a treacherous journey to uncover Tadashi's fate, accompanied by Shirakawa, a videographer with a thirst for the truth behind this epidemic. As they traverse a world teetering on the edge of chaos, they confront the source of these monstrous fish: a sinister, unknown entity that has unleashed a contagion capable of altering both animal and human life.\n\nAmidst the carnage, Kaori must navigate the urban battlefield of Tokyo, overcoming nightmarish creatures such as four-legged sharks and machine-driven squid. As the stench of death permeates the air, Kaori's resolve is tested, but her love for Tadashi and the pursuit of truth drive her forward into the heart of this unimaginable evil.",
