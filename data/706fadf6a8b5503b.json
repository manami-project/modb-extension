  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A year after the disbandment of SCEPTER 4, the underground community falls under the unofficial jurisdiction of the volatile Red Clan HOMRA and its unstable leader, Mikoto Suoh. Burdened by his destructive power, Suoh grows increasingly erratic in his attempts to maintain control. Meanwhile, Reisi Munakata is chosen to inherit the mantle of the Blue King. Embracing his new authority, Munakata rebuilds SCEPTER 4 and sets his sights on the chaotic threat posed by HOMRA and Suoh. When these two kings finally cross paths, their ideological clash sparks a new conflict in the ongoing saga of the seven kings. With Munakata determined to eliminate dangers to public safety and Suoh barely keeping his power in check, the two seem set on an inevitable collision course.",
