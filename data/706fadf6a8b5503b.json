    "text": "Dresden Slate appoints Reisi Munakata as the new Blue King, a year after the disbandment of the Blue Clan SCEPTER 4 and the subsequent rise of the Red Clan HOMRA, who now reigns over the underground community. However, the constant struggle to contain his formidable power has left the Red King, Mikoto Suoh, teetering on the brink of instability.\n\nEmbracing his new role, Munakata seizes the opportunity to rebuild SCEPTER 4 and hones his newfound abilities as a king. Convinced that Mikoto Suoh and HOMRA pose a significant threat to global security, he sets his sights on confronting them.\n\nThe first encounter between these two young and powerful kings ignites a fresh conflict in the epic saga of the seven kings, promising a thrilling and intense battle that awaits.",
