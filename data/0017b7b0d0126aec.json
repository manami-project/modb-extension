    "text": "To embark on a perilous journey filled with enchantment and danger, meet Olivier, a courageous young priest who defies the constraints of his Vasaria order. The destination: a forbidden island known only as 'G', shrouded in fear and mystery, where the mere mention of its name is considered a curse. Legend has it that the island is the sanctuary of Gestalt, a powerful deity who once rebelled against the supreme god Salsaroa, casting the world into darkness.\n\nOlivier's life takes a dramatic turn when he saves a young mute girl from a life of slavery. Little does he know that this girl, Ohri, is a skilled sorceress who becomes his steadfast companion on the journey to 'G'. But the path is treacherous, as the head of the order sends a dark elf named Suzu to bring Olivier back.\n\nAs the journey unfolds, Olivier and Ohri face a myriad of challenges, from encounters with monstrous creatures to confrontations with powerful magic-users. But with each obstacle, they grow stronger, forging alliances and uncovering secrets that will change their lives forever.\n\nJoin Olivier and Ohri as they navigate through a world of danger and intrigue, where the stakes are high, and the truth about the forbidden island and the fallen god could change everything!",
