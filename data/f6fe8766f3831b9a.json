  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ever since he was a child, Kogarashi Fuyuzora has been plagued by spirits, leading to a life filled with debt and homelessness. However, his spiritual abilities have also taught him how to defend himself against malevolent entities. In search of affordable accommodation, Kogarashi stumbles upon Yuragi Inn, a former hot springs inn turned boarding house. The inn, now home to a bevy of beautiful women, is rumored to be haunted, which explains the low rent. Undeterred by the supernatural rumors, Kogarashi moves in, only to discover that the ghost haunting the inn is a young girl named Yuuna. Despite his initial plan to exorcise the ghost, Kogarashi finds himself unable to harm Yuuna and instead vows to help her uncover her unfinished business and move on to the afterlife. As he delves deeper into the mysteries of Yuragi Inn, Kogarashi uncovers the supernatural secrets of his fellow tenants, leading to a life far from the ordinary high school experience he had hoped for.",
