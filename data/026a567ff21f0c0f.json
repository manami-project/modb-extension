  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the adventures of the Straw Hat pirate crew aboard their ship, the Going Merry. As revealed through flashbacks, the Going Merry is not simply a ship to the crew - it is a beloved and irreplaceable friend. When the Going Merry becomes damaged beyond repair, it causes conflict amongst the crew, specifically between Luffy and Usopp. Usopp goes so far as to temporarily leave the crew over his devotion to the ship. Meanwhile, Robin mysteriously disappears after being abducted by the deadly government organization CP9. In an effort to rescue Robin and bring the fractured crew back together, Luffy and the remaining Straw Hats embark on a dangerous mission to stand up to the World Government forces that took her. Along the way, they reminisce about their unforgettable voyages aboard the Going Merry before being forced to ultimately bid farewell to their companion. Through newly animated recreations of treasured moments between the pirates and their ship, the anime promises an emotional look back at the inseparable bond between the Straw Hat crew and the Going Merry as they sailed in pursuit of the legendary One Piece treasure.",
