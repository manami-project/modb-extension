  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Heppoko Jikken Animation Excelâ™¥Saga is an eccentric and absurd parody of anime that follows the chaotic life of Excel, an overzealous and devoted member of the secret organization ACROSS. Led by the mysterious Il Palazzo, ACROSS aims to dominate the world, starting with the City of F in F Prefecture. Excel, along with her fragile partner Hyatt, embarks on a series of bizarre and hilarious missions, ranging from understanding bowling to battling alien invaders. As they stumble through their assignments, they encounter a diverse cast of characters, including three unemployed bachelors, a Mexican immigrant worker, and the Grand Will of the Macrocosm. With its unique blend of comedy, satire, and non-stop action, Excel Saga is a wild ride that pokes fun at anime tropes and keeps viewers entertained from start to finish.",
