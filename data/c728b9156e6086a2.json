  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nobi Nobita, a boy plagued by misfortune, has inadvertently left his future descendants in a state of poverty due to his mishaps in the 20th century. In a desperate attempt to improve their social standing, the Nobi family sends their robotic feline servant, Doraemon, back in time to steer Nobita towards a more prosperous path. Despite being a dysfunctional robot acquired by the family through a fortuitous accident, Doraemon embarks on a series of adventures with Nobita, aiming to improve his life with futuristic, almost magical gadgets. However, their efforts often result in unexpected complications, leaving one to wonder if Doraemon's intervention has truly made Nobita's life better. Joined by their friends Sneech, Sue, and Gian, the group navigates through these challenges together. Unfortunately, the series has suffered significant loss, with most footage destroyed in a fire after its cancellation. Only the opening and closing credits, audio from several episodes, and still images from episodes 1 and 24 have managed to survive.",
