  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a former convict, known as Yotaro, is released from prison during Japan's Shouwa Genroku era, he is captivated by the performance of 'Shinigami' by the legendary rakugo master, Yakumo VIII. Inspired to turn his life around, Yotaro seeks out Yakumo and, against all odds, is accepted as his apprentice. As he moves into Yakumo's home, Yotaro finds himself immersed in the world of rakugo, a traditional form of comic storytelling.\n\nHowever, Yotaro's journey is far from straightforward. Yakumo, a complex and difficult man, harbors a dark past that he shares with his ward, Konatsu, a fiery young woman whose father was also a renowned storyteller. Yakumo's refusal to train Konatsu, fueled by his belief that rakugo is no place for women, leads to a deep-seated resentment, with Konatsu vowing to kill him, accusing Yakumo of her father's murder.\n\nAs Yotaro navigates the intricate world of rakugo under Yakumo's tutelage, he must also confront the master's troubled past, which unfolds throughout the season, revealing tales from World War II and the years that followed. This compelling narrative explores the art of rakugo, the complexities of human relationships, and the power of redemption.",
