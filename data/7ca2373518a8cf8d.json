    "text": "Mameshiba is a series of animated shorts featuring anthropomorphic bean characters called \"Mameshiba.\" The shorts showcase various Mameshiba in silly situations while also conveying trivia and facts. Several assorted Mameshiba shorts fall outside the regular episodes or new series collaborations. These include holiday-themed shorts like \"Mamerry Christmas-hen,\" showing Mameshiba Christmas caroling in claymation style. \"5-Shuunen Party-hen\" commemorates the 5th anniversary of Mameshiba, also using claymation. In \"Sakamichi Korokoro-hen,\" Mameshiba simply roll down a hill. \"Kansatsu-hen\" features Mameshiba being observed under a magnifying glass. There are also musical shorts to promote Mameshiba, like the \"Music Clip\" video for the YouTube channel launch. Additional shorts convey more trivia through songs or celebrate holidays like Halloween and Christmas. Some shorts introduce new characters like Panda Mameshiba. But the silly and educational spirit of Mameshiba shines through in all these assorted shorts.",
