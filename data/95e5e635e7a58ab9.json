  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Minami Hokuto, performing under the name hitomi, released a video that served as the inspiration for the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha anime series. The video was part of a merchandise CD titled Triangle Heart ~Lyrical Toy Box~, which was released on June 29, 2001, for the eroge video game Triangle Heart 3. The CD featured a variety of fan material, including several visual novel-like stories known as 'mini-scenarios'. One of these mini-scenarios, titled 'Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha', cast Nanoha Takamachi, a minor character in the Triangle Heart 3 canon, as a magical girl. This mini-scenario served as a prototype for the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha anime series. The video is also considered the fourth episode of the 'Triangle Heart ~Sweet Songs Forever~ Sound Stage VA' video collection, further solidifying its connection to the Triangle Hearts 3 game.",
