  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lyrical Toy Box is a merchandise CD released in 2001 for the visual novel game Triangle Heart 3. It contains several short stories featuring characters from the game, including one called \"Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha.\" This story focuses on Nanoha Takamachi, originally a minor character, reimagined as a magical girl. It served as the prototype and inspiration for the Magical Girl Lyrical Nanoha anime series that would later be developed. The CD also includes a music video performed by voice actress Hitomi under the name Minami Hokuto. This video features Nanoha in magical girl form and introduces key elements that would carry over to the Nanoha anime, like her magical staff Raising Heart. Overall, while intended as supplemental fan material for Triangle Heart 3, the \"Lyrical Nanoha\" story and music video on this CD laid the groundwork for the popular Nanoha franchise. By recasting a side character in a new magical girl role, the creators found the spark that would eventually evolve into a successful standalone series.",
