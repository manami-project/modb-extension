  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takumi Kaizu is a high school student who has never had much romantic interest in girls, even though he is surrounded by potential love interests like his childhood friend Konami, his classmate Shino, and popular student Wakana. However, when his best friend Osamu asks Takumi during a school trip if there is any girl he loves, it sparks an awareness in Takumi about his feelings. Although girls have always been around him, Takumi realizes he has never truly paid attention before to see if he has deeper feelings for any of them. Seeing Osamu desperately try to get a girlfriend makes Takumi anxious as well. He decides he wants to sort out his own feelings and find a girlfriend before his final year of high school is over. With the last summer of high school approaching, Takumi resolves to explore his relationships with the girls around him more deeply. Will he discover requited love from his childhood friend Konami, sympathetic classmate Shino, admired school idol Wakana, or someone else entirely?",
