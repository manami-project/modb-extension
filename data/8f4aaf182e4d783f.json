    "text": "Ichijou Nozomu, a junior high school student, finds himself back in his childhood hometown after his father's job takes him overseas. Instead of accompanying his father, Nozomu decides to live with his aunt and attend high school in this quaint, yet peculiar town. Known for its unusually high number of twin births, the town is steeped in a legend of twin girls who fell in love with the same man and transformed into birds, taking flight together. As Nozomu navigates his new life, he encounters several pairs of twins, including his own aunt's daughters and the captivating Sakurazuki and Ichijou sisters. Caught in a whirlwind of twin affection, Nozomu must juggle the affections of his new admirers while also dealing with the mischievous antics of a goat named Billy, ultimately striving to win the hearts of both old and new friends.",
