  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The kingdom of Segua has been embroiled in a long and bitter war against their rivals, the Ninterdo Empire, over control of the continent of Consume. Despite fighting valiantly, Segua has been steadily losing ground to Ninterdo's forces. The tides begin to turn, however, with the sudden appearance of Gear, a quick-footed young man with distinctive blue eyes. Inspired to join the struggle after the death of his friend, Gear lends his phenomenal speed and bravery to the Segua cause. With Gear fighting by their side, Segua finally glimpses hope of reclaiming lost territory and pride. Gear is joined in his crusade by an eclectic band of comrades – his fierce sister Nel, the skilled archer Opal, and the lecherous but loyal Tejirof. Though outnumbered, these parody characters – echoes of legendary video game heroes – just may be able to turn the tide of war through courage, camaraderie, and a liberal dose of humor.",
