    "text": "Verta the green snake demon finds herself trapped in a modern city called Shura, a prison for supernatural creatures from across time. Separated from her sister Blanca, Verta aims to rescue her from captivity by the demon-slaying monk Fahai. In this strange city, Verta encounters other imprisoned beings - a clan of ox warriors spreading chaos as well as a fox demon offering her freedom in exchange for her memories. She also meets a mysterious amnesiac man who could aid her quest. Facing scarce options, Verta knows she must find a way to outwit her captors and overcome the monk Fahai's power in order to save her sister Blanca. Though her own magical abilities seem dampened in this realm, Verta persists in plotting her escape from this dystopia.",
