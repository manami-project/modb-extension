Blessed with psychic abilities but discontented with their ordinary lives, the trio finds themselves in an unfamiliar world brimming with excitement and high-stakes games.\n\nUpon arrival, they are greeted by Kurousagi, who introduces them to the Gift Games, a series of contests where participants wager their unique abilities for extraordinary rewards. To partake, they must join a community, and Kurousagi's 'No Names' community, having lost its prestige and land to a demon lord, is in dire need of their assistance.\n\nIn this parallel universe where reality intertwines with myth, the trio embarks on a mission to restore the dignity of their new home, eager to protect its inhabitants and explore the thrilling possibilities that Little Garden offers.
