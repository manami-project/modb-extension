  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Determined not to abandon a lost egg she discovers, a female Maiasaura takes it under her wing, raising the hatchling alongside her own offspring. To the astonishment of her herd, the new addition turns out to be a Tyrannosaurus, a carnivorous species. Unfazed, she names him Heart and chooses to raise both her children in isolation. Heart grows up alongside his herbivorous sibling, Light, but as he matures, he grapples with his predatory instincts and departs to explore his true nature. Years later, Heart encounters a newly hatched Ankylosaurus, who mistakenly assumes Heart to be his father. Despite his initial predatory inclinations, Heart finds himself unable to harm the newborn and instead, chooses to raise him, naming him Umasou, meaning 'delicious-looking'. As they navigate the harsh realities of their world, Heart and Umasou form an unlikely bond, mirroring Heart's own upbringing and challenging the boundaries between predator and prey.",
