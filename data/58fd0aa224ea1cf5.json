    "text": "In 21st century Japan, the existence of human-animal hybrids called \"Beastmen\" is revealed after centuries of secrecy. Michiru, an ordinary human girl, suddenly transforms into a tanuki Beastman and flees to Anima City, a refuge created 10 years prior where Beastmen can live openly without persecution. There Michiru meets Shirou, a wolf Beastman who harbors a deep mistrust of humans. As Shirou guides Michiru through the Beastmen community, they discover that Michiru's transformation was no accident. They get caught up in a conspiracy threatening the fragile peace between humans and Beastmen. Michiru and Shirou race to uncover the truth behind Michiru’s change and Anima City’s dark secrets. Their investigation tests the limits of coexistence while revealing the beauty and challenges of a hybrid society. Ultimately, the bonds they form with each other and the Beastmen community will determine Anima City’s future.",
