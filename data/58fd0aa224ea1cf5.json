  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the world enters the 21st century, a hidden facet of history comes to light: the existence of animal-humans. Living an ordinary human life, Michiru finds herself inexplicably transformed into a tanuki-human one day. Fleeing from her mundane life, she seeks solace in Anima City, a sanctuary established a decade ago for animal-humans to live openly and freely. In this haven, Michiru encounters Shirou, a wolf-human harboring a deep-seated animosity towards humans. As they navigate the trials, tribulations, and joys of the animal-human community together, Michiru and Shirou embark on a quest to unravel the mystery behind Michiru's sudden transformation. Their search for answers, however, entangles them in an unexpected and far-reaching incident.",
