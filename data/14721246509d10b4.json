  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zenopares, a colossal fleet of extraterrestrial invaders, embarks on a mission to conquer Earth, their new desired homeland. To combat this impending threat, three enigmatic space capsules, each containing a battleship and combat robot, were dispatched to Earth during the Edo Period. These capsules, buried beneath the surface, imparted their genetic code to select families, including the Kamui clan.\n\nFast forward to the 2000s, Zenopares arrives, and Earth's conventional weaponry proves futile against their advanced technology. As humanity faces imminent defeat, the chosen clans awaken to their destiny. Among them, Akira Kamui, his brother Ai, and their friend Kanna discover their family's hidden legacy: Tri-Zenon, a formidable mecha and one of the Zenon Guardians.\n\nThe siblings, initially driven by financial woes and the lure of a family treasure, find themselves thrust into a far greater conflict. As the battle for Earth unfolds in their city of Chitose, Akira, Ai, and Kanna must rise to the challenge and wield the power of Tri-Zenon to protect their planet from the invading Zenopares.",
