  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 1920s Italy, Marco Pagot was a celebrated World War I fighter pilot who was mysteriously cursed and transformed into an anthropomorphic pig named \"Porco Rosso\" (Red Pig). Now living a solitary life as a bounty hunter combating Adriatic Sea pirates, Porco occasionally visits his longtime friend Gina, who runs the Hotel Adriano. Porco soon finds himself with an American rival - the brash young pilot Donald Curtis who is also pursuing Gina's affection. After Curtis defeats Porco in aerial combat, Porco fakes his death to secretly repair his plane at Piccolo S.P.A. - an airplane factory run by the talented 17-year-old engineer Fio. With his improved aircraft, Porco returns to challenge Curtis and the pirates, hoping to protect the Adriatic, free Gina from Curtis' advances, and regain his lost honor. But with war looming over Europe, Porco may have to choose between his solitary existence and joining the coming battle to defend his country and friends.",
