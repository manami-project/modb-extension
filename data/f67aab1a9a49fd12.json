    "text": "Lady Oscar is raised as a man by her father, the Commander of the Royal Guard in pre-revolutionary France. An expert swordsman, she earns the prestigious position as bodyguard to the young Queen Marie Antoinette when she arrives from Austria to marry the French crown prince. However, tensions are rising as the lavish opulence of the nobility at Versailles contrasts harshly with the poverty of the common people. Selfish actions by Marie Antoinette lead to growing resentment amongst the starving masses. Oscar struggles between her duty and her compassion as she witnesses the injustice around her. Both Oscar and Marie Antoinette face conflict between their inner hearts and external pressures and expectations placed upon them by society. As Oscar serves her new queen, she grapples with her role amidst the complex schemes within the royal court and the tide of popular unrest sweeping France.",
