    "text": "Nakashima's latest collaboration, this anime unfolds in a world ravaged by fire thirty years ago, giving rise to a new race of flame-wielding mutants known as Burnish. The Burning Rescue fire department, equipped with cutting-edge technology, stands as the only line of defense against these destructive beings. Galo Thymos, a fiery new recruit, finds himself in a heated battle against Lio Fotia, the leader of a terrorist Burnish group, Mad Burnish. As the two clash, Galo uncovers the truth about the Burnish, forcing him to question everything he once believed. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Galo must navigate the blurred lines between good and evil in this action-packed, original anime.",
