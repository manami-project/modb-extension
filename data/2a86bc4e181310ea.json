  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hana Natori is a kind-hearted 25-year-old woman who agrees to secretly attend high school in place of her younger cousin, Kaho Miyoshi, who refuses to go. On Hana's first day, her former high school classmate, Okito Kanie, recognizes her. Kanie is now a teacher at the school. Though her cover is blown, Kanie decides not to reveal Hana's secret. Instead, he has his own plans to give her \"special lessons.\" As Hana continues to attend school, hijinks ensue from her trying to fit in as a student despite being much older than her classmates. She must also navigate her complex dynamic with Kanie, who holds power over her secret student identity. Through this comedic scenario of an adult woman forced back into high school, the story satirizes the Japanese education system and explores the roles people play at different stages of life. Ultimately, Hana rediscovers the youthfulness she lost as she embraces this second chance at adolescence.",
