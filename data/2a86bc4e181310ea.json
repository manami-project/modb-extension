With striking resemblance and a kind-hearted nature, Hana anticipates a smooth transition into high school life. However, her plans are quickly thwarted when her former classmate, Okito Kanie, now a history teacher at the school, uncovers her secret. Instead of exposing her, Kanie decides to give Hana a special lesson, marking the beginning of an unexpected journey filled with surprises and challenges.",
