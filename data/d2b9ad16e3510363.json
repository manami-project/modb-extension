    "text": "There's a young man named Zwei, who moves to a bustling city to kickstart a new chapter in his life. In a twist of fate, he lays his eyes on a captivating girl named Ein, who turns out to be a skilled assassin working for a shadowy organization called Inferno. Caught in the crosshairs, Zwei's heightened senses draw the attention of Ein's employers, leaving him with a chilling ultimatum: join their ranks as an assassin or become Ein's next target.\n\nIn a parallel account, Reiji, a young man with a similar background, stumbles upon a high-stakes assassination in Los Angeles. Abducted by the enigmatic Inferno, his memories are wiped clean, and he is given a choice: serve the organization or face death. Adopting a new identity as Zwei, he is paired with Inferno's top assassin, Ein, also known as 'Phantom.'\n\nAs they navigate the treacherous world of assassination together, Zwei and Ein find solace in each other amidst the bloodshed and violence. With no past to cling to and an uncertain future, they forge a bond that deepens with every mission they undertake.",
