    "text": "Taro Momoko Sakura, affectionately known as Chibi Maruko-chan, is a lively and mischievous 9-year-old girl living in a quaint little town. She shares her home with her parents, grandparents, and elder sister, and her daily life is filled with relatable and humorous escapades. Maruko-chan has a knack for playing pranks on her grandfather and big sister, and she often finds herself lost in thought over how to best spend her allowance. She has a strong dislike for sitting next to boys she deems unattractive in school.\n\nMaruko-chan is an avid fan of popular idol Momoe Yamaguchi and enjoys immersing herself in the world of manga. Her school life is enriched by a diverse group of friends, including her best friend Tama-chan, the student committee duo Maruo-kun and Migiwa-san, and the notorious B-class trio consisting of 'little master' Hanawa-kun, Hamaji-Bu Taro, and Sekiguchi-kun. This heartwarming anime captures the essence of childhood, presenting the simple yet delightful moments that make life worth living.",
