As peace finally seems within reach, a malevolent force awakens, determined to maintain the island's tumultuous status quo.\n\nA powerful witch, intent on preserving Lodoss by fomenting political discord among its kingdoms, stands as the new threat. Parn and his valiant companions must confront this menace, lest Lodoss descends once more into darkness and destruction. As dragons rule the skies and evil influences permeate the land, the fate of Lodoss rests in the hands of these six brave heroes. Their swords drawn, they embark on an epic journey to restore balance and save their homeland from the looming shadow of war.",
