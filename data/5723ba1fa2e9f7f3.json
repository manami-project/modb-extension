  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As God turned His back on the world, life persisted in a morbid limbo, with no new births and the deceased unable to find eternal peace. The world's last hope rests in the hands of 'gravekeepers' - divine beings with the ability to lay the restless dead to rest. In a small village, a young girl named Ai assumes the role of gravekeeper following her mother's demise. Her life takes a dark turn when a mysterious man, Hampnie Hambart, arrives and massacres the entire village, leaving Ai with no choice but to embark on a journey with the enigmatic stranger. As she travels across the desolate land, Ai continues to fulfill her duties as a gravekeeper, granting solace to the wandering dead while uncovering the truth behind God's abandonment and the world's tragic fate. In a realm where death has lost its meaning, could it be the only remaining salvation?",
