    "text": "Crimson flames ignite the battlefield once more as Yuji, who mysteriously vanished on the night he was to choose between a normal life and a supernatural one, reemerges as the enigmatic leader of the Bal Masqu√©. With his return, Yuji spearheads a questionable quest for universal peace, leading the Crimson Denizens in a conflict that threatens to engulf all supernatural beings.\n\nShana, the fiery warrior who once fought alongside Yuji, finds herself facing her most improbable foe. As she stands resolute against Yuji, Flame Hazes from around the world rally to her side, sparking a war that will ultimately determine the destiny of all supernatural kind.\n\nWhile Yuji's disappearance left behind no trace, Shana and Kazumi cling to the hope that the letters they sent him serve as proof of his continued existence. As they search for answers, the truth becomes undeniable: Yuji has returned, but not as the ally they once knew. In this explosive reunion, Shana must confront her most challenging adversary yet, setting the stage for a climactic battle that will leave fans on the edge of their seats.",
