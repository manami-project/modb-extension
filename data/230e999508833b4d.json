    "text": "A mysterious sleep illness called Randolph Syndrome has suddenly afflicted people across the world, causing them to fall into unending comas. Simultaneously, a massive subterranean realm dubbed \"Asylum\" was uncovered deep beneath Antarctica. This icy underground world houses bizarre alien creatures and valuable natural resources never before seen on Earth. To find the cure for Randolph Syndrome and get rich exploiting Asylum's resources, groups known as Sleepers delve into its dangerous depths. However, many mysteries and threats lurk within. Strange diseases, monsters, and conspiracies endanger the lives of Sleepers. Still, people are drawn there by greed, duty, and their own ambitions. One young Sleeper named Daniel Kai Shigure journeys into Asylum with a higher purpose. Gifted with a unique immunity to Randolph Syndrome, he joins the Antarctica Front organization to challenge Asylum's frontier. As humanity's best hope of awakening Randolph Syndrome's victims, Daniel drives to uncover secrets that may ultimately cure the global epidemic.",
