    "text": "As the One Year War nears its conclusion, the Earth Federation forces prepare to take the fight to the Principality of Zeon's home territory in space. The White Base crew, including ace pilot Amuro Ray, embark on this final campaign. Over the course of the war, Amuro has grown into a formidable pilot thanks to his emerging Newtype abilities. He soon encounters Lalah Sune, a mysterious woman who shares these talents. Meanwhile, Amuro's rival Char Aznable continues his own secret agenda amidst the chaos of war. Both Newtypes and mobile suits will be pushed to their limits as tragic events unfold. The fate of the Federation, Zeon, the Zabi family, and all who have fought in the war hangs in the balance. Though the end is near, the greatest battles are still to come. Old scores will be settled as friends become enemies and enemies align in the final days of the One Year War.",
