  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chappy is a young witch who grows weary of the antiquated customs of her magical homeland. Seeking new experiences, she ventures from the Land of Magic into the human world. Enchanted by what she discovers, Chappy decides to make a home amongst humanity. Soon after, missing their beloved daughter, Chappy's family follows her lead and leaves behind the magical realm to join Chappy's new life. As the first witch to employ a magical wand, Chappy uses her special chant \"Abura Mahariku Maharita Kabura\" to work wonders in her adopted world. With compassion and bravery, she averts disasters and rescues people in need. Her story evokes the tale of Mahou Tsukai Sally, another magical girl who bridged the human and mystic worlds. Indeed, Chappy's foray outside magical convention makes her a pioneerâ€”the fifth magical girl heroine in history.",
