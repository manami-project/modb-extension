    "text": "Soon after growing weary of the age-old traditions in her mystical homeland, a young enchantress named Chappy takes a bold step and ventures into the human realm. This adventurous witch, recognized as the first to wield a wand, quickly captivates her family with her newfound life, prompting them to join her in this unfamiliar world. As Chappy embraces her new home, she uses her magical prowess to save people and prevent catastrophes, all while reciting her unique incantation, 'Abura Mahariku Maharita Kabura.' As the fifth magical girl anime in history, Mahou Tsukai Chappy shares a similar spirit with the beloved Mahou Tsukai Sally (Little Witch Sally).",
