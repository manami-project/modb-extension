    "text": "Earth meets Hell in a daring tale of rebellion and revenge, as Lucifer, once a revered archangel, defies God and plummets into the abyss, becoming a fallen angel. Stripped of her celestial powers by the ruling Seven Deadly Sins of Hell, Lucifer encounters a mortal ally in Maria, an unassuming high school student, and Leviathan, the Demon King of Envy. With a shared goal to vanquish the Seven Deadly Sins, Lucifer embarks on a formidable quest for vengeance. As the former embodiment of pride, Lucifer must reclaim her strength and conquer the very sins she now represents, all while forging an unlikely alliance with a human and a demon. This provocative and enthralling journey weaves together themes of temptation, redemption, and the eternal struggle between good and evil. Prepare to be captivated by a world where the beautiful and seductive demon lords entice humans to indulge in their darkest desires.",
