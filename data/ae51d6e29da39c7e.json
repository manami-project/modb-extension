    "text": "The land of Britannia, once ravaged by the Demon Clan, now basks in the tranquility that followed their defeat 14 years ago. Born into this peaceful era is Tristan, the young prince of Liones, and the son of the legendary Meliodas and Elizabeth. Tristan carries within him a unique blend of powers, a legacy from both the Goddess and Demon Clans. Yet, his inability to harness these formidable forces often leads to unintended harm, causing him to shy away from using them.\n\nWhen a mysterious ailment befalls his mother, Elizabeth, Tristan is thrust into a journey that will test his mettle. He sets off towards Edinburgh Castle, once the stronghold of Deathpierce, a former Holy Knight, in search of answers. Along the way, he encounters an array of friends and foes, uncovering a sinister plot that threatens the harmony of Britannia.\n\nAs the son of the Dragon Sin of Wrath and a Goddess, Tristan must navigate this perilous path, learn to control his powers, and protect his loved ones. The fate of the Seven Deadly Sins and the future of Britannia hang in the balance. This original story by Nakaba Suzuki promises a thrilling adventure filled with courage, friendship, and the struggle to maintain peace.",
