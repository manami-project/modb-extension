    "text": "Toppa Bashin Dan, a fiery teenager renowned for his aggressive tactics in the Battle Spirits trading card game, finds his life taking an unexpected turn when a mysterious green-haired girl whisks him away to the fantastical realm of Grand Rolo. In this world, card duels serve as the ultimate arbiter of disputes. As soon as Dan arrives, he finds himself entangled in a bitter struggle between the kingdom's imperial army and its subjugated inhabitants.\n\nDubbed as a 'bearer of cores' light,' Dan is prophesied to be the savior of this land from its malevolent king. Joined by a young companion, Zungurii, and an eccentric witch named Magisa, Dan embarks on a journey across Grand Rolo, encountering fellow chosen warriors through card battles. As his reputation as the Clash King spreads, the kingdom's dark colonial past begins to unravel, hinting that Dan's crusade may have far-reaching consequences beyond his wildest dreams.\n\nThe second television anime series, Battle Spirits: Shounen Gekiha Dan, is set to premiere on September 13, produced by Sunrise anime studio in collaboration with Nagoya TV and Asatsu-DK (ADK) advertising agency. JAM Project will perform the opening theme, while Mitsuhiro Oikawa will sing the ending theme. The series will incorporate computer graphics to depict the thrilling card game battles.",
