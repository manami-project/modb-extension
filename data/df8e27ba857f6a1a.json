    "text": "Assigned to the shōjo manga department at Marukawa Shoten, Ritsu Onodera finds himself working under the stern and high-handed editor-in-chief, Masamune Takano. Having left his father's publishing company to avoid relying on family connections, Ritsu is determined to make it on his own, despite his lack of experience in shōjo manga. However, things get complicated when Ritsu discovers that Takano is none other than Saga, his first love from high school who he believed had played him for a fool. As they navigate their professional and personal relationships, Ritsu and Takano must confront their past and the feelings that still linger between them. Meanwhile, other editors in the department, including Yoshiyuki Katori, Hatori, Shouta Kisa, and their respective love interests, add to the complex web of emotions and relationships in this heartwarming and comedic story of first loves and second chances.",
