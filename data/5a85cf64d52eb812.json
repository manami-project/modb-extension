    "text": "Films presents a delightfully gory rom-com featuring the adorably clumsy Zonmi-chan, a zombie girl with a penchant for nibbling on her crush! Debuting at AnimeJapan 2016, this charming series follows the mishaps of our undead heroine as she navigates the trials and tribulations of love, all while leaving a trail of (mostly) harmless carnage in her wake. With future episodes slated for crowdfunding, join Zonmi-chan in her quest for romance and brains in this unique take on love among the living dead!",
