  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now here in the galaxy did Princess Valkyrie expect to find herself stranded on Earth, let alone in the humble abode of a high school boy, Kazuto, who also runs a public bathhouse. A fateful accident leads to Kazuto receiving a piece of Valkyrie's soul, tethering their lives together in an unexpected twist of fate. But the space princess's troubles don't end there, as the weakened state of her soul triggers a transformation, turning her into an 8-year-old child, both in body and mind. As Valkyrie's entourage, including her fierce sister Hydra and loyal catgirl maid Sanada, descends upon the bathhouse, Kazuto's once-peaceful life is turned upside down. Amidst the chaos, a certain bespectacled princess joins the fray, scouring the local high school for girls who can rock both brains and beauty. Brace yourself for a wild, interstellar ride filled with laughter, love, and a whole lot of soul-searching!",
