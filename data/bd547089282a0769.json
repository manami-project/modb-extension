  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sousukeâ€™s life as a detective in Gifu City takes a magical turn when he encounters Sara, a princess hailing from a far-off kingdom. Once a highly esteemed detective, Sousuke now barely scrapes by, taking on mundane cases that barely pique his interest. However, everything changes when Sara, the seventh princess of the fallen Orfim Kingdom, stumbles into his life. Fleeing from her rebellious countrymen, Sara seeks refuge on Earth through a portal, only to find herself in Sousuke's care.\n\nInitially skeptical of Sara's fantastical tale, Sousuke is left in awe when she demonstrates her magical abilities. With no other choice, he accepts her story and welcomes her into his life. As Sara adapts to modern-day Japan, she brings a touch of magic and positivity to Sousuke's otherwise dull existence.\n\nHowever, Sara's past is not far behind, and soon, Sousuke finds himself entangled in a world of magic and adventure. Alongside Livia, a knight from Sara's kingdom, Sousuke and the neighborhood's quirky characters learn to embrace the enchanting world that Sara brings to their doorstep. As Sara and Livia's optimism rubs off on them, Sousuke's life transforms into an extraordinary journey filled with wonder and excitement.",
