    "text": "Freshman Yuan Juntang enrolls at Minsong University with the goal of getting closer to his long-time crush, Zhu Zhu. However, his plans are disrupted when he meets Li Shiya, a former idol who recently returned to school after a hiatus. Though initially wary, Juntang soon forms a close friendship with Shiya. Meanwhile, Juntang attempts to reconnect with Zhu Zhu on campus. While she is aware of his feelings, Zhu Zhu maintains distance and avoids intimacy. As Juntang spends more time with Shiya, their relationship progresses beyond friendship. On his first day at Minsong, Juntang also meets his eccentric neighbor Lee Duna, a reclusive former celebrity hiding from her public past. After a rocky introduction, Juntang later discovers the truth behind Duna's self-imposed isolation and complicated history in the entertainment industry. As the school year unfolds, Juntang finds himself caught in an emotional vortex between the three women. He struggles to balance his lingering affection for Zhu Zhu, his deepening connection to Shiya, and his complex relationship with the unpredictable Duna.",
