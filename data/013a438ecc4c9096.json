  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akihito Kanbara finds himself on trial in a peculiar courtroom, facing an unexpected jury. Mirai Kuriyama, Mitsuki Nase, Sakura Inami, and Ai Shindou have transformed into chibi idol versions of themselves and take on the roles of prosecutors and judges, presenting evidence against Akihito. As the trial unfolds with lighthearted absurdity, it becomes clear there are charges being pressed not only against Akihito but other characters as well. One by one, the eccentric cast members of Kyoukai no Kanata stand accused of their quirky habits and must face the comedic revelations of truth. Presided over by Judge Ai Shindou, these trials cast the female leads as Chibi Angels on a mission to expose any wrongdoing, no matter how trivial. The first case targets Akihito, branded the \"ultimate Meganest.\" What exactly that charge refers to will be revealed over the course of this whimsical parallel world story. With offbeat humor and super-deformed visuals, this series promises to put a silly spin on the cast of Kyoukai no Kanata. As long as nonsense runs amok, the Chibi Angel judges will be there to lay down the law.",
