In this charming anime, a devoted mouse father embarks on a quest to find the perfect husband for his cherished daughter. Determined to find the strongest suitor, he approaches the sun, the cloud, and the wind, only to discover that none of them hold the ultimate power. The sun's rays can be blocked by a humble cloud, the cloud can be swept away by the wind, and the wind proves no match for a little girl's sturdy house. As the mouse father witnesses the house tremble, he realizes that the one who can shake even the most robust walls could be the ideal match for his daughter. Will this relentless pursuit lead him to the perfect suitor? Join the mouse father on his heartwarming journey and discover the answer for yourself.",
