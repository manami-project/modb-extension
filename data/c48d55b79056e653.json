Living under the watchful eyes of their caretaker, affectionately called Mom, the children enjoy an ideal life filled with good food, clean clothes, and the freedom to play within the confines of the orphanage. The only rules: take daily tests and never venture too far from the gate that separates them from the mysterious outside world.\n\nHowever, as the oldest siblings, Emma, Norman, and Ray start to question the true nature of their environment when they realize that every few months, one of their fellow orphans is adopted and never heard from again. Their curiosity leads them to discover the dark secrets that lie beyond the orphanage walls and the twisted reality of their beloved Mom.
