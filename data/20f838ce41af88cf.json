  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To the average person, high school biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi appears unremarkable. However, beneath his ordinary exterior lies an extraordinary fascination for the 'Ajin' or 'Demis' - half-human, half-monster beings that have recently been accepted into human society. In Shibasaki High School, Takahashi encounters three Demi students: the vibrant vampire Hikari Takanashi, the reserved dullahan Kyouko Machi, and the timid snow woman Yuki Kusakabe. Alongside fellow teacher Sakie Satou, a succubus with an aversion to men, Takahashi embarks on a journey to understand the daily lives, habits, and unique challenges of these extraordinary beings. As he conducts casual interviews and forms deeper bonds with his Demi students, Takahashi discovers that these creatures are not as peculiar as he once believed. Join Takahashi in this heartwarming and stimulating school comedy that explores the fascinating world of Demis.",
