  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shibasaki High School seems like a normal school, but some of its students have a secret - they are demi-humans, known as \"Ajin\" or \"Demis\", who possess supernatural powers and traits. Biology teacher Tetsuo Takahashi has long been fascinated by demi-humans and is thrilled to discover several are his students. Energetic vampire Hikari Takanashi loves tomato juice. Shy dullahan Kyouko Machi has difficulty socializing due to her detachable head. Yukionna Yuki Kusakabe avoids contact with others, fearful her ice powers could harm them. Math teacher Sakie Satou is a succubus who suppresses her seductive abilities around men. As Takahashi interacts with these demi-students and colleague, he strives to learn more about their abilities, psychology, and place in human society. Initially persecuted, demi-humans have recently become more accepted, though much remains mysterious about them. Takahashi hopes firsthand experience will provide insight. Along the way, Takahashi discovers demi-humans are not as unusual as he first thought. By strengthening personal bonds with his students, he helps them solve problems and navigate school life. This heartwarming story provides a fascinating glimpse into peaceful coexistence between human and demi-human.",
