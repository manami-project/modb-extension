    "text": "Takeo and Raiko find themselves in hot water, literally, when they're caught peeping on three magical girls, Puchihime, Ibuki, and Yuri, during their relaxing hot spring bath. While Takeo is promptly ejected by formidable bodyguards, Raiko's fate takes an unexpected turn as Puchihime enlists his help in washing her back. However, their impromptu bathhouse shenanigans are swiftly overshadowed by the looming threat of another 'Magical Girl' in the vicinity.\n\nIn a quaint seaside town, Raika, an ordinary schoolboy, cherishes his peaceful life alongside his childhood friend, Ibuki, and his loyal maid, Yuri. But his world is turned upside down when he discovers his father's secret identity as a magical girl (?). As if that wasn't enough, a bevy of magical girls descends upon his school, searching for the coveted Mana Prism, a powerful treasure stone.\n\nDespite his reluctance to don a feminine costume, Raika is coerced into joining the magical girl ranks. With his tranquil life now a distant memory, Raika must navigate the complexities of his newfound identity and protect his school from the impending magical girl onslaught. Brace yourself for a thrilling and comedic adventure as Raika embarks on an extraordinary journey to restore peace to his once-peaceful life!",
