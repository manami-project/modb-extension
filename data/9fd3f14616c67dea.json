    "text": "Shouko Komi is a beautiful and popular high school student who seems graceful and aloof to her classmates. However, she secretly suffers from extreme social anxiety and a communication disorder that prevents her from socializing. On the first day of school, her classmate Hitohito Tadano realizes that Komi cannot communicate properly when they are left alone in the classroom. After interacting through writing on the blackboard, Tadano learns of Komi's goal to make 100 friends in high school. He decides to become her first friend and help her achieve this dream. As the two spend more time together, an unlikely friendship forms between the awkward Komi and the average Tadano. Along with a cast of eccentric classmates, they share humorous adventures and work to help Komi overcome her anxiety one step at a time on her quest to make 100 friends.",
