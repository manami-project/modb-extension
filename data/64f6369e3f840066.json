    "text": "Jarinko Chie is a comedic anime film directed by Takahata Isao in 1981, based on a popular manga series by Etsumi Haruki. It tells the story of 10-year-old Chie, dubbed \"the most unfortunate girl in Japan.\" She lives in Osaka with her father Tetsu, an unemployed former yakuza member, after her parents' separation. Chie manages the family's small diner single-handedly as her father spends his time drinking, gambling, and engaging in questionable activities. Though facing hardships, including getting mocked by classmates, Chie tackles each day with a smile. She often has to reign in her father's irresponsible behavior at the restaurant. Despite its heavy premise, Jarinko Chie delivers plenty of laughs by highlighting the eccentricities of its characters and Osakan culture. The film was very successful, spawning a television series also directed by Takahata. At its core, it is a heartwarming tale of perseverance and family.",
