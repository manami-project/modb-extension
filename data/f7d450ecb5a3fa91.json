  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows the Phantom Thieves, a group of vigilantes who steal corrupt people's hearts to reform them. The anime begins with the Thieves getting back together to infiltrate the Palace of a mysterious enemy and stop their schemes. However, they must do this covertly to avoid detection from Gorou Akechi, a former teammate turned traitor. Initially, it appears the leader of the Thieves, Ren Amamiya, has died by suicide. This leaves the remaining members distraught and lacking purpose. But prosecutor Sae Niijima soon informs them that Ren is actually alive. Galvanized by this revelation, the Phantom Thieves embark on one last audacious heist to prove they stand for justice and bring down Akechi. The official Twitter account for the anime also announced there will be a special broadcast titled \"Dark Sun...\" airing before the end of 2018, likely continuing the Phantom Thieves' story. As the metaverse warriors pull off their spectacular finale, viewers are left on the edge of their seats wondering if they will succeed or if their enemy and Akechi will outwit them in the end.",
