  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fritz Freleng-inspired action and a touch of tragedy come together in this unique Sanrio production, which blends the aesthetics of an anime art film with the energy of a Warner Bros. cartoon. With a soulful 70s jazz soundtrack and minimal dialogue, the film follows the story of Joe, a solitary dog who finds companionship in an unexpected form: a beautiful rose. When a malevolent crow threatens his beloved flower, Joe must summon the courage to defend her in this visually imaginative and emotionally poignant tale.",
