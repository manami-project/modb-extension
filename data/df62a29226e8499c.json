    "text": "It begins with the Chaos Pearl, a celestial entity that was contained and split into two components: the Spirit Pearl and the Demon Orb. The Primeval Lord of Heaven dispatches the Spirit Pearl to Earth, destining it to reincarnate as Nezha, the third son of Li Jing. However, a conspiracy by the Dragon King leads to the Demon Orb being reincarnated as Nezha instead.\n\nBorn with a demonic nature, Nezha is feared and shunned by those around him. The prophecy declares that he will bring destruction to the world, causing him to grapple with the choice between embracing his dark destiny or striving for heroism.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dragon King, dissatisfied with his species' role as jailers of the Heavenly Court, hopes that the Spirit Pearl, now in his possession, will reincarnate his son, Ao Bing, and elevate the dragons' standing in the eyes of Heaven.\n\nAs Nezha battles his chaotic tendencies, he must decide whether to succumb to his evil fate or defy it, proving himself worthy of the heroic future his parents envisioned for him. The young boy's journey unfolds as he navigates the complexities of his destiny, teetering between good and evil in this captivating anime.",
