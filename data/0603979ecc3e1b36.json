    "text": "Carbink reside in the tranquil, subterranean Diamond Domain, ruled by the Mythical Pokémon Diancie. The life force of this realm, the Sacred Diamond, is disintegrating, and Diancie lacks the strength to generate a new one. In her quest for the Legendary Pokémon Xerneas and its divine power, Diancie crosses paths with Ash, Pikachu, and their friends. Their journey, however, is fraught with danger as they encounter a band of thieves coveting Diancie's diamond-creating abilities and inadvertently awaken the destructive Legendary Pokémon Yveltal. To save the Diamond Domain from impending doom, Ash and his friends must help Diancie unlock her true potential and quell Yveltal's devastating rampage.",
