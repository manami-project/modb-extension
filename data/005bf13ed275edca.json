  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tatami-chan is a sardonic ghost from the countryside who has recently moved to Tokyo. There, she rubs shoulders with a vibrant community of spirits, yokai, and humans while trying to make ends meet. Though unemployed, Tatami-chan still has to pay for utilities and even look for work. Beyond these mundane struggles, she uses her candid wit to expose the duplicity underpinning modern urban life. With her bold honesty, Tatami-chan confronts the strange characters around her, including her peculiar landlady and a monk of questionable morals. Though small in stature as a zashiki warashi, a childlike house spirit, Tatami-chan stands tall, facing down humans and ghosts alike with sharp-tongued audacity. Comedic chaos ensues in this pleasant horror gag comedy centered around the antics of a rural ghost making her way through the wilds of Tokyo.",
