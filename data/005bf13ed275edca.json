  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the quirky and humorous journey of Tatami-chan, a charming yet sarcastic ghost hailing from Iwate Prefecture, who finds herself navigating the bustling streets of Tokyo. As a Zashiki Warashi, she encounters a motley crew of spirits, supernatural beings, and eccentric humans, all while grappling with the challenges of job hunting and managing her utility bills. With her unyielding honesty and sharp wit, Tatami-chan fearlessly confronts the peculiarities of urban life and the supernatural realm, offering a delightful blend of comedy, horror, and a touch of social commentary in this modern-day ghost story.",
