  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Once part of the 'Jump Super Anime Tour' in October 1994, this anime precedes the Ninku TV series, introducing the final four Ninku ninjas - Fuusuke, Touji, and Aichou. Their journey leads them to Sky Plains Village, with a mission to present a commemorative knife to Makoto, the sister of their departed comrade Eiji. Upon arrival, the village appears deserted, with terrified residents hiding from the Rasenryu pirates, who have seized control, causing chaos, plundering, and kidnapping locals. In a restaurant, the Ninku encounter Makoto, disguised as a boy, and her companion Sakichi, who reveal the village's plight. Determined to restore peace, the Ninku ninjas prepare to confront the Rasenryu. However, they soon discover that they are not the only ones claiming the title of 'Ninku' in this beleaguered town. As they strive to protect the citizens and honor their fallen friend, Fuusuke, Aichou, and Touji must also assert their true identities as Ninku ninjas.",
