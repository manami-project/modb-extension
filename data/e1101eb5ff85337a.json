  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rei Ayanami, Shinji Ikari, and the enigmatic organization NERV stand as humanity's last defense against the otherworldly beings known as Angels in \"Evangelion: 1.11 - You Are (Not) Alone.\" Set in the post-apocalyptic Tokyo-3, 15 years after the devastating Second Impact, the story follows Shinji as he reluctantly takes on the responsibility of piloting the colossal biomechanical Evangelion Unit-01.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of his distant father and NERV's commander, Gendo Ikari, Shinji must confront his deep-seated insecurities and fears to protect mankind from the relentless Angel attacks. Alongside fellow pilot Rei and his guardian, Misato Katsuragi, Shinji embarks on a perilous journey of self-discovery and redemption, as he questions the very worth of the humanity he is fighting to save.\n\nThis film serves as a standalone remake of the original \"Neon Genesis Evangelion\" series, reimagining the first six episodes with revised scenes and a 101-minute runtime. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Shinji's inner turmoil and the action-packed battles against the Angels promise a gripping and thought-provoking experience.",
