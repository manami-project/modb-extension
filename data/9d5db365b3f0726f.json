  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is September 1944, the height of World War II in Europe. The Nazis have undertaken a secret program attempting to utilize vampire biology to genetically engineer an army of undead super soldiers. Fearing such forces could turn the tide of the war, Sir Arthur Hellsing, current leader of the Hellsing Organization, dispatches his two top agents into German-occupied Poland to infiltrate and destroy the program. Walter C. Dornez, Hellsing's deadly human operative known as \"The Angel of Death,\" partners with Alucard, an ancient and powerful vampire indentured to the Hellsing family. This unlikely duo attempts to end the Nazi experimentation before their research can produce an abomination that threatens all of Europe. However, they soon discover that even interrupting the Nazi project mid-way may have unleashed a monstrous threat beyond their worst expectations.",
