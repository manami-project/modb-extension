  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Out numbered and outgunned, the Allies face an unprecedented threat during World War II as Nazi Germany delves into the dark realm of artificial vampire technology. In a bid to tip the scales in their favor, the Nazis are conducting monstrous experiments, hoping to create an army of super-soldiers. Though the technology remains in its infancy, the intermediate stages pose a significant danger to the anti-German coalition.\n\nIn response, Sir Arthur Hellsing, the head of the Hellsing House, deploys his most formidable agents—the seasoned butler and soldier Walter C. Dornez, and the enigmatic vampire Alucard—into the heart of enemy territory, German-occupied Poland. Their mission: to thwart the Nazi project and safeguard England and its allies from the looming supernatural menace.\n\nAs Walter and Alucard plunge deeper into the conflict, they must confront the horrors of war and the monstrous creations spawned by the Nazis' twisted ambitions. Their actions will not only shape the outcome of the war but also leave indelible scars on their souls.\n\nThis gripping tale can be found in Hellsing: The Dawn Specials, bundled with Hellsing Ultimate Limited Edition volumes starting from volume 8.",
