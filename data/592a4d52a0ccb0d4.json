    "text": "The Millionaire Detective: Balance Unlimited follows the unlikely partnership between two very different detectives in the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department's Modern Crime Prevention Task Force. Daisuke Kanbe is the extraordinarily wealthy heir to one of Japan's richest families who spares no expense at solving crimes, even evaluating human lives by their monetary value. In contrast, his new partner Haru Katou firmly believes money should not factor into police work and is appalled by Daisuke's materialism. Despite their clashing personalities and worldviews, Daisuke and Haru must find a way to work together as they take on challenging cases of crime and mystery in the city. Though initially at odds, the compassionate Haru hopes to temper Daisuke's detached methods while Daisuke pushes Haru outside his comfort zone. As this mismatched detective duo pursues justice, they just may find they have more to learn from each other than they realized. Will they be able to look past their differences to take down criminals and solve the toughest cases coming their way?",
