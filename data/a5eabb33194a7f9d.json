    "text": "Nagisa Shiota and his fellow misfits of Class 3-E at Kunugigaoka Middle School are tasked with a seemingly impossible mission: assassinate their new teacher before the Earth faces destruction. The eccentric, octopus-like teacher, known as Koro-sensei, has already demonstrated his unparalleled power by reducing the moon to a permanent crescent shape. With the promise of a 10 billion yen reward and the fate of the world hanging in the balance, the students must find a way to kill their indestructible teacher who also happens to be the best educator they've ever encountered. As they hone their academic and assassination skills, the students of Class 3-E will face challenges from both their oppressive school system and their own personal lives while attempting to uncover the secret to defeating Koro-sensei in this action-packed, humor-filled adventure.",
