  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Love and justice are the driving forces for Hibino Hareluya, a rebellious teenager with a divine lineage. As the son of God, Hareluya's unruly behavior and penchant for throwing punches displeases his heavenly father. In an attempt to teach his son responsibility, God banishes Hareluya to Earth, stripping him of his powers and enrolling him as a student at Rakuen High School.\n\nUnder the watchful eye of his father, who poses as a local priest, Hareluya embarks on a series of adventures to right wrongs and help others accomplish their dreams. Along the way, he forms an unlikely friendship with Kyoshiro Okamoto, a college freshman with aspirations to study art in France. Together, they navigate the challenges of high school life, with Hareluya's fists of justice always at the ready.\n\nDespite his newfound mortality, Hareluya's ego remains intact, and he sets his sights on world domination. With the support of his friends, including aspiring painter Kiyoshiro, talisman seller Michiru Yamane, and rock star hopeful Makoto Ichijou, Hareluya takes on any challenge that comes his way, even if it means defying God himself. Will Hareluya learn the importance of responsibility and make his father proud, or will his rebellious nature continue to cause chaos on Earth? Only time will tell in this action-packed, divine comedy.",
