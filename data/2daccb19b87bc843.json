    "text": "Why are zombies ignoring one man in a world overrun by the undead? This is the intriguing premise of our story, which follows the life of Yuusuke Takemura, an antisocial office worker who suddenly finds himself unemployed and demotivated after his company goes bankrupt. After being attacked by a mysterious man and falling ill for several days, Yuusuke wakes up to discover that the world has been taken over by zombies.\n\nHowever, in this new reality, Yuusuke is an anomaly. He is the only person who is not attacked by the flesh-eating monsters. With this strange new power, Yuusuke decides to live life on his own terms, unconcerned with helping others or being a hero. As he navigates the post-apocalyptic landscape, he must determine how to use his unique situation to his advantage and uncover the truth behind his immunity to the zombies.\n\nIn this thrilling and suspenseful anime, we follow Yuusuke's journey as he tries to survive in a world where civilization has crumbled and the line between hero and villain is blurred. Will he rise to the occasion and become a beacon of hope for humanity, or will he succumb to his selfish desires and become just another survivor in a world overrun by the undead? Only time will tell.",
