    "text": "And so begins the enchanting tale of Aruto Kirihara, an ordinary high school student with an extraordinary love for the Alice stories. In his pursuit to create his own version of the elusive 'third book', he encounters a girl who seems to have leapt straight from the pages of his imagination - Arisugawa Arisu, a real-life Alice. Arisu, along with other girls known as 'Alice', possess fragments of the unpublished Alice book in their minds, and engage in battles to collect these pieces. The ultimate prize? A single wish granted to the one who completes the book.\n\nAruto, although not an 'Alice' himself, finds himself entangled in this whimsical world of battling Alices, each with their own unique powers and stories. Together with his younger sister Kiraha, they embark on a journey to uncover the secrets of the Alice books, the enigmatic author, and the magical land of Alice. As Aruto navigates this extra-dimensional Wonderland, he strives to help Arisu complete the legendary 'Eternal Alice' without taking the stories of other Alices. Will they succeed in their quest, and what will be the cost of their wish? Join Aruto and Arisu in their thrilling adventure to find out!",
