However, their peace is shattered when a tumultuous storm strikes, devastating their home and drying up the river that sustained them with fish. With the village weakened and facing starvation, Kawatarou embarks on a critical mission into the mountains alongside his girlfriend. There, the pair hopes to discover a bounty that can restore vitality to their people.
