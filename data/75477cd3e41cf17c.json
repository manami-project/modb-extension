    "text": "Neighbors, entities from another dimension with mysterious powers, have prompted the establishment of the Border Defense Agency to counter their invasions. The second season of \"World Trigger\" picks up where the first left off, with the agents of Border thwarting the second invasion by the Neighbor nation Aftokrator. As Border prepares an expedition to the Neighbor dimension to rescue abducted agents, Osamu Mikumo, Yuuma Kuga, and Chika Amatori engage in Border's ranking fights to improve their team's standing and secure a spot on the mission. Meanwhile, a new threat looms as Yuuichi Jin's Side Effect predicts another Neighbor attack. To prevent panic and protect the expedition ship, Border assembles an elite team led by Kei Tachikawa to intercept the attack. With the city still recovering from the previous invasion and resources stretched thin due to the ongoing rank wars, the success of the expedition hangs in the balance.  The Mikumo Squad, consisting of Osamu Mikumo, Yuuma Kuga, and Chika Amatori, must rise through the ranks to join the expedition and confront the challenges that await them in the Neighbor dimension.",
