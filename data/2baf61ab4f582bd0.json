  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cold Cosmo, an alien group with a chilling mission, threatens to plunge the universe into darkness, transforming warm and luminous stars and planets into cold, desolate wastelands. In a desperate bid to save the future, a creature known as a Gasshapon, resembling Bandai's Gashapon prize-dispensing machines, is sent back in time by none other than the future version of an ordinary high school student named Shouta.\n\nThe Gasshapon's objective is to transport young Shouta to the year 2080, but due to the imperfect nature of time travel, Shouta finds himself thrust into an entirely different era: the time of the Honnouji Incident, circa 1582. In this new timeline, Shouta is not just an ordinary high school student; he becomes Oda Nobunaga, a powerful and renowned warlord.\n\nWhile the ONA series project was canceled, the remaining one-minute promotional video offers a tantalizing glimpse into this extraordinary tale of time travel, transformation, and the struggle to save the universe from the icy clutches of Cold Cosmo.",
