  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Their summer vacation takes an unexpected turn when a group of fifteen high school marine club members find themselves mysteriously transported to a world where dinosaurs and humans coexist. Based loosely on Jules Verne's 1888 novel, Two Years' Vacation, the students must navigate this dangerous new world filled with talking dinosaurs, revolutionaries, pirates, a princess, and primitive scientists.\n\nAs they attempt to return home, they form unlikely alliances to escape from oppressive soldiers, bandits, vicious dinosaurs, and fanatical priests. However, internal conflict arises as the two oldest boys clash, leading to a split within the group and a deceitful double-cross plot. Amidst the tension, unexpected romances blossom, and the students learn that each possesses unique strengths that can help them get home â€“ if they can work together.\n\nStranded in a world where danger lurks around every corner, these high school students must rely on themselves and their newfound allies to survive and find their way back home. Will they be able to put aside their differences and work together, or will they succumb to the perils of this strange new world?",
