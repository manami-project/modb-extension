    "text": "After the Second Neo Zeon War, an uneasy peace blankets the Universal Century's 105th year. The Earth Federation, despite its iron grip on Earth and its space colonies, is plagued by corruption and intermittent military conflicts. In response to the Federation's inhumane 'Man Hunting' policy and accelerated pollution of Earth, an anti-Federation group called Mafty rises. Led by the enigmatic 'Mafty Navue Erin,' Mafty carries out acts of terrorism against high-ranking Federation officials, gaining support from the disillusioned public.\n\nUnbeknownst to many, 'Mafty Navue Erin' is Hathaway Noa, son of the esteemed Federation commander Bright Noa. Haunted by his past in Char's Rebellion, Hathaway embodies the spirit of both the loyal soldier Amuro Ray and the rebellious Char Aznable. His life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters Federation officer Kenneth Sleg and a mysterious young woman, Gigi Andalucia, who discovers his secret identity. As the conflict between Mafty and the Federation intensifies, Hathaway's double life puts his newfound friendships in jeopardy. With a powerful Gundam prototype at his disposal, Hathaway must navigate his path towards a future shaped by resistance and armed conflict.",
