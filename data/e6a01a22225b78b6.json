    "text": "Coin the desert wanderer, Sam, navigates the sun-scorched Earth of the distant future, where the once bountiful oceans have given way to an endless expanse of sand. The unforgiving environment has left humanity struggling to survive, with the government maintaining control through an army of cloned soldiers known as 'Ideal Children'.\n\nAmidst this desolation, Sam's life takes an unexpected turn when he encounters a beautiful stranger, Maya, fleeing from the relentless grasp of the cloned enforcers. Unbeknownst to him, Maya's presence holds a hidden connection to his long-lost brother, who vanished while pursuing the elusive sand whale, Ozma.\n\nNow, with Maya under his protection, Sam finds himself entangled in a dangerous web of intrigue and adventure. As they journey through the unforgiving desert, they must confront the very monster that swallowed Sam's brother's dreams, the mighty Ozma.\n\nIn a world where hope is as scarce as water, Sam and Maya's journey unfolds against the backdrop of a ruthless pursuit, mysterious royal connections, and the ever-looming threat of the colossal sand whale. Their story weaves a tale of survival, courage, and the unyielding human spirit in the face of adversity.",
