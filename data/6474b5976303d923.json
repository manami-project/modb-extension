    "text": "Nihon TV (NTV) adopted an enigmatic green pig-like creature with large eyes as their mascot in 1992, despite its creators at Ghibli being uncertain about the creature's true nature. This mysterious being, featured in a series of short TV clips called \"Nan darou,\" engaged in peculiar activities, such as consuming text, in segments lasting between 5 and 15 seconds. The title \"Nan darou\" itself reflects the creators' uncertainty about the creature's identity, making it an intriguing and whimsical addition to NTV's programming.\n\nThis collection of short TV spots invites viewers to join the creators in pondering the true essence of this curious green creature, making for an entertaining and thought-provoking watch.",
