    "text": "In the world of the popular otome RPG, Light Magic and the Hero, Eumiella Dolkness finds herself reincarnated as the notorious villainess with dark hair and rare dark-type magic, both of which are associated with the Demon Lord. With her memories of her past life in modern Japan intact, she becomes aware of her impending fate as the hidden boss in the game. Determined to break free from her predetermined role and achieve a peaceful life, Eumiella embarks on a journey to level up and hone her magical skills in secret. However, her dreams of anonymity are shattered when her powers are publicly revealed to be at level 99, an unheard-of feat even for the royal knights. As the royal family seeks her assistance and the school demands proof of her strength, Eumiella must navigate the challenges that come with her newfound power and work to prevent her descent into becoming the Demon Lord. Will she succeed in her quest for tranquility, or will she be consumed by the very fate she sought to escape?",
