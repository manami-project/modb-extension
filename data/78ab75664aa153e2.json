  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takeru Shirogane, a high school student, finds himself in a groundhog day scenario, waking up to the same day three years after the events of Muv-Luv Unlimited. Initially dismissing his experiences as a dream, he soon realizes that he has been transported back in time to the beginning of the Unlimited events. In this alternate reality, Earth has been embroiled in a relentless war against the BETA, an alien race that invaded in 1973. Determined to prevent the implementation of the Alternative V project—a desperate plan to send a portion of humanity into space while leaving the rest to perish—Takeru partners with Professor Yuuko Kouzuki to complete the Alternative IV project, humanity's last hope. To succeed, Takeru must become a skilled mecha pilot, mastering the colossal Tactical Surface Fighters alongside his comrades. With only two months to prepare and the fate of mankind hanging in the balance, Takeru embarks on a mission to alter this grim future and save humanity from the brink of extinction.",
