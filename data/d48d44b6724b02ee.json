    "text": "One albino woman named Misaki Saiki has been seeing ghosts since childhood. Now, she serves as a spiritual medium for the city's secret division, solving supernatural cases and helping spirits find peace. To make ends meet, she also works as a dominatrix at an S&M club, where she has gained a reputation for her ability to handle men's darkest desires. With the help of her martial arts-loving partner and an apprentice, Misaki navigates through a life filled with lost spirits, overzealous fans, and the constant struggle to find a sense of normalcy. Despite her unique talents and the challenges they bring, Misaki remains determined to help both the living and the dead find the solace they seek.",
