  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Misaki is a 19-year old medium who has been able to see ghosts since childhood. She works as a special consultant for a secret government division that deals with supernatural cases involving spirits that need help passing on. To make ends meet, she also works as a dominatrix at an S&M club, where her extraordinary talents taming men's twisted desires have gained her a cult following. Though her unique abilities forbid her from living an ordinary life, Misaki selflessly dedicates herself to helping restless spirits find peace while also fulfilling the unconventional desires of her clients. With her fearless spirit partner who loves martial arts, a ghost-fearing apprentice, and a persistent stalker always trailing her, Misaki confronts mysteries and possessions, exorcises curses, and solves supernatural puzzles - all while sporting her signature albino appearance. Balancing her calling as a medium with her work as a dominatrix, Misaki must draw on her compassion and inner strength to overcome loneliness and hardship. Her story is one of a strong, capable woman empowering spirits and people alike to embrace their true selves on their own unique journeys.",
