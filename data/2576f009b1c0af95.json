    "text": "Due to an embarrassing habit of yawning when feeling shy, Koron Nemuta stumbles upon a peculiar, face-shaped jar while lost. This jar serves as a gateway to a magical desert world inhabited by a genie named Akubi. Upon Koron's first yawn, Akubi emerges from the jar, ready to serve her new master by granting a wish. However, a second yawn sends Akubi back into her confinement.\n\nAs fate would have it, Koron's yawn releases Akubi from the jar, sparking an unlikely friendship between the two. Despite Akubi's well-intentioned efforts to fulfill Koron's wishes, her attempts often lead to comedic mishaps. Nevertheless, the pair embarks on a series of enchanting adventures, with their bond growing stronger amidst the magical ups and downs.",
