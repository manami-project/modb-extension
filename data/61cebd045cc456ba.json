  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Until now, the Sakurada siblings have lived a seemingly ordinary life, but being part of the royal family is far from mundane. Each sibling possesses an extraordinary ability, and for Akane, the third-oldest daughter, manipulating gravity comes as naturally as breathing. However, their father, the wise king, has a unique plan for choosing his successor: an election where the nine siblings must win the hearts of the people to claim the throne.\n\nTo ensure their safety and let the citizens get to know them, the siblings' daily lives are constantly monitored by thousands of cameras, turning their existence into a nationwide reality show. For the introverted Akane, this constant scrutiny is a living nightmare. Despite her discomfort, she decides to run for the throne, driven by the desire to rid herself of the ever-present cameras.\n\nCan Akane, with her crippling shyness and lack of popularity, outshine her more charismatic siblings and convince the public that she is the best choice to lead the kingdom? Join her on this journey of self-discovery and political intrigue in Joukamachi no Dandelion.",
