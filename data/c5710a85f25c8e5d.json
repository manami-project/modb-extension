  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Buddhist priest Genjo Sanzo, a far cry from the conventional monk, is summoned to restore harmony in a once peaceful land where humans and demons coexisted. The tranquility is disrupted when an ancient demon, Gyumao, is on the brink of resurrection through a forbidden blend of science and sorcery. Sanzo embarks on a perilous journey westward to prevent Gyumao's revival and save the world from impending doom.\n\nAccompanied by a motley crew of demons with human traits—the jovial and ever-hungry Son Goku, the charming and polite Cho Hakkai, and the half-demon, half-human chain-smoker Sha Gojyo—Sanzo navigates through treacherous terrains filled with evil sorcerers and monstrous creatures. Despite their differences and Sanzo's initial reluctance to accept his companions, they form an unbreakable bond as they face countless challenges together.\n\nIn this action-packed and humorous adventure, the unlikely heroes must overcome their personal quirks and work together to defeat the looming darkness and restore balance between humans and demons in their world. Will they succeed in their mission and prevent Gyumao's resurrection, or will the world succumb to chaos and destruction? Join Sanzo and his crew on their thrilling journey to find out.",
