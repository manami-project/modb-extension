    "text": "Town of Michina was once a barren land, until the mythical Pokémon Arceus, creator of everything, took pity and bestowed upon a man named Damos the Jewel of Life, crafted from five of its Life Plates. However, when the time came to return the Jewel, Damos betrayed Arceus, leading the deity to retreat into a deep slumber, vowing vengeance upon humanity. In the present day, Ash and his friends arrive in the now prosperous Michina Town, only to witness the awakening of Arceus, bent on reclaiming its power and exacting its revenge. As the legendary Pokémon Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina struggle to contain Arceus' wrath, Ash and his friends must travel back in time to right the ancient wrong and prevent the destruction of all dimensions. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, can Ash and his friends restore the Jewel of Life to Arceus and quell its righteous anger before it's too late?",
