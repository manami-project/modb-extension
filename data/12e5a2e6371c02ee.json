    "text": "The lighthearted sorceress Lina Inverse and her rival Naga the Serpent travel to the once-peaceful Mipross Island seeking its legendary healing hot springs, only to find the island now overrun by bandits and dark forces. They soon learn that years ago, an evil mazoku named Joyrock slaughtered the island's elven inhabitants and absorbed their power. When joined by the vengeful mage Rowdy Gabriev, whose elven love was among Joyrockâ€™s victims, Lina and Naga take on the task of defeating Joyrock and freeing the island from his influence. Though originally seeking rest and relaxation, the chaotic duo rises to meet this new threat with their customary panache. Their journey pits them against strange creatures, dark conspiracies and tests the limits of their magical abilities as they unravel the tragic history of Mipross Island in this exciting prequel story.",
