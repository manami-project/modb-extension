  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They say a vast ocean of sand stretches beyond the horizon, and nestled within it is the Mud Whale, a floating island that serves as a sanctuary for its inhabitants. Most of the people living in this utopian vessel possess a unique power known as 'Saimia,' a gift that comes with the heavy price of a shortened lifespan.\n\nChakuro, a curious 14-year-old archivist, has never encountered anyone from outside the Mud Whale. He spends his days documenting the remnants of forgotten civilizations discovered on abandoned islands. One fateful day, Chakuro and his friends stumble upon an island that mirrors their own. Among the ruins, they find a mysterious girl named Lykos who holds the power to alter the course of their lives forever.\n\nAs the Mud Whale faces the wrath of masked soldiers seeking vengeance for a long-forgotten transgression, Chakuro and his people must confront the harsh realities of their world. With Lykos' arrival, the floodgates of change are flung open, and the possibility of escaping the endless sea of sand becomes a glimmer of hope for the Mud Whale's inhabitants.",
