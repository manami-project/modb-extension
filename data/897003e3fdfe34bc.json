  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Princess Melody, trapped in the clutches of a ruthless demon lord, dreams of a picture-perfect social media post amidst her bleak captivity. Meanwhile, in the real world, Light and Yomi, two middle school friends and avid gamers, find themselves transported to a fantastical RPG-like realm. Tasked with rescuing the princess, the duo embarks on an adventure they never anticipated.\n\nWhile Light embraces their newfound heroic destiny with enthusiasm, Yomi finds the prospect of being a hero more bothersome than thrilling. Joined by Alpha, an AI robot with a level-up program, they form an unlikely party to commence their quest. Yet, as they navigate through their new reality, the duo can't help but indulge in their usual banter, often digressing to random topics and making little progress.\n\nAs the trio struggles to find their footing in this unfamiliar world, one question remains: Will they manage to unite and overcome their challenges, level up, and ultimately defeat the demon lord, or will they remain stuck in their old gaming habits? Only time will tell if Light, Yomi, and Alpha can rise to the occasion and save Princess Melody.",
