    "text": "He was just an ordinary otaku, but when Iwatani Naofumi stumbles upon a mysterious book, he's transported to a fantastical world where he's tasked with becoming one of the Four Cardinal Heroesâ€”the Shield Hero. Naofumi eagerly embarks on his adventure, only to be betrayed and left penniless and dishonored. With no one left to trust, he enlists the help of a slave named Raphtalia and sets out to face the Waves of Catastrophe. But as the countdown to the next Wave abruptly halts and strange occurrences begin to plague the land, Naofumi and his party find themselves facing a new threat: the Spirit Tortoise, a formidable creature that has awakened from its slumber to wreak havoc once again. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Naofumi must put aside his mistrust and join forces with the other heroes to defeat this powerful enemy. But with the Spirit Tortoise's resurrection no mere accident, Naofumi and his allies must also uncover the truth behind its revival and bring the mastermind to justice. Will Naofumi be able to overcome the challenges that lie ahead and restore peace to the land? The Shield Hero rises once again to protect what he holds dear.",
