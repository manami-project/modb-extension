  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One thousand hand-copied sutras later, the noblewoman Iratsume embarks on a spiritual journey in the heart of Nara-period Japan, where Buddhism has just been introduced from China. Drawn to a forbidden temple at the foot of a distant mountain, she encounters the ghost of Prince Otsu, who was executed long ago in a political conspiracy. Mistaking Iratsume for her ancestor, the beautiful Mimimo No Toji, the prince's restless spirit becomes captivated by her, as her face was his last vision before his untimely death.\n\nAs Iratsume's purity leads her to see the prince as a divine being, the two engage in a struggle of desires. While the prince yearns for the material world and the beauty of Mimimo No Toji, Iratsume remains steadfast in her devotion to Buddhism. As a storm rages, her maid and ladies-in-waiting perform a protective ritual, giving Iratsume the strength to weave a magnificent shroud adorned with Buddhist imagery. This shroud, a Mandala, promises salvation for both Iratsume and the prince, leading to an unconventional and captivating climax.",
