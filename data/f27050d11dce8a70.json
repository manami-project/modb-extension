  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuta Asamura's parents went through a difficult divorce when he was young, leaving him wary of relationships. However, his life is upended when his father remarries, and Yuuta suddenly acquires a new stepmother and stepsister - Saki Ayase, the most popular girl at school. Carrying scars from their parents' failed marriages, Yuuta and Saki agree to maintain a respectful distance as step siblings. But living under one roof makes that difficult, and they slowly begin to connect through shared experiences. Though initially cautious, a deeper bond quietly grows between them over time. As they learn to rely on each other, Yuuta starts seeing Saki's kind and responsible nature beneath her beauty and popularity. And for Saki, Yuuta's sincerity and consideration touch her after years of isolation and independence. Their newfound closeness leads them to confront the true depth of their feelings for one another. What began as a tentative friendship may blossom into something more.",
