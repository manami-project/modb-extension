  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows four high school girls who are members of the tennis club at Kameido High. Despite being in the tennis club, the girls seem to spend little time actually playing tennis. Instead, their days are filled with hilarious antics and chaotic routines. Over the course of the series, the girls occasionally participate in some tennis matches, but the focus remains on their offbeat daily adventures. These have included helping out at a local daycare and defending their tennis court from encroachment by the school's baseball team - by challenging them to a baseball match! Through all the nonsense, the bonds of friendship between the four unique members of this unorthodox tennis club continue to grow. Their quirky personalities and carefree approach to school life promise many more humorous moments to come.",
