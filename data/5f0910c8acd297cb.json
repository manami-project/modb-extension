    "text": "Magician's Academy is set in an alternate reality protected by a magical portal. Within this realm lies the exclusive Magician's Academy which trains students in the magical arts and summoning. Takuto Hasegawa is one such student who attends the academy while also living an ordinary life on Earth. However, his life is thrown into chaos when he accidentally summons a naked girl named Tanarotte during an exam. Despite her immense magical power, Tanarotte pledges undying loyalty to Takuto as her creator. Representatives of the god and demon realms aim to eliminate Tanarotte before she chooses allegiance to either side and disrupts the balance of power. As Tanarotte's master, Takuto finds himself embroiled in humorous and compromising situations involving scantily-clad women who he must now watch over. While struggling to continue his magical studies, Takuto gradually and unintentionally gathers more women under his care.",
