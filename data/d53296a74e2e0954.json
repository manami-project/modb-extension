  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dragon-related deaths have historically accounted for 72% of all fatalities in London, yet these mythical creatures remain invisible to the majority of the population. A secret defense force exists in the hidden 'reverse' side of London, known as Reverse London, where inhabitants can see these dragons. Only a select few of these residents become witches or wizards, qualified to make direct contact with the dragons. The story revolves around two such witches, Noel Niihashi and Ninny Spangcole, who work as protection agents for Wing Bind, an organization dedicated to dragon conservation and management. Their mission is to safeguard the people of London by managing these dragons. As they navigate their responsibilities, an unexpected twist involving a young man with a mysterious connection to dragons disrupts the peace they have worked hard to maintain.",
