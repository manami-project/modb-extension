  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyoto's Mitsuhoshi Bank once boasted a young badminton prodigy, Mikoto Shiratori, but after a devastating loss during his high school years, Mikoto's performance failed to meet expectations, leading to his dismissal from the bank. However, an unexpected opportunity arises when Mikoto is offered a position at Sunlight Beverage, where he can continue his badminton career while working in the sales department. Despite his initial reluctance, Mikoto accepts the offer, only to find himself thrust back into the world of doubles badminton - a realm he had sworn to abandon after a traumatic incident with a former partner.\n\nNow paired with Tatsuru Miyazumi, a successful and assertive coworker, Mikoto must confront his past and adapt to his new circumstances. As they navigate their professional and athletic partnership, Mikoto and Tatsuru begin to rediscover their shared passion for badminton. With newfound determination, Mikoto embarks on a journey to overcome his fears and reclaim the dreams he once thought were lost forever.",
