  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dragon Boy Taro follows the journey of a young, lazy, and self-centered boy named Taro who has a penchant for eating, sleeping, and wrestling with animals. His life takes a turn when an old wizard bestows him with a magical potion that grants him the strength of a hundred men, but with a catch - it can only be used to help others. Taro's newfound purpose in life arises when he learns that his long-lost mother has been transformed into a dragon due to a curse. Inspired by Japanese art and mythology, Taro embarks on a perilous journey to find his mother and break the curse, while discovering the value of helping others along the way. With his new powers, Taro sets out to make a difference in the world, one good deed at a time.",
