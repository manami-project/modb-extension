  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earthâ€™s financial whiz, Wang Ke, is unexpectedly transported to the Shenzhou Star via his ancestral sword. With the help of his family's ancient Immortal Sun power, he navigates through life with clever mind games, a silver tongue, and a unique energy technique. Believing he's on the path to wealth, he joins the Immortal Sect, only to find himself entangled in the tumultuous undercurrents of good and evil.\n\nUsing his modern-day Earth knowledge, Wang Ke cleverly maneuvers through these conflicts, winning the hearts of beauties and building a business empire. After rescuing a powerful princess, he becomes the Sect Lord's disciple, gaining a business backer and lifting a curse that haunted him. Despite his newfound position, money remains his top priority.\n\nBalancing on the fine line between righteousness and evil, Wang Ke rises to prominent positions in both factions, all while maintaining his focus on making money with Earth's modern ways. As he steps closer to his goal of becoming the immortal king, how will this money-driven merchant influence the balance between good and evil, and the fate of the entire world? The series, initially planned for 26 episodes, was cut short after episode 19, leaving viewers in suspense.",
