    "text": "After defeating the War Gods, Ren and his friends thought they could finally return to their normal lives. But their peace is short-lived when a mysterious girl named Pandora appears with a forbidden box in tow. Pandora warns them that the box must never be opened, but an accident causes the box to open nonetheless. Now a strange phenomenon begins overtaking the world, threatening the stability Ren and his comrades fought so hard to regain. Though details remain unclear, it seems the contents of Pandora's box have set cataclysmic changes in motion. Can Ren and his allies rise to meet yet another world-altering challenge? As darkness looms, the heroes prepare to fight once more for the sake of their futures. But this time, will determination and teamwork be enough against the chaos unleashed from Pandora's forbidden box?",
