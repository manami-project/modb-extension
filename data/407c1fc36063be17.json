    "text": "Desperately yearning for her older brother's affection, Yuki and her brother, Kenji, live together in a house often devoid of parental presence. Their mundane existence takes a dramatic turn when a spectral figure emerges from Kenji's closet â€“ Hiyori, a cherished friend from their childhood. The trio's reunion is bittersweet, as Yuki's heart aches while witnessing the blossoming connection between Kenji and Hiyori, resurfacing painful memories from their past.\n\nAs children, an unwanted light blue ring held significant importance to both girls. Hiyori, who harbored dreams of becoming Kenji's bride, obtained a yo-yo to exchange for the ring. However, fate intervened, and Hiyori was forced to move away, leaving the yo-yo in Yuki's hands and the promise unfulfilled.\n\nNow, with Hiyori's ghostly return, the trio must confront their shared past and the unresolved emotions that still linger. As the complex web of love and longing unfolds, the painful love story between Kenji, Yuki, and Hiyori weaves a tale that is both heartrending and captivating.",
