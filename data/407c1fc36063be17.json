    "text": "Kenji, Yuki, and Hiyori were close childhood friends who made a promise to exchange toys - Kenji's ring for Hiyori's yo-yo. But before they could, Hiyori suddenly fell ill and moved away. Years later, Kenji is struggling with exams while living with his younger sister Yuki, who secretly loves him. One night, Hiyori mysteriously reappears...as a ghost in Kenji's closet! Though confused, Kenji and Yuki are happy to reunite with their long lost friend. However, as Kenji and ghostly Hiyori grow close again, Yuki becomes jealous, recalling the painful, unfulfilled promise from their childhood. It seems Hiyori's ghostly return and the trio's unfinished past may be connected. Will Yuki lose her brother to Hiyori once more? As Kenji gets caught between the affections of his sister and his ghostly childhood friend, a painful love story unfolds.",
