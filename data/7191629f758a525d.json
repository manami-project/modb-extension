  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows a character with ancient memories engraved on his body, prompting him to ponder existential questions about the origin and destiny of humankind. Specifically, he asks \"Where do we come from?\" and \"Where are we going?\". His pursuit of answers is like a blind journey towards wisdom, unsure if enlightenment will come. Yet he continues to seek, hoping the light will guide the way. This poetic tale of a soul seeking meaning seems to promise thoughtful themes about humanity's search for purpose and truth. The unusual concept of embodied ancestral memories suggests this anime will have creative visuals and imaginative storytelling as well. Altogether, the cryptic but evocative synopses indicate this is an anime for viewers who appreciate philosophical depth and artistic innovation. With an openness to discover where the journey may lead, the light just may shine through.",
