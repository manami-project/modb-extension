    "text": "After competing in the VF Circuit, Aichi Sendou begins attending Miyaji Academy for high school, which emphasizes preparing students for their professional futures. There, Aichi meets Naoki Ishida and introduces him to Cardfight!! Vanguard, quickly getting him hooked. Eager to spread their passion for the game, Aichi, Naoki, famous idol fighter Kourin Tatsunagi, and Aichi's longtime friend Shingo Komoi attempt to form an official Cardfight club at the school. However, the student council objects, believing the card game detracts from developing skills needed for students' careers. Undeterred, Aichi and his friends persist in trying to grow the Cardfight community at Miyaji Academy. They recruit new fighters and prepare to compete in an upcoming inter-high school Vanguard tournament, aiming to prove the game's merit despite the council's opposition. But greater threats loom, as the sinister Link Joker clan covertly targets strong Cardfight players to brainwash and strengthen their forces, setting their sights on conquering Earth after already destroying three other planets. With unwavering resolve, Aichi and his comrades continue fighting not only for themselves but the fate of the entire world.",
