  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aokura Arihisa is a high school student struggling to support his family. To make ends meet, he takes a questionable part-time job with an organization called Antares. They outfit him in a special suit and send him to wreak havoc around the city, destroying property. However, each time heroes intervene to thwart Arihisa, Antares intervenes as well, repairing his suit and putting him back on his destructive path. Though intended as a comedic premise, at its core this anime explores the lengths one might go to provide for loved ones. It sets up a complex interplay between Arihisa, Antares, the heroes, and the city itself. Each party acts in their own interests, yet they remain fatefully intertwined. As destruction inevitably yields to repair and rebuilding, the cyclical nature of the conflict comes to mirror the cycle of life. One senses that there may be more to Antaresâ€™ motivations than meets the eye. By juxtaposing lighthearted humor with thought-provoking themes, this anime promises entertainment alongside poignancy. It urges viewers to consider how they might respond when faced with no good options, yet carry on they must.",
