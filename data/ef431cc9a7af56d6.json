  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With a mind perpetually fixated on wooing the opposite sex, high school student Kippei Katakura is the epitome of a playboy. Skipping classes and employing cheesy pick-up lines are all part of his repertoire, yet his quest for the perfect partner remains elusive. However, his carefree bachelor days are about to take a dramatic turn with the arrival of his five-year-old cousin, Yuzuyu.\n\nWhen Yuzuyu's mother abandons her, the responsibility of caring for this young, vulnerable child falls squarely on Kippei's inexperienced shoulders. With no prior knowledge of childcare and a lifestyle that's far from nurturing, Kippei must navigate the steep learning curve of parenthood. Meanwhile, Yuzuyu grapples with the emotional turmoil of her mother's disappearance.\n\nAs Kippei stumbles through the challenges of raising a child, from packing school lunches to healing emotional wounds, their journey together promises to be a bumpy yet heartwarming ride. Based on Maki Youko's manga, this anime explores the transformation of a high school playboy into a responsible caregiver and the blossoming bond between two unlikely companions.",
