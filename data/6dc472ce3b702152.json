    "text": "He's the world's most notorious thief, but Lupin III is ready to leave his criminal past behind. However, a mysterious woman's debt drags him back into the game. The prize? The Super Egg, a colossal diamond concealed within the Statue of Liberty, and the Ultravirus, a powerful computer virus that could erase Lupin's criminal record forever. But Lupin isn't the only one after these prizes. A sinister cult and a brilliant young computer genius are also in the hunt, turning this high-stakes heist into a thrilling race against time. As Lupin navigates this dangerous web of intrigue, he must outsmart his rivals, uncover the secrets of the Super Egg, and secure his chance at a fresh start. Will Lupin's legendary skills be enough to triumph, or will the lure of the world's greatest treasures prove too tempting to resist?",
