  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shuchiin Academy is an elite high school that brings together the most academically gifted students, including Kaguya Shinomiya and Miyuki Shirogane. Despite expectations that the two would quickly begin dating, their intense pride prevents either from confessing their true feelings. Instead, they engage in an intricate mind game, each trying to strategically manipulate the other into confessing first. As the new school year begins, the stakes heighten. With Shirogane's birthday and student council elections approaching, Kaguya races against time to find the perfect gift and way to celebrate, without appearing too affectionate. Meanwhile, multiple rivals challenge for the student council presidency, threatening the pair's ability to spend time together. Surrounded by new friends like Chika and longtime admirers like Nagisa, Kaguya and Shirogane find their unconventional romance plagued by meddlers. Yet their stubborn refusal to be honest persists. This comedic psychological war wages on, as two geniuses foolishly prioritize their egos over their obvious love.",
