    "text": "Kumiko Yamaguchi, the granddaughter and heir of a powerful yakuza clan, has always dreamed of being a teacher. She begins a new job as a math teacher at Shirokin Academy, an all-boys high school full of delinquents. However, on her very first day, Kumiko realizes the students completely disrespect all authority figures and have no interest in learning. Undeterred, Kumiko is determined to turn class 2-4 around, using unique and unorthodox methods. Having grown up in the yakuza, she possesses incredible strength and conviction that helps earn the respect of her unruly students. However, Kumiko must keep her criminal family ties a secret or risk losing her teaching job. As Kumiko connects with her students, her biggest challenge becomes Shin, the head delinquent who begins growing suspicious of her hidden strength and background. Between resisting the vice principal's attempts to get her fired, secretly performing her yakuza duties, and gaining the trust of her eccentric class, Kumiko has quite the double life on her hands. Her goal is to become an inspirational teacher while also one day taking over as the head of her clan.",
