  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Danchigai follows the daily life of Haruki Nakano, the only brother amongst four sisters living together in an apartment complex. The siblings include level-headed eldest sister Mutsuki, difficult middle-schooler Yayoi, and mischievous young twins Uzuki and Satsuki. Though his sisters constantly play tricks and lecture Haruki, life is never boring for the sole Nakano brother. Whether facing jump scares during horror movie nights, tagging along on grocery trips, or even enduring kissing lessons, Haruki handles the antics of apartment life with his siblings in stride. Together, the five watch out for one another despite their eccentricities. Through glimpses into this lively household, Danchigai offers a heartwarming take on the everyday chaos of family. As the Nakano siblings banter and bicker their way through adolescent struggles, their enduring affection shines through.",
