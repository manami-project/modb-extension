  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Imperial Capital's fifth district is home to Kuronekotei, a quaint coffee shop where patrons are served by mechanical dolls known as automata. Once formidable weapons in a great war that concluded a few years ago, these autonomous dolls have been meticulously restored and donned in radiant kimonos, marking a new chapter in their existence.\n\nAmong these automata is Haizakura, who awakens to a world she barely recognizes following a reset that erased her memories. Despite the uncertainty surrounding her identity and past, Haizakura discovers solace in her newfound love for singing. Alongside her fellow automata—Houkiboshi, Karasuba, Gekka, and Retzel—Haizakura embarks on a journey to redefine their purpose in a post-war society.\n\nAs they navigate through the complexities of their peaceful lives, the automata grapple with the lingering echoes of their past. Yet, they remain steadfast in their pursuit of a new purpose, drawing strength from each other and the enchanting melodies that Haizakura weaves. Together, they forge a new path at Kuronekotei, embracing the tranquility that eluded them during their time on the battlefield.",
