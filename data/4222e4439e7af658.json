  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around high school girls who participate in competitive tank warfare called \"tankery.\" In the latest installment, Momo Kawashima, a former student council member at Ooarai Girls Academy, is in danger of having to repeat a year after failing her university entrance exams. Her friends hatch a plan for Momo to regain a chance at entering university - by becoming the new commander of Ooarai's tankery team and leading them to victory in the upcoming Winter Continuous Cup tournament. If Momo can demonstrate her leadership and tankery skills and guide the team to triumph, she will earn an athletic scholarship to university and avoid having to repeat high school. With Miho stepping down to allow Momo to take charge, the stakes have never been higher. As commander, Momo must unite the team and overcome their first opponents - the disorganized French-themed BC Freedom High School team - as well as other fierce rivals in tank battle. More than just Momo's academic future is on the line as the Ooarai girls fight for tank supremacy on and off the battlefield.",
