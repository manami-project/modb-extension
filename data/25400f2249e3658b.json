    "text": "After a long day working at the maid caf√© Maid Latte, Misaki Ayuzawa returns home exhausted, only to find herself plunged into further chaos. As she asks her mother to mend her torn maid uniform, her younger sister Suzuna eagerly volunteers to fix it instead. Panicked at the thought of her sister trying on the embarrassing costume, Misaki scrambles to deter Suzuna, but the inquisitive girl remains fascinated by the outfit. Just when Misaki thinks the worst is over, unexpected guests arrive at their house. Forced to juggle nosy visitors and her sister's prying curiosity, Misaki struggles to safeguard her secret job and maid uniform. Yet despite her best efforts, madcap antics ensue as guests wander the house and Suzuna persists in examining the intriguing uniform. Frazzled but quick-witted, Misaki hustles to maintain control of the escalating situation at home while keeping her job's true nature concealed. As one comedic catastrophe after another unfolds, she realizes this may be her most challenging operation yet! Will her dexterity and wit be enough to make it through the night with her dignity and secret intact?",
