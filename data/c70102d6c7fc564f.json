A diverse cast of characters with interconnected stories converge on the train, including immortals, mafia members, thieves, and more. Their interactions set off a chaotic chain of events shrouded in mystery. In the aftermath, the mafia President works to uncover what truly transpired amidst the frenzy. He questions witnesses, including some familiar faces, hoping to illuminate the strange occurrences. Meanwhile, the unhinged Graham Spector harbors a vendetta against Jacuzzi's gang over being denied his revenge on the train. However, confronting them may prove more difficult than expected. Elsewhere, the carefree thieves Isaac and Miria embark on spirited antics organizing a giant domino rally, heedless of the drama surrounding them. As the President seeks answers, Jacuzzi evades Graham's wrath, and dominos topple, the full truth of that fateful rail journey continues to emerge. Bonus stories explore enduring mysteries around immortality and the early 20th century mafia, while tying up loose ends. Key characters from the main story return, and events onboard the ancient Advena Avis ship intertwine with the Flying Pussyfoot, elucidating hidden secrets. Through it all, human lives intersect in strange and profound ways, binding them in enduring remembrance.",
