  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Russo's loyalty to Ladd is put to the test in the aftermath of the Flying Pussyfoot incident, as he seeks revenge against Jacuzzi and his group. Meanwhile, the President is still trying to uncover the truth about what happened that night, calling in familiar faces to help him piece together the puzzle. In the midst of all the chaos, Isaac and Miria remain carefree and embark on a new adventure involving a giant domino rally.\n\nThree DVD-only episodes, based on the light novels, provide further insight into the characters and events of the original series, bringing closure to the story as Carol and the Vice President return to New York.\n\nThis bonus anime is a direct sequel to \"Baccano!\", delving deeper into the themes of immortality and the mafia of the early 1930s. It also explores the mysterious train journey and the events that unfolded aboard the Advena Avis in 1711.\n\nAs Graham sets out to kidnap Eve Genoard and capture Jacuzzi, the gang takes in a mysterious woman. Meanwhile, Elmer C. Albatross pays a visit to an old friend in prison, and Czeslaw Meyer comes face to face with a man he never wanted to see again. These seemingly unrelated storylines converge, revealing the full truth behind the anomaly that occurred aboard the Advena Avis.",
