  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Embarrassed by its previous reputation as a rowdy all-boys school, Seika High has recently transitioned to a co-ed institution. At the helm of this change is Misaki Ayuzawa, the school's first-ever female student council president. Known for her strict discipline and unwavering dedication, Misaki is determined to create a safe and enjoyable environment for the few girls attending Seika High. However, her tough exterior and mastery of Aikido have earned her the nickname 'Demon President' among the boys.\n\nUnbeknownst to her peers, Misaki holds a secret: to support her struggling family, she works part-time at a maid café in Akihabara. Her double life remains hidden until Takumi Usui, the school's most popular and handsome boy, stumbles upon her workplace. With the power to expose her secret and ruin her reputation, Usui instead chooses to keep it under wraps, using it as leverage to spend more time with the fiery president.\n\nAs Usui frequents the maid café to tease and observe Misaki, she finds herself questioning his intentions. Will he continue to protect her secret, or will he eventually use it to his advantage? This romantic comedy follows the unlikely pair as they navigate the challenges of school life, reputation, and budding romance.",
