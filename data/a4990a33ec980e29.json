  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lion ized as a sci-fi masterpiece, this tale follows the journey of Ricky, a unique being known as a Zero Man, raised by a human family in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo. Sharing striking similarities with humans, Zero Men possess superior intelligence and physical prowess, while also exhibiting traits akin to squirrels. When Ricky stumbles upon a nefarious plot by his fellow Zero Men to wage war against humanity, he takes it upon himself to thwart the impending conflict and safeguard his cherished adopted family. This Shounen manga, the brainchild of Osamu Tezuka, aired from September 13th, 1959 to December 11th, 1960. Despite attempts to adapt it into a full-fledged series in 1968, budget constraints led to its unfortunate cancellation. Nevertheless, remnants of its brilliance persist in the form of concept art and storyboards.",
