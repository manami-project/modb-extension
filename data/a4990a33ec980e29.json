    "text": "This sci-fi anime centers around a young Zero Man named Ricky who was raised by humans in Tokyo. The Zero Men are an advanced species similar to humans but with greater intelligence, strength, and squirrel-like characteristics. When Ricky discovers the Zero Men are secretly planning an invasion of the human world, he is conflicted. On one hand, the Zero Men are his own kind. But his adopted human family raised him as one of their own. As tensions mount between the two species, Ricky alone holds the key to preventing catastrophic war. Both sides see him as a potential betrayer. He struggles with dual loyalties - should he remain loyal to his biological Zero Man origins or to the humans who lovingly raised him? Ricky must make a choice and then fight to stop the conflict before both sides destroy each other. The fate of the two species lies in the hands of this one conflicted Zero Man.",
