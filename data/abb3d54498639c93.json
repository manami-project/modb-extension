  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime \"Given: On the Other Hand\" is a heartwarming exploration of the deepening bond between Mafuyu Satou and Ritsuka Uenoyama, following their first live performance as a band. As they navigate the complexities of their relationship, their shared passion for music serves as a powerful connection, drawing them closer with each passing day. However, the journey is not without its challenges, as both Mafuyu and Ritsuka grapple with their own inner struggles.\n\nIncluded as a special feature with the seventh volume of the manga, this OVA offers a unique perspective on their relationship that wasn't shown in the Given movie. As summer arrives, Mafuyu dedicates his time to composing new songs for their band at Akihiko's house, while Ritsuka attends supplementary classes. This situation stirs feelings of jealousy in Ritsuka, leading the pair to make a conscious effort to spend more quality time together. From sharing joyous moments at a festival in yukatas, to impromptu sleepovers and playful interactions during band rehearsals, Mafuyu never fails to make Ritsuka's heart race. This endearing tale promises to captivate viewers with its authentic portrayal of love, friendship, and the power of music.",
