Enter Kanade Kohinata, a musical prodigy who has lost her spark, but is thrust into a world of fierce competition and camaraderie upon transferring to the academy at the insistence of her childhood friend, Ritsu Kisaragi. As Kanade navigates her new surroundings, she finds herself surrounded by twelve talented and handsome boys, all vying for the top spot in the music competition. Amidst the rigorous practices and the thrill of competition, Kanade rediscovers her passion for music and forges unforgettable memories during one extraordinary summer. But as the competition heats up, will Kanade find more than just her musical inspiration? This is a tale of youth, music, and perhaps, a hint of love.",
