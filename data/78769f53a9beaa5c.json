  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Strawhat Pirates embark on a perilous journey to Drum Island in search of medical help for their ailing crewmate, Nami. The island, once ruled by the tyrannical King Wapol, is now devoid of doctors due to his selfish actions during a pirate invasion. The only hope for Nami lies with the reclusive Dr. Kureha, who resides atop a treacherous mountain.\n\nMeanwhile, Wapol, along with his powerful older brother Mushul, a Devil Fruit user, returns to reclaim his throne. As the Strawhat Pirates ascend the mountain, they encounter Tony Tony Chopper, a half-human reindeer who was taken in by Dr. Kureha. Together, they face the formidable siblings in a battle to save not only Nami but the entire island from Wapol's tyranny.\n\nThis retelling of the Drum Island arc introduces new music, animation, and a character specially created by Oda - Mushul. Notably, Vivi is absent, while Nico Robin, Franky, and the crew's new ship, the Thousand Sunny, are included in the plot. Will the Strawhat Pirates succeed in their mission and convince Chopper to join their crew? Only time will tell.",
