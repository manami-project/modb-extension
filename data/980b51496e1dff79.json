    "text": "Accepting the self-proclaimed title of \"Japan's greatest swindler,\" Makoto Edamura finds himself in a whirlwind of trouble when a seemingly simple scam in Asakusa backfires. His mark, a French tourist named Laurent Thierry, not only outsmarts him but also leaves him penniless. Driven by revenge and the desire to reclaim his ill-gotten gains, Makoto pursues Laurent to the bustling streets of Los Angeles, only to discover that his target is an international con man with dangerous connections.\n\nAs Makoto attempts to one-up Laurent by thwarting a major drug deal, he finds himself entangled in a web of high-stakes fraud and perilous situations. The stakes are raised even higher when Makoto is left for dead, tied to the iconic Hollywood sign. Little does he know that this is just the beginning of his adventures in the treacherous world of international crime, as he becomes increasingly involved with Laurent and his eccentric associates. With his self-proclaimed title on the line, Makoto must navigate the dangerous waters of deception and intrigue, where every move could be his last.",
