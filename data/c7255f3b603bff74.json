  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in 1960s China, this animated film tells the poignant story of an elderly woman who finds herself dreaming of the past after spotting a sunset flower blooming in her garden. As the sunset bathes the sky in brilliant orange hues, memories come flooding back to her of her carefree childhood days and youthful beauty. The bloom of the delicate sunset flower transports her mind to decades earlier, when life still held the promise of new beginnings. Now in the twilight of her own life, the woman reflects on the passage of time with a mixture of nostalgia and wistfulness. Animated using traditional Chinese cutout techniques, the film's textures and colors mirror the rich memories and emotions of its central character. Though her best years may now be behind her, the dreams inspired by the sunset flower are transporting, if only for a short while.",
