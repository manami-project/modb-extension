  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fifty years after the original Hakushon Daimaou anime, Akubi, the granddaughter of the genie Hakushon, is on a journey to become the Queen of the Land of Magic. She meets Kantarou Yodama, the grandson of Kan-chan who originally discovered Hakushon's magic bottle. Kantarou and Akubi travel to the human world and go on comedic adventures, taking on jobs and learning important life lessons about the value of having dreams. They encounter obstacles in understanding modern human life, but ultimately strengthen their friendship. With slapstick humor and references to the classic series, this new anime promises to captivate fans of the Hakushon Daimaou franchise with a fresh take featuring the next generation of characters. As Akubi prepares to be queen, she must use her magical skills to guide the lazy Kantarou to recognize his own dreams.",
