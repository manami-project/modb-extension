  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the heart of their journey, Kino and Hermes, the seasoned travelers, stumble upon a peculiar city, a destination adapted from the fifth volume of the Kino no Tabi light novel series. This city, nestled within a mountain and hidden under a fabricated sky, is a stark contrast to the abandoned farmlands that surround it. The city's landscape is a spectacle of skyscrapers, advanced technology, and a strong emphasis on healthcare and hygiene, creating an environment that appears utopian.\n\nHowever, Kino's experienced eyes catch a whiff of something amiss beneath the city's pristine surface. The air carries an unusual scent, and the skies are eerily devoid of birds, replacing the expected sense of tranquility with an unsettling mystery. Despite this, Kino and Hermes are welcomed into the city after undergoing a rigorous cleaning process, a testament to the city's obsession with cleanliness.\n\nInside, they find luxurious accommodations and meet a young girl, ailing yet filled with dreams of the world beyond the city's confines. As Kino spends more time in this seemingly perfect city, they begin to question its true nature, sensing that the city's flawless facade might be hiding a deeper, darker secret.",
