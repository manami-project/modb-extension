  "synopsis": {
    "text": "An ju and Zushio, two siblings, find their idyllic life in rural Japan shattered when their father, a steward of the emperor's hunting grounds, is falsely accused of arson by a malicious local lord. Forced to flee, the family embarks on a journey to Kyoto to seek justice, but fate has a cruel twist in store. The children are separated from their mother and fall prey to deceitful bandits, who sell them into slavery.\n\nUnder the merciless rule of Sansho the Bailiff, Anju and Zushio are subjected to grueling labor and brutal punishments, pushing them to the brink of despair. As Anju mysteriously transforms into a swan, Zushio seizes an opportunity to escape. Adopted by a nobleman, he grows into a strong, determined young man, vowing to defeat the wicked Dayu and liberate the slaves, including his beloved sister.\n\nThroughout their ordeals, the siblings cling to the values their father instilled in them â€“ respect for nature and unwavering resilience. With hope as their only weapon, they strive to overcome their harsh reality and find their way back to each other and the happiness they once knew.",
