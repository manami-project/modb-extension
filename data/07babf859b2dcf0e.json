    "text": "Mikage Aya, a 16-year-old descendant of a celestial maiden named Ceres, finds herself thrust into a world of danger and supernatural powers on her birthday. Legend has it that Ceres was forced to marry a human after her heavenly robe, the key to her return to the heavens, was stolen. Now, centuries later, Aya is the reincarnation of Ceres and possesses significant tennyo blood, giving her the power to transform into the celestial maiden. However, her family, fearing the destruction Ceres could bring upon them, seeks to eliminate Aya. With the help of her protector, Yuuhi, Aya must navigate the treacherous path of controlling Ceres' powers and uncovering the truth about her family's dark history, all while dealing with unexpected romantic distractions. This thrilling tale of cosmic retribution and eternal love is further enhanced by exclusive illustrations and interviews with the original author, Yuu Watase.",
