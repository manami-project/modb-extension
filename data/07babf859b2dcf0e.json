  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ceres is a legendary celestial maiden who descended from heaven centuries ago and was forced to marry a mortal man. Their union produced a bloodline imbued with both human and celestial heritage. In modern day Tokyo, 16-year-old Aya Mikage discovers on her birthday that she is the reincarnation of Ceres. As Ceres begins to awaken within Aya, the Mikage family moves to kill her, fearing the vengeance and destruction that Ceres may bring. Aya is suddenly thrust into a battle for her own survival against the very family she once trusted. With the help of her friend Yuuhi and some rediscovered celestial powers, Aya struggles to control the wrathful spirit of Ceres while uncovering the truth about her lineage's disturbing past. Her twin brother Aki has become her enemy, consumed by his own inherited celestial powers. Aya and Aki seem fated to repeat the cycle of tragedy tied to Ceres and the Mikages across generations. Can Aya tame the vengeful angel within herself without destroying everything she holds dear? This modern day celestial legend explores love, betrayal, and the consequences of fate over countless lifetimes.",
