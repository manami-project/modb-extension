  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They were colossal beasts, once rulers of a land now forgotten, their remains petrified yet teeming with mana, a power that drew humanity and birthed civilizations. These beings, revered as 'Primordial Beasts', became the cornerstone of worship and life. Fast forward to the present, a fierce conflict ignites between the Jerle Federation, a coalition of nations devoted to these ancient creatures, and the technologically advanced Gildllan Empire. Amidst escalating tensions, Leo, a young knight-in-training of the Federation, embarks on a mission to Lunne, a town once under imperial rule, now a border settlement. Accompanied by his childhood friend and fellow trainee, Celia, and their mentor, Lisette, Leo finds himself face-to-face with Hugo, a former ally turned traitor, now a soldier of the Empire. As the flames of war rage on, the narrative of Luminaria unfolds, grappling with the theme of 'confronting antagonistic ideas of justice'.",
