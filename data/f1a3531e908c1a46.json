  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Witches with magical abilities are the world's defense against the invading alien forces known as Neuroi. But as the war persists, morale begins to dwindle, and a new approach is needed to keep hope alive. Enter the League of Nations Air Force's Music Squadron, a group of witches who use the power of music to bring smiles and comfort to those affected by the conflict.\n\nLed by retired witch Grace Maitland Steward, the Music Squadron is composed of witches who have seen success as singers, including Aila Paivikki Linnamaa and Eleonore Giovanna Gassion. Together, they recruit other witches with musical talents to join their cause, including 14-year-old Virginia Robertson, who possesses an ability too significant to ignore.\n\nThese witches, known as the Luminous Witches, don't fight on the front lines, but instead, take to stages all around the world to give hope and comfort to those who have been displaced or affected by the Neuroi attacks. Through their thrilling song and dance performances and aerial displays, they bring joy and preserve the people's smiles.\n\nWhile they may not be combatants, the Luminous Witches fight in their unique way to keep morale high and prove that music has the power to change the tides of war.",
