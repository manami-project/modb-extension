  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hanzo's adopted son, Kyouhachirou, breathes life back into two flower petals amidst a brutal ninja war between the Kouga and Iga clans, which marked the end of a three-generation succession battle in the Keichou era. These petals become Kouga Hachirou and Iga Hibiki, the children of two star-crossed lovers who were separated in the heat of battle.\n\nIn the peaceful Kan'ei era, ninjas are fading into obscurity, but the Kouga and Iga clans seek the help of Hachirou and Hibiki to reinforce their foundations. As the two young ninjas navigate their intertwined destinies, the political climate threatens to keep them apart, just as it did their parents.\n\nDespite the supposed peace between the clans, tensions rise as Tadanaga Tokugawa, represented by the Kouga, remains dissatisfied with the outcome of the final battle between Gennosuke Kouga and Oboro Iga. As the successors of their respective bloodlines, Hachirou and Hibiki face a brewing storm that could once again drive a wedge between them and their clans.",
