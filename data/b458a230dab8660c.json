Seizing the opportunity, Subaru secretly embarks on a mission to scout locations for a date with Emilia. Although wearing a disguise, he is quickly recognized by the perceptive Petra and other village children. With his initial plan foiled, Subaru reveals his intentions to the children, who excitedly lead him to a beautiful flower meadow they believe would be perfect for the date. Subaru agrees it is an ideal spot. However, with his long-awaited date approaching, worsening cold weather suddenly grips the region. The extreme drop in temperature does not seem to affect Emilia, who grows increasingly aloof. Faced with both the potential cancellation of his date and the abnormal weather, Subaru races to uncover the cause of these strange happenings before things take a dire turn.",
