  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Not your average high school student, Hoshino Koto dreams of emulating the courageous spirit of her idol, Misuzu. During a school excursion to the revered Izumo shrine, Koto's mirror mysteriously begins to glow, drawing her towards the sacred site. As danger looms, Crus, the leader of the Cosprayers, intervenes to protect her, only to be pulled into Koto's mirror. With Crus's final plea to \"help the girl,\" the world as Koto knows it vanishes.\n\nNow in an alternate reality, Koto discovers that she has unwittingly sealed away the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, leaving the world in the clutches of darkness. This realm is plagued by ominous Black Towers, guarded by malevolent creatures, which maintain Amaterasu's seal. To restore the world, Koto must join forces with the Cosprayers, a group of seven virtuous priestesses, as they confront the monstrous tower guardians.\n\nAs the newly-formed team battles heartache and betrayal, Koto's desire to be a heroine like Misuzu is put to the test. Can she find the courage within herself to save her friends and become the White Goddess of Light, or will darkness prevail? Join Koto and the Cosprayers in their epic journey to restore balance to the world.",
