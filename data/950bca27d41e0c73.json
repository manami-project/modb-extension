    "text": "Natsuki Subaru is an ordinary high school student who suddenly finds himself transported to another world. There, he is rescued by a beautiful, silver-haired girl named Satella when he is attacked by thugs. Wanting to repay Satella for saving him, Subaru offers to help find something she is looking for that was stolen from her. However, they soon find themselves facing deadly enemies and are ultimately killed. Subaru then discovers he has been granted the power \"Return by Death,\" which allows him to rewind time by dying. While Satella loses her memories of previous events each time Subaru dies and time resets, he retains all of his memories. With only Subaru aware of the time loops, he resolves to use his unique ability to protect Satella from their enemies and the burden she carries, even at the cost of his life and accumulating trauma each time he dies. Faced with violence, betrayal, and an unrelenting fate, Subaru must fight to keep Satella safe despite the loneliness of being the only one who remembers everything that has transpired. Determined to create a future where Satella can smile, Subaru wages an endless battle against the destiny that continues to doom them.",
