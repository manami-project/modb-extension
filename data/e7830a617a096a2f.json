    "text": "Mitsuki Hattori is a dedicated office worker who prioritizes her job over her personal appearance. She admires her supervisor, Watanabe, and hopes to one day become his right-hand. However, Mitsuki learns Watanabe will soon be transferring to a different section of the company. Wanting him to notice her before he leaves, she decides to put more effort into her looks. Though reliably doing her work has always been more important to Mitsuki than fashion, she now aims to show Watanabe her beauty. By improving her grooming and style, Mitsuki hopes to catch Watanabe's attention and leave him with a good final impression before his departure.",
