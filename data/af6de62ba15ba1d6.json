  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This short anime film is a creative collaboration between director Namiko Ishidate and the music group Ryokuoushoku Shakai. It was produced by TOHO Animation Studios to commemorate their 10th anniversary through a project called \"TOHO Animation Music Films,\" which featured several animated music videos from various directors and musicians. Ishidate brings her artistic flair to visualize the psychedelic rock sounds of Ryokuoushoku Shakai's song \"White Rabbit.\" Her abstract imagery and inventive transitions aim to complement the hypnotic rhythms and textures of the music. The result is a sensory experience that merges animation and music into an engaging artistic showcase. As part of a roster of inventive short films, Ishidate's music video contributes to TOHO Animation's mission to push the creative boundaries of Japanese animation. Ten years on, the studio continues to collaborate with fresh talent to produce inspired animated works that can appeal to diverse audiences.",
