    "text": "There's a heartwarming tale of an elephant father who, upon discovering his imminent journey to the afterlife, chooses to dedicate his remaining days to his cherished family. Despite the inevitable pain of his departure, he wishes for nothing more than their ability to find solace and strength in the memories they've shared. \n\nMeanwhile, a man receives the devastating news of his advanced lung cancer, leaving him with a mere six months to live. Faced with the reality of his own mortality, he embarks on a poignant journey through the final stages of his life. Unlike the solitary path chosen by elephants, this man's story unfolds in a uniquely human way. \n\nThis moving anime explores the profound themes of love, loss, and the precious memories that remain even after we've taken our final steps in this world. It invites viewers to reflect on the choices we make when faced with the inevitable, and the enduring power of family bonds.",
