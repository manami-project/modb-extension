    "text": "This poignant anime tells the story of an elephant father who receives news that he only has a short time left to live. Wanting to make the most of his final days, he chooses to spend meaningful time with his family, creating cherished memories before his inevitable passing. As he nears the end, the father hopes his family will be able to move forward after he is gone. The family struggles with grief when he finally passes, but finds solace in reminiscing about their happy times together. Though dealing with loss is difficult, the father's thoughtful wish for his family points to the permanence of the love they share even beyond death. With emotive animation and a bittersweet narrative, this anime explores the grace and heartbreak of mortality, family bonds, and finding light amid loss. More than anything, it is a celebration of the indelible power of love.",
