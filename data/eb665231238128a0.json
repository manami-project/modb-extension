    "text": "Joker is a mysterious phantom thief who uses magic and illusion to steal invaluable treasures around the world. Though authorities try every method to catch him, deploying special agents and technology, his clever tricks allow him to evade capture each time. While stealing a gem, Joker meets Hachi, an earnest ninja also after the treasure. Though seeing him as a nuisance at first, Joker is impressed by Hachi's wit and accepts him as a disciple. Now partners, they continue their heists, competing with other thieves for fame and racing to uncover a mythical treasure called the Timeslip. But with more rivals and obstacles in their way, Joker must fully embrace his role as a \"miracle-maker\" if he wishes to become the world's greatest magician thief. This globetrotting, illusion-filled caper follows a gentleman thief and his new sidekick as they stay one step ahead of the law to steal the world's greatest treasures. With suspense and tricks at every turn, it's a magical escape full of competition, rivalry, and friendship.",
