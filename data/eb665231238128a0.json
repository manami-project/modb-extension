With a repertoire of magic tricks that blur the lines between science and sorcery, he embarks on daring heists around the world, leaving authorities baffled and spectators awestruck. Despite their relentless pursuit using advanced technology and specialized agents, Joker remains one step ahead, evading capture with flair and panache.\n\nOne fateful night, while attempting to steal the coveted Dragon Gem from a tycoon's mansion, Joker crosses paths with Hachi, an endearing yet clumsy ninja.

Their ultimate goal: to claim the elusive Timeslip Treasure. As they navigate through a world filled with cunning traps, high-stakes competitions, and relentless police pursuit, Joker and Hachi strive to become the greatest 'magicians' of the night.
