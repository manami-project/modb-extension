  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chryse, a Martian city under Earth's governance, seeks independence three centuries after the devastating Calamity War between Earth and Mars. Kudelia, a determined advocate for Chryse's autonomy, embarks on a perilous journey to Earth, accompanied by members of the private security firm CGS, Mikazuki Augus and Orga Itsuka. However, their mission is disrupted when Gjallarhorn, an Earth-based military faction, launches an attack on CGS and Kudelia. Seizing the opportunity to rebel against CGS, Orga initiates a coup, thrusting Mikazuki and himself into a new conflict. To defend against Gjallarhorn's onslaught, Mikazuki activates an ancient mobile suit from the Calamity War era, the Gundam Barbatos, powered by two formidable Ahab reactors. As the sparks of a new war ignite on Mars, the actions of these young individuals may forge their own destiny and alter the course of interplanetary relations.",
