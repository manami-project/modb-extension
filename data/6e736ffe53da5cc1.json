  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seitaro Sugayama, the Japanese Prime Minister, has been a strong advocate for the widespread use of CROWDS, a system that transforms human thoughts into tangible forms, following the Tachikawa Incident that took place in Tokyo a year ago. However, not everyone shares his enthusiasm, and a sense of unease is growing among those who question the benefits of CROWDS. In the midst of this tension, a mysterious organization launches an attack on Sugayama while he is aboard a ministry vessel. As the warriors with wings prepare for a new battle, the stage is set for the thrilling events of \"Gatchaman Crowds Insight: Inbound\", which serves as the prelude to the new season and features a series of exhilarating fights, along with flashbacks that provide insight into the story.",
