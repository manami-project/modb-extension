    "text": "In the summer of 2015, a mysterious incident occurred in Tachikawa, Tokyo that granted ordinary people extraordinary powers. A year later, a system called CROWDS, developed by Berg Katze and given to Rui Ninomiya, has spread among the public, allowing anyone to utilize these powers. Japanese Prime Minister Seitaro Sugayama approved and promoted this system, believing it to benefit society. However, some remain unconvinced and view CROWDS with anxiety. Tensions surge when an unknown organization launches an attack on Sugayama's ministry vessel. As unease grows, the warriors with wings must unite against this new threat. Will CROWDS bring people together or tear society apart? The battle in Tachikawa was only the beginning. New fights now loom as super-powered factions form with opposing views of this brave new world.",
