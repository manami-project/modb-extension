  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On a sweltering summer day, a father-son duo embarks on a journey to sell their donkey at an auction, but their lack of independent thinking leads to a series of misfortunes. As they navigate through the countryside, they encounter various individuals, each with their own opinions on how the donkey should be handled. From a teahouse lady to an old man chopping wood, the pair is swayed by every suggestion, resulting in a chaotic series of events. In their attempt to appease everyone, they inadvertently drop the donkey into a river, losing their precious cargo. This engaging tale, adapted from one of Aesop's Fables, serves as a timeless reminder of the importance of independent thinking and the dangers of blindly following others' advice.",
