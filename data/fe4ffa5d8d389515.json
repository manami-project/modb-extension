  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This animated film tells the classic fable of a farmer and his son transporting their donkey to a horse auction. As they travel through the countryside, they encounter various villagers who critique how they are traveling - riding, walking, or letting the donkey go free. Eager to please, the dim-witted father and son blindly follow the advice of each passerby, eventually resulting in the donkey plunging into a river. Ultimately, this comedic satire conveys an important lesson about the foolishness of abandoning reason in order to please everyone. It reminds us to maintain clarity of thought and purpose rather than being swayed this way and that by the opinions of others. This timeless message continues to ring true nearly a century after this animated adaptation of Aesop's ancient fable was produced.",
