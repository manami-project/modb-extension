    "text": "Youko Shimorenjaku's pet bat, Chi-chan, is the last thing Takuya Isurugi expects to encounter on his first day as an aircraft mechanic for the 801st Tactical Training Squadron, an all-female aerial acrobatics team. Led by the stern veteran pilot Mitsuru Konishi, the squadron, known as the Airbats, is a motley crew of misfits, including hot-headed Miyuki Haneda, karaoke-loving Arisa Mitaka, gambling enthusiast Sakura Saginomiya, and the perpetually feuding Haneda and Mitaka, who both find themselves attracted to the newcomer, Takuya. Facing constant scrutiny from the Japanese Air Self-Defense Force and the threat of disbandment, the Airbats must put aside their differences and work together to prove their worth. With Takuya's infectious enthusiasm for anime and aircraft, can this ragtag group of women pull it together and save the Airbats from being grounded forever?",
