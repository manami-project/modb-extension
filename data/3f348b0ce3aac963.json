    "text": "Idol group ST☆RISH, including Otoya Ittoki and his fellow members, have been putting in relentless effort into their performances, interviews, and commercials, leaving them in need of a well-deserved break. To commemorate their 10th anniversary and the Uta no☆Prince-sama♪ Maji Love ST☆RISH Tours film, their advisors invite them on a luxurious camping trip, known as \"glamping.\" This glamorous getaway offers the perfect opportunity for the boys to unwind and strengthen their bond around a cozy campfire before embarking on their next grand adventure.",
