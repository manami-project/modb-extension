  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wish-granting deity Yato finds himself in a bit of a bind. Lacking a shrine, worshippers, and even a divine weapon, he's resorted to offering his services for a mere five yen a task. His fortunes begin to change when he crosses paths with Hiyori, a schoolgirl who saves him from an oncoming vehicle but loses her life in the process. Miraculously, she returns to the living, but her soul becomes unstable, frequently slipping out of her body. Desperate to return to normal, Hiyori enlists Yato's help, but the god needs a new divine weapon before he can assist her. As they embark on a quest to find one, they stumble upon a world of spirits and gods, and uncover secrets from Yato's past that hint at a darker, more complex history. Will Yato and Hiyori succeed in their mission, or will the challenges they face prove too great for this unlikely duo? Join them on their journey and discover the truth about the mysterious Yato and the world he inhabits.",
