When the evil inventor dog Dekapoo sets his sights on locating the legendary Bobobobobone, a bone imbued with world domination powers, it's up to Shiro to track it down first. By day, he resides with the average Nohara family, but when trouble calls, mild-mannered Shiro transforms into the crime-fighting canine sworn to protect the Bobobobobone from those who would misuse its abilities. With the megalomaniacal Dekapoo developing dastardly schemes to find the bone, Shiro races against time on an exciting quest to secure the Bobobobobone and safeguard the planet he calls home. Can one good boy beat the inventor at his own game and save the world from a nefarious fate? Tune in to find out!",
