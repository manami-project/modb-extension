  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story unfolds in the realm of Soul Shell, a world of suspended islands that shield humanity from the abyss. In this world, songs possess the power to mend injuries and perform miracles, a power that the young Reyvateil, Aurica, struggles to harness. Her life takes a dramatic turn when Lyner, a fighter from the lofty tower of Ar Tonelico, crash-lands his airship near her.\n\nIn a quest to repair his damaged vessel, Lyner and Aurica embark on a journey, encountering treacherous monsters and dubious engineers. As they navigate these challenges, Lyner unintentionally reveals to Aurica the true essence of singing: a genuine desire to aid others.\n\nThis tale is based on the RPG game of the same name and explores a time when the world has forgotten the extraordinary power of songs, once believed to be the core of existence. Aurica and Lyner's adventure becomes a test of survival, self-discovery, and a rekindling of faith in the power of songs. Will they manage to repair Lyner's airship and restore Aurica's belief in her abilities? Only time will tell.",
