  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One sunny day in the bustling harbor town of Yokohama, a curious red brick, nestled in the corner of an old red brick building, decides to embark on an adventure. Having spent countless years listening to the rhythmic clatter of geta sandals echoing through the busy streets, the brick yearns to experience the unknown and witness the world beyond its familiar corner.\n\nAs the brick lies just a few blocks from the vibrant harbor, it's no surprise that it has absorbed the infectious energy and desire to explore that fills the air. Inspired by memories of a distant white sailboat gracefully entering the port when the building was still new, the brick can no longer resist the allure of the sea.\n\nIn Harbor Tale, a captivating short film by Yuuichi Itou, the red brick breaks free from its stationary existence and sets out on a heartwarming journey along the harborfront. Combining the magic of stop motion and CG animation, this enchanting tale brings the brick to life, inviting viewers to join in its quest for discovery and delight.",
