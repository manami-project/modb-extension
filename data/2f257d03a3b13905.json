  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Milk-chan, a boisterous and self-centered five-year-old superheroine, shares her unconventional home, precariously perched on the side of a building, with her quirky companions - Tetsuko, an anxious robot with a bottle-like appearance, and Hanage, a green, mustachioed blob. Living beyond her means, Milk-chan often finds herself unable to pay rent, even resorting to unsuccessful blackmail attempts on local ants. Salvation comes in the form of secret missions from the President, which Milk-chan eagerly accepts, hoping to earn some cash.\n\nEmbarking on wild escapades that pay homage to 1970s spy thrillers, the trio encounters everything from time loops and drug busts at amusement parks to dealing with boys behaving bizarrely. With Milk-chan's bold attitude, Tetsuko's paranoia, and Hanage's peculiar presence, every adventure is a chaotic rollercoaster ride. The missions commence after Milk-chan's unique phone etiquette, involving a pretend 'Bank of Hokkaido' greeting, followed by a swift takeoff in their 'Milk-6' helicopter. Brace yourself for an unpredictable, laugh-out-loud journey with this eccentric trio!",
