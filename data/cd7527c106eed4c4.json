    "text": "Yukino and Kanade Sakurai are twin sisters sharing a dorm room at their high school. They enjoy a close bond, spending much of their free time together with friends. However, their relationship begins to shift when an underclassman named Sakuya Kamiyama admits to Yukino that she has long admired her from afar. Meanwhile, Kanade learns of Sakuya's affection for her sister from a friend. Although innocent at first, these revelations plant seeds of change. Yukino soon finds herself viewing Kanade differently, realizing the depth of her love. As Sakuya continues seeking Yukino's attention, Kanade grapples with newfound feelings of jealousy. She questions if her sister desires a new companion. Despite Sakuya driving a wedge between the twins, it also helps Yukino acknowledge and confess her romantic feelings for Kanade. The once-platonic siblings must now navigate altering their relationship and dealing with the presence of an outsider vying for one sister's attention.",
