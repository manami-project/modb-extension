  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Eizou Hakusho II is a four-part OVA series that provides deeper insight into the main characters of the popular anime Yu Yu Hakusho. Each volume spotlights one of the four protagonists - Yusuke, Kurama, Hiei, and Kuwabara - recapitulating their journey and involvement in the story thus far. The volumes open with short, stylized music videos set to songs performed by the characters' voice actors. These provide a glimpse into each character's personality and background. The rest of the runtime showcases handpicked scenes from previous episodes, emphasizing the highlighted character's iconic moments and character growth. Interspersed throughout are exclusive new animation sequences and interviews with the prolific voice cast. Together, the four installments of Eizou Hakusho II serve both as a highlight reel of the most memorable sequences from this classic shonen anime as well as an intimate look at what makes each of these four fighters so compelling. Both longtime fans and newcomers alike will find an entertaining and illuminating portrayal of the characters that form the heart of Yu Yu Hakusho.",
