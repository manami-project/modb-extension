  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fumizuki Academy is not your typical high school. It follows a unique system where students are categorized into different classes based on their test scores. At the bottom of this hierarchy is Class F, filled with underachievers and misfits, including Akihisa Yoshii, the epitome of an 'idiot.' The facilities in Class F are as dismal as the students' scores: worn-out tatami mats, rickety tables, and outdated equipment. However, a beacon of hope exists in the form of Mizuki Himeji, one of the smartest students in the school, who ended up in Class F due to a fever on test day.\n\nIn this academy, classes can challenge each other to summon battles, using fantasy creatures whose power levels correspond to the students' test scores. Led by their class president, Yuuji Sakamoto, Class F decides to take on the higher-ranked classes in a bid to claim their luxurious facilities. As they navigate through these battles, the students of Class F find themselves in a myriad of bizarre situations, their camaraderie and resilience tested at every turn. Will they manage to climb up the ranks and claim the coveted Class A's luxuries, or will they remain at the bottom of the school hierarchy? Only time will tell in this thrilling and comedic tale of friendship, determination, and a touch of absurdity.",
