    "text": "Deep in the lush Okoya Forest lives a troop of the Mythical Pokémon Zarude, who fiercely protect their jungle paradise from intruding humans. But one Zarude breaks the rules by adopting an orphaned human baby found in the forest. Named Koko, the boy grows up believing he's a Zarude too. Koko's world turns upside down when he befriends a human trainer named Ash and his Pikachu. For the first time, Koko questions his Pokémon identity. Meanwhile, the forest comes under threat from encroaching human development that harms the Pokémon habitat. As danger looms, Koko discovers the true meaning of family. He must unite with both the troop of Zarude and his new human friends to save their shared home. In the process, the bonds between Pokémon and human are tested as Koko determines whether he is Pokémon or human at heart.",
