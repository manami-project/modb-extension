  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When five wealthy teenage girls - Miyuki, Reika, Youko, Nina, and Kimiko - enroll in Seika Girls' High School, they find themselves under police protection due to a menacing videotape they've received. Unwilling to be confined, the girls cleverly outsmart the police, only to find themselves confronted by armed terrorists. As members of the school's Debutante Detective Corps, they must use their wit, unique abilities, and a touch of psychic power to outmaneuver their attackers in a fight that's equal parts Street Fighter parody and Gunslinger Girls. With a 40-foot giant ex-Avenger on the loose and a ticking time bomb disguised as a sculpture, our heroines must save the day without smudging their manicures. Will they rise to the challenge and thwart the terrorists, or will their high-stakes escapade end in disaster? Only time will tell in this thrilling and silly adventure.",
