    "text": "Jill is unexpectedly sent back in time six years after being sentenced to death by her fianc√©, the crown prince. Seeking to alter her fate, she impulsively proposes to Emperor Hadis, her former archenemy. Though Jill knows Hadis will eventually descend into villainy, the current Hadis is overjoyed by her proposal. After retracting her hasty offer, Jill is treated to a meal by the delighted Hadis. Captivated by his cooking, she makes a pivotal decision - rather than allowing Hadis to become evil, she will reform him and ensure his happiness. With newfound resolve, Jill sets out to rewrite their intertwined futures for the better.",
