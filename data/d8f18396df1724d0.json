    "text": "Taikai Hiro's life takes an unexpected turn when he stumbles upon a seemingly ordinary golden lighter near a riverbank. Unbeknownst to him, this lighter is not what it appears to be; it is Gold Lightan, a powerful robot hailing from the Robot Dimension. When the Earth is threatened by the malevolent King Ibaruda and his mechanical minions, Gold Lightan transforms into the formidable Golden Warrior to defend the planet. Joined by Hiro and his brave friends, known as the One Pack Rangers, they form an unbreakable alliance to thwart King Ibaruda's sinister plans for world domination, setting the stage for an epic battle with the fate of Earth hanging in the balance.",
