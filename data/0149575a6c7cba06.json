  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Uiba is the daughter of a pet shop owner who is disheartened when some reptile eggs fail to hatch. To cheer her up, Uiba's father purchases a large, striped egg that miraculously hatches into a green dinosaur that Uiba names \"Muka Muka\" after the sounds he makes. Muka Muka quickly becomes the talk of the town, intriguing the eccentric local professor. Using one of his strange inventions, a time machine, the professor transports Uiba's family and other neighborhood residents back to prehistoric times. There, they encounter other dinosaurs and magical beings, sparking a series of adventures. As Uiba bonds with the energetic Muka Muka, she and her friends, including her childhood companion Senta and older friend Hazuki, learn to navigate life in the prehistoric world. Their journeys teach them valuable lessons about friendship, wonder, and embracing the unexpected.",
