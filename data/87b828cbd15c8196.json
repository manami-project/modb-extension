  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After becoming stranded on a deserted island, the female students of Class Black find themselves thrust into a high-stakes competition. The rules are simple yet perilous - the first girl to remove Haru's swimsuit top will have her heart's desire granted. However, with wardrobe malfunctions running rampant, Haru's dignity hangs in the balance. It's up to her stalwart friend Tokaku to defend her honor in this island game where anything goes and rules barely apply. Though details are scarce, additional footage related to the series is slated for future release. A special 13th episode will have a preview screening on November 22nd, 2014 in Tokyo before its Blu-ray/DVD release on December 17th of that year. The original plot of episode 13 takes place on an uninhabited island as well. Here, the female students participate in a survival game to capture their classmate Haru, with Tokaku declaring she absolutely cannot afford to lose this round.",
