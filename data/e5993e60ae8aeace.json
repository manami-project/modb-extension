  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime explores the interplay of light, shadows, and objects. It posits that where there is light and an object, there must also be a shadow. The shadow serves as proof of the object's existence - if the shadow disappears, then the object itself must also be gone. The anime also touches on the theme of loss, centered around a young girl. She walks in her own footprints but beside them is another set that suddenly ends, hinting at a departed loved one. The girl encounters shadowy memories that fade when she reaches out to grasp them. There is a sense of quiet melancholy surrounding her as she copes with this absence in her life. Though sparse on plot details, the anime seems to use light and shadow metaphorically to muse on themes of presence, absence, memory, and loss. The visuals likely complement the wistful, contemplative tone. While the full story remains unclear, the synopses convey a thoughtful, bittersweet mood that suggests this short film may appeal to fans of subtle, experiential storytelling.",
