  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aired alongside Tamako Love Story in theatres, this heartwarming tale brings back Dera Mochimazzi, the beloved talking bird from Tamako Market. After an extended sojourn in the Usagiyama Shopping District, where he indulged a bit too much in his favorite mochi treats, Dera returns to his tranquil life on the southern islands. There, he shares his days filled with gentle slapstick humor with his companions, the regal Prince Mecha and the endearing Choi. This delightful short offers a glimpse into the everyday life of Dera, a character who, though often in the shadows, has captured the hearts of many.",
