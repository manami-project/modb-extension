  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime unfolds in a world teetering on the brink of calamity, triggered five years ago by the invasion of alien beings, the 'Kiseichuu'. These creatures sap humans of their sexual energy, or 'H-energy', leaving them devoid of the will to live. To combat this threat, a device known as HxEros has been developed, harnessing the power of ecchi (H) and erotic energy (Ero) to counter the Kiseichuu.\n\nEnter Retto Enjou, a high school student, and his estranged childhood friend, Kirara Hoshino. Caught in a skirmish with a 'Censor Bug', a Kiseichuu that thrives on human sexual energy, they manage to defeat it and decide to join the ranks of the HxEros force. This group of heroes, including four captivating schoolgirls, uses their erotic power to battle the monsters and safeguard humanity.\n\nLiving in a house brimming with lustful girls, Retto's erotic energy is consistently replenished, ensuring he's always combat-ready. Together, they strive to maintain high levels of libido to power their gear, forming a united front against the Kiseichuu's deadly plan to extinguish the human race. This ecchi love comedy manga adaptation promises a unique blend of humor, romance, and high-stakes battles.",
