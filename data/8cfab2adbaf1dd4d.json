    "text": "Two years of tranquility have enveloped Yokohama, thanks to Milky Holmes' successful recovery of their Toys and the capture of most phantom thieves. The city's peace, however, is disrupted by the emergence of a new band of phantom thieves, Colour the Phantom, who declare war on its detectives. Enter Kazumi and Alice, two detective academy students and childhood friends who idolize Milky Holmes. They form their own detective team, the Feathers, aspiring to become great detectives like their heroes. Meanwhile, the once-active Genius 4 members find themselves relegated to desk jobs, their glory days seemingly behind them. As the new generation of detectives, the Feathers aim to restore peace to Yokohama and prove themselves worthy of the Milky Holmes legacy.",
