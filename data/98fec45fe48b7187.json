  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jiang Ziya was once a top commander in the divine Kunlun army, tasked with eliminating the dangerous Nine-Tailed Fox Demon that threatened mortal existence. On the cusp of victory, he discovered that an innocent young girl was trapped within the demon. Unable to harm her, Jiang Ziya freed the Fox Demon, an act of mercy that led to his banishment from the heavens. Ten years later, Jiang Ziya crosses paths with a mysterious girl named Xiao Jiu, who bears an uncanny resemblance to the one he saved. When he notices she wears the Fox Demon's bracelet, Jiang Ziya wonders if Xiao Jiu holds the key to the truth he has sought for so long. Together, they embark on a daunting journey to Mount Youdu that may finally reveal what transpired on that fateful day, and perhaps offer Jiang Ziya a second chance to reclaim his place amongst the gods. But greater revelations and more difficult choices await, as Jiang Ziya confronts his past and decides what future he wants to claim.",
