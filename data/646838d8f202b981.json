  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After years of scheming, the immortal Naraku leader Utsuro has set in motion an intricate plan to destroy the Earth and himself along with it. By destabilizing planets across the universe, he has drawn the Altana Liberation Army to Earth for a final apocalyptic battle. With the capital city Edo in chaos, the government crippled, and allies scattered, former resistance fighter Gintoki Sakata and his ragtag team face the monumental task of uniting friends and foes alike to defend their home. Outgunned but never outmatched thanks to Gintoki's unconventional tactics and steadfast commitment to protecting his found family, this band of odd-jobs laborers will fight to the last man if that's what it takes to save the land they love. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as two cosmic forces collide in an epic showdown between an immortal orchestrating armageddon and a humble samurai who still carries the soul of old Japan within him. Win or lose, one thing's for sure - with Gintoki on the frontlines, this war will be anything but boring!",
