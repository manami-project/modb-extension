  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime is set in an alternate universe that diverges from the main storyline after the fourth season. It is a collaboration between the Kamiusagi Rope series and a Japanese cellphone company called AU. The storyline focuses on the characters Rope and Akira interacting with modern mobile technology like cellphones. The episodes explore them using features like texting, cameras, and apps in humorous ways. These comedic special episodes were originally released as DVD extras after Kamiusagi Rope's fourth season. They offer fans a fun glimpse at the characters in a more contemporary setting, while also serving as an advertisement for AU's products and services. Though separate from the main plot, this crossover highlights the appeal of the Kamiusagi Rope series and potentially attracts new anime viewers. With creative concepts and engaging character dynamics, it encapsulates the spirit of the franchise beyond the canon narrative.",
