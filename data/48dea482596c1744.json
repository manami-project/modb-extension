  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seitarou Usagi, a rabbit, Risu, a squirrel, Kuma, a bear, and Penguin, a penguin, form a courageous squad of young animals known as U-Ri-Ku-Pen, dedicated to rescuing other animals in distress. Alongside them are a diverse group of members including a dog, a boar, a deer, a koala, a mouse, a seagull, and a lion, all of whom work together to complete their missions. The team's success is rewarded with prizes, and viewers are encouraged to participate by guessing which animal will save the day each week.\n\nIn another iteration, these brave animals are known as the Jungle Patrol, comprised of Donny Deer, Barney Bear, Scooter Squirrel, Seitarou Rabbit, Harry Hog, and Pete Penguin. Under the leadership of Lion King Leo, they strive to maintain law and order in the jungle. Whenever danger arises or a jungle creature needs help, the patrol is ready to take action. However, their mission is often hindered by the sinister Grabbel, Wolf Tooth, and their cronies, who are always causing chaos in the jungle. Despite the challenges, the members of the patrol remain fearless and determined to carry out their duties.",
