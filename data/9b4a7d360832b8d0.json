  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Meiji era has dawned after years of bloody conflict, yet some are still haunted by the ghosts of the past. Kenshin Himura, once known as the feared assassin \"Hitokiri Battousai,\" now wanders Japan seeking atonement. But when a chance encounter in Yokohama pits Kenshin against Shigure Takimi, a hardened revolutionary plotting to overthrow the new government, the rurouni's vow never to kill again is put to the ultimate test. Shigure watched his friends die fighting for the revolution that brought forth the prosperity and progress of the Meiji era. Now disillusioned, with vengeance in his heart, he leads a rogue band of rebels to undo that which so many sacrificed their lives to achieve. Upon discovering Kenshin's true identity, Shigure's personal loss fuels his vendetta. Two men bound by the scars of war, each clinging to their ideals at any cost. Their fated duel becomes a fight not just for the future, but for coming to terms with the past. Can redemption pierce a heart hardened by grief? The age of the sword has ended, but the age-old battle between justice and retribution rages on.",
