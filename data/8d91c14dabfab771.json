  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Allen is a boy who was unable to receive a divine Gift, leading his powerful family to see him as a failure and banish him from their duchy. However, Allen has a secret - he retains the memories and powers from his past life as a legendary hero. Now freed from his family's expectations, Allen hopes to finally live a peaceful, carefree life. That wish is short-lived when Allen crosses paths with Liz, his former fiancée. When a monster attacks Liz, Allen uses his powers to save her life. But rather than turning him back over to his family, Liz hires Allen as her bodyguard for a dangerous quest she must undertake. Though Allen wanted nothing more than to relax in this new life, destiny seems to have other plans. With his former fiancée at his side, this banished hero finds himself embarking on an unexpected new adventure.",
