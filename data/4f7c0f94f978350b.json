    "text": "Think you're prepared for the chaotic world of Popuko and Pipimi? Brace yourself for a wild ride with these petite and towering stars of Pop Team Epic! Inspired by Bukubu Okawa's eccentric four-panel webcomic, this anime serves up a comedy that defies expectations with its outrageous humor and absurd antics.\n\nFollowing their successful attempt to create their very own anime production, these high school girls return with their unhinged shenanigans. With zero consideration for their audience, they continue to live their unpredictable daily lives, filled with side-splitting comedy skits and over-the-top parodies.\n\nNo one is safe from their hilarious escapades, not even the unfortunate live actor Shouta Aoi. Caught in the wrong series while trying to play the hero, he finds himself entangled in their madness.\n\nPop Team Epic dives into another round, bringing back the contrasting dynamics of Popuko and Pipimi. As they enjoy their amusing everyday life, they leave a trail of chaos in their wake. Are you ready to experience this unconventional comedy? Think again!",
