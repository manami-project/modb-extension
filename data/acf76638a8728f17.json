  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Orphen's journey begins as a gifted sorcerer at the Tower of Fang, where he trains alongside his beloved foster sister, Azalie. When an experiment to harness forbidden magic transforms Azalie into a fearsome dragon, the Tower's administration casts her out and covers up the incident. Disillusioned, Orphen abandons his studies to find a way to restore Azalie's true form.\n\nYears later, Orphen has traded his magical ambitions for a lackadaisical life as a moneylender. When a client's marriage fraud scheme unexpectedly leads him to Azalie, Orphen's quiet existence is shattered. Determined to save his sister, he finds himself caught between ruthless hunters seeking to kill the dragon and his own mission to break the curse.\n\nJoined by an unexpected ally in Cleao, an heiress who insists on accompanying him, and his apprentice Majic, Orphen navigates a world of magic, monsters, and deception. As he unravels the truth behind Azalie's transformation, Orphen must confront his former mentor and friends turned foes. With time running out, Orphen will stop at nothing to save his sister and uncover the secrets that lie at the heart of the Tower of Fang.",
