    "text": "Sawa is a young schoolgirl who tragically lost her parents to a brutal murder. She is subsequently taken in by Akai, a corrupt policeman who trains her to become a contract killer. Together with his friend Kanie, they recruit vulnerable youths and equip them with special weapons to carry out assassinations against dishonest celebrities, dangerous criminals that evade justice, and other targets of their choosing. Sawa complies in the hopes that Akai will help her avenge her parents' deaths. During an assignment, she meets Oburi, another youth who works for Akai after losing his family. A friendship blooms between the two as they bond over their grief and discontentment with their bloody line of work. When Akai orders Sawa to kill Oburi, their friendship is put to the test. With a chance encounter that shakes the foundations of her conviction, Sawa must make a fateful choice - continue living under Akai's ruthless control or grasp at freedom with Oburi, even if it means becoming the target herself. As two lost souls caught in a web of violence, they dream of breaking free and taking back their stolen futures.",
