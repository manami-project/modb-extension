  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sadako from \"The Ring\" is the last person you'd want to be compared to, but for Kuronuma Sawako, it's an unfortunate reality. Her striking resemblance to the horror icon has made her an outcast among her peers, who misinterpret her shy demeanor as malevolent. Yearning for friendship and normalcy, Sawako finds herself drawn to Kazehaya Shouta, the charismatic and beloved class heartthrob. When Kazehaya begins to engage with her, Sawako dares to hope for the friendships she's always desired, and perhaps even a hint of romance. However, as she navigates her newfound social circle, she must confront the challenges and misunderstandings that come with it, while also grappling with unfamiliar feelings towards the boy who sparked her transformation.",
