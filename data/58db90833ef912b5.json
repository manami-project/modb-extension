  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a dystopian future version of Saitama, Japan, ninjas once ruled with ruthless authority during an age of tranquility in the past. However, some ninjas committed forbidden ritual suicide, storing their souls at Kinkaku Temple for future resurrection. Their true history was hidden from the public. In present-day Neo-Saitama, where cybernetics and technology reign supreme, these ancient ninja souls are suddenly unleashed from the temple. Kenji Fujikido is a salaryman whose wife and child were killed amidst ninja turf wars. After nearly dying himself, Fujikido becomes possessed by the soul of a mysterious ninja known as Naraku. Granted a second chance at life, he is reborn as the Ninja Slayer - a Grim Reaper destined to kill malevolent ninjas. Fueled by revenge and locked in personal war, the Ninja Slayer confronts ninjas from the Soukai Syndicate in the neon-bathed back alleys of Neo-Saitama.",
