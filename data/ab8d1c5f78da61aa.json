    "text": "Miia, a captivating Lamia, moves in with ordinary teenager Kimihito Kurusu as part of a government exchange program, turning his mundane life upside down. In this alternate reality, Japan pioneers the integration of mythical creatures into society, including harpies, centaurs, and cat girls. As Miia's caretaker, Kimihito must navigate the complexities of interspecies laws and the challenges of cohabitating with an ever-growing harem of enchanting, amorous creature-girls. The Interspecies Exchange Act forbids sexual relations between species, but an experimental marriage provision offers a tantalizing loophole. With new species frequently appearing and unpredictable events unfolding, Kimihito's life becomes a thrilling rollercoaster of desire, laughter, and interspecies diplomacy. Will he successfully navigate this bewildering world while keeping his hormones in check?",
