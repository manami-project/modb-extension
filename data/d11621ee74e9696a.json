    "text": "After a failed Federation mission, Gundam pilot Amuro Ray and his battalion find themselves stranded on a remote island known as the Island of No Return. Originally sent to intercept potential Zeon forces, they discover instead a group of children and a single Zaku mobile suit. Amuro soon encounters the eccentric Cucuruz Doan, who seems to be connected to the island's secrets. When Amuro investigates further, he and his comrades face grave danger. This film explores the untold stories behind the mysterious 15th episode of the original Gundam series, providing a fresh take on the enigmatic Island of No Return. Through Amuro's eyes, we discover the island's hidden past and its implications for the future of the Federation's war with Zeon. Will Amuro escape the island alive? And what revelations await him on this land lost to time?",
