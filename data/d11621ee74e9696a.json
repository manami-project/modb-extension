  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Instead of encountering Zeon adversaries, Mobile Suit pilot Amuro Ray and his team stumble upon a group of children and a lone Zaku Mobile Suite on the enigmatic Island of No Return. As they navigate this unexpected turn of events, Amuro crosses paths with the mysterious Cucuruz Doan, whose presence is deeply connected to the island's hidden secret. With danger looming, Amuro must find a way to escape the island and protect the children, all while unraveling the truth behind Cucuruz Doan. This film offers a fresh perspective on the iconic 15th episode of the original Mobile Suit Gundam anime, which has been notably absent from English releases of the series.",
