When ex-cop Chikara Doumeki joins the group as Yashiro’s bodyguard, there is an instant yet complicated attraction. Yashiro makes advances towards the stoic Doumeki, who is impotent yet drawn to his boss’s beauty. However, Doumeki’s traumatic past makes him reluctant to get involved with a subordinate. As they spend more time together, glimpses into their dark pasts are revealed. Yashiro was deeply hurt by the only person he ever loved. Doumeki carries his own scars. Will the two be able to move beyond their emotional wounds to explore a real connection? Or will their complex histories and yakuza ties doom a possible romance? This yakuza drama blends action, suspense and romance between two damaged yet magnetic characters who find themselves engaged in a delicate dance of desire and self-protection.",
