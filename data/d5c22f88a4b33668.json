  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the cold-hearted leader of the Shinsekai yakuza group, Yashiro is not one to show vulnerability or form close bonds. However, beneath his ruthless exterior lies a secret masochistic desire and a longing for connection that even he cannot fully understand. Enter Chikara Doumeki, a former cop and ex-con who is hired as Yashiro's new bodyguard. Despite Yashiro's initial reservations about getting involved with a subordinate, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to Doumeki's stoic demeanor and clumsy charm. But as Yashiro's advances are repeatedly rejected, he begins to uncover the personal demons that haunt Doumeki's past. Will Yashiro be able to break through Doumeki's emotional walls and forge a genuine connection, or will their complicated histories tear them apart? In \"Twittering Birds Never Fly,\" the lines between pain and pleasure, love and loyalty, are blurred in a gripping tale of two men bound by duty and desire.",
