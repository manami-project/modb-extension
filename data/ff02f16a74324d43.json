    "text": "Rinka Urushiba is a normal high school girl struggling to make ends meet by working part-time to support herself and her unemployed father in Tokyo. Her life takes an extraordinary turn when she witnesses a flying penguin and glowing fish swimming through the sky. After passing out when one of the fish phases through her, Rinka awakens with the ability to phase through solid objects, though her hair turns white whenever she uses her newfound power. Rinka soon learns that others have developed superhuman abilities that same day, including her classmate Kyoutarou who can teleport. When a series of unexplained crimes puts the city in danger, Rinka and Kyoutarou decide to use their new abilities to fight back against evil espers abusing their powers. Dubbed the \"White Girl\" by the public, Rinka finds her sense of justice tested as the stakes continue to rise against powerful foes with sinister plans. Alongside Kyoutarou, she resolves to harness her gift to protect people and make a difference in Tokyo.",
