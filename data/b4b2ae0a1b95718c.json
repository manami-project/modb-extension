    "text": "The beautiful Princess Snow White, known for her milk-white complexion, is born into the Kingdom of Greenvalley. On her fourth birthday, she receives three adorable pets: Milk, a milk-craving puppy; Pocket, a pocket-sized kitten; and Cuc√π, a cooing dove. Tragedy strikes when her mother, Queen Rosebud, falls ill and passes away, leaving the King to remarry a stunningly beautiful woman named Chrystel. As Snow White blossoms into a young beauty, Chrystel's envy grows, leading her to reveal her true, malevolent nature.\n\nWhen King Conrad leaves for war, the wicked Chrystel seizes the opportunity to target Snow White, forcing the young princess to flee the castle. Lost in the woods, Snow White encounters seven kind-hearted dwarfs who offer her refuge in their cozy cottage. Prior to her harrowing escape, Snow White finds solace in the company of a charming noble, Prince Richard, but their blossoming friendship is cut short by an unexpected separation.\n\nIn the absence of her beloved pets and the handsome prince, Snow White forms a genuine bond with her newfound friends, the dwarfs. However, the threat of her cruel stepmother still looms, making Snow White's journey a perilous one, filled with danger, friendship, and the hope of love.",
