  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Junpei is a high school student and member of the film club along with his friends. The group heads to a cabin to film a movie based on a script written by his friend Toujou. On the way there, Junpei gets separated from the others with Toujou during a storm and they take shelter in an abandoned building. Later on the trip, the club plays a \"test of courage\" game which presents opportunities for Junpei to get closer with his love interest, Nishino. It seems Junpei finds himself in fortunate yet precarious situations being alone with the girls he has affections for. This story picks up where the previous anime series left off and revolves around Junpei navigating various scenarios on the club trip that put his relationships and restraint to the test. The lighthearted awkwardness and comedic mishaps promise an entertaining viewing experience.",
