  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ard Meteor, formerly known as the invincible Demon Lord Varvatos, once ruled supreme, but his unrivaled power left him yearning for a simple, ordinary life. Reincarnating as a villager, he hoped to blend in and find true companionship. However, even after intentionally diminishing his powers, Ard remains incomparably stronger than his contemporaries in this new era of dwindling magic.\n\nAs whispers of his extraordinary abilities spread, he becomes the center of attention, attracting admirers, royal invitations, and even the wrath of a former minion. Despite his attempts to maintain a low profile, Ard's dreams of a peaceful life seem to slip further away as he navigates through unexpected challenges and encounters. Will the once-feared Demon Lord ever manage to achieve the mundane existence he so desperately craves?",
