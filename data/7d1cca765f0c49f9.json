  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an alternate Edo-era Japan, legendary swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki forged twelve powerful \"Deviant Blades\" - swords so extraordinarily powerful that one man could defeat an army with one. When the shogun emerged victorious after a past rebellion, he collected 988 of Shikizaki's swords. But those were merely practice pieces compared to the final twelve. Desperate to collect the legendary Deviant Blades and secure power for the shogunate, strategist Togame hires Shichika Yasuri, a master of the unique Kyotouryuu sword technique who fights with his own body as a blade. Living peacefully in exile with his sister Nanami, Shichika is uninterested in Togame's political motivations, but agrees to help her out of curiosity and growing affection. Together, Togame and Shichika must best the twelve deadly wielders of the Deviant Blades. With the future of Japan at stake, the unlikely duo heads out on an epic adventure fraught with peril - but also with the promise of forging an unbreakable bond. Through Kyotouryuu sword mastery and tactical brilliance, can Togame and Shichika collect all twelve Deviant Blades and change the course of history?",
