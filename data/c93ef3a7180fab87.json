  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the sun sets, a father and daughter ascend a ridge in Japan, eagerly anticipating the moonrise. While they wait, an elderly man shares a poignant tale from his past. The narrative unfolds the unlikely bond between a Japanese boy and an American soldier, once a prisoner in a nearby U.S. war camp. The story takes a dramatic turn when the young boy is rescued from drowning by the very prisoners he had initially feared. This heartwarming adaptation of Tetsuya Takeda's tale weaves a delicate thread of friendship and humanity amidst the backdrop of war.",
