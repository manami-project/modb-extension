To cover for her, she makes a deal with her roommate Hitch Dreyse - Annie must solve a missing person case involving Carly Stratmann, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. As Annie investigates, she uncovers a web of crime and corruption involving the illegal drug coderoin. Every clue seems to raise more questions about what Carly's father Elliot is hiding and where Carly has disappeared to. With time running out, Annie races to find answers before her absence is discovered. Meanwhile, Mikasa Ackerman reminisces about her childhood with Eren Yeager and the time she almost lost him. Gripped by worry for Eren, Mikasa begins to relive traumatic memories in an alternate version of the past where some things can be changed, but other events seem inescapably cruel. This three-part OVA adapts the Attack on Titan: Lost Girls spinoff novel, revealing untold stories about Mikasa and Annie's pasts while expanding on the complex mysteries of the world they inhabit.",
