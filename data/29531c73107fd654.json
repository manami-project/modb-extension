  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Timing tells the story of a failed Japanese-Korean horror film co-production that was intended for release in 2012, but was canceled due to issues securing Korean investors. All that remains of the project is a 6-minute promotional video. This video focuses on four characters with time-related abilities who strive to prevent tragedies at a high school. Though the full film was never completed, this promotional clip offers a glimpse into what could have been an imaginative and thrilling cross-cultural production. With elements of horror and human drama fueled by supernatural time manipulation, Timing seemed poised to provide a unique cinematic experience before its premature demise in development. Even in its fragmented state, fans of Asian horror cinema or stories about the consequences of distorting time may find the ambitious ideas contained in this little-known relic worth uncovering.",
