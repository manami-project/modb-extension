  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Timing, a Japanese-Korean horror anime, was intended for release in 2012, but was left unfinished due to undetermined Korean investors, resulting in only a six-minute promotional video being available. The plot revolves around four unique characters, each possessing time-related abilities, who join forces to prevent a series of tragic events unfolding within a high school. Despite its incomplete status, the captivating concept and intriguing characters make Timing a compelling and enticing watch.",
