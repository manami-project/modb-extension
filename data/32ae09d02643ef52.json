    "text": "Yuki, Yuzuru, and Kanoko form an unconventional household, where the two young men serve as housekeepers for the young girl, Kanoko. Despite their contrasting personalities – Yuzuru being kind-hearted and sophisticated, while Yuki is mischievous and somewhat immature – they strive to maintain harmony in their shared living space. However, their coexistence is put to the test when Kanoko's new pair of cherry-patterned panties mysteriously vanish, and Yuki is suspected of being the culprit. As trust and misunderstandings intertwine, will this trio be able to continue living together, or will the tension tear them apart? This engaging short film explores themes of camaraderie, trust, and the challenges of sharing a home.",
