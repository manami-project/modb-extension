  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After abandoning his family's traditional sweet shop in Kyoto to pursue his dreams, Nagomu Irino returns home 10 years later when he hears his father has been hospitalized. Expecting to take over the family business, Ryokushou, Nagomu is surprised to find a 10-year-old girl named Itsuka Yukihira has become the shop's poster child and presumed successor in his absence. Itsuka was abandoned at the shop by her father years ago and, with no other family, the Irinos took her in. Hoping to ease Itsuka's longing for her real father, Nagomu's mother asks him to act as a father figure. However, still bitter over Nagomu's earlier desertion, Itsuka openly despises him and is determined to one day run Ryokushou herself. Despite their poor start, Nagomu and Itsuka slowly bond over their shared love of the shop's sweets and their parallel family circumstances. As they overcome their differences, Nagomu steps into his role as Itsuka's foster father, and their newfound relationship begins sweetening the lives of those around them.",
