  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyoto-born Nagomu Irino, a once aspiring musician, returns home after a decade to find his family's traditional sweets shop, Ryokushou, under unexpected circumstances. His father, the shop owner, is hospitalized, and a young girl named Itsuka Yukihira has been working at the shop and is seen as the rightful heir. Nagomu's homecoming is met with resistance from Itsuka, who believes he has no right to claim the shop after abandoning his family to pursue his musical dreams. To add to the complexity, Nagomu's mother asks him to act as a father figure to Itsuka, hoping to alleviate her longing for her own absent father. As Nagomu and Itsuka navigate their shared love for Ryokushou and its confections, they discover unexpected similarities and form a bond that begins to sweeten their lives and those around them.",
