    "text": "Tatami Galaxy follows an unnamed third-year university student in Kyoto, Japan, who feels disillusioned with his college experience. He meets a self-proclaimed deity of matrimony at a mysterious ramen stand, which sends him hurtling through a series of flashbacks to his college days. During this time, he falls under the influence of a cruel new friend, Ozu, who turns him from a hopeless romantic into a mischievous \"black cupid.\" He becomes obsessed with breaking up couples on campus, which often conflicts with his feelings for a second-year engineering student, Akashi. As he relives his college years, he tries to make different decisions to find love and experience the \"Rose-Colored Campus Life\" he always dreamed of. Will he ever be satisfied with how his life turns out? This surreal and artistic anime is based on the author's experiences at Kyoto University.",
