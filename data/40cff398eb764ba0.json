    "text": "The Oorai girls return in this lighthearted collection of mini episodes that provide fun and humorous glimpses into their daily school life adventures. Over the summer break, the student council announces a fun beach trip, sending the girls into a shopping frenzy for new swimsuits. We also get to tour the Oorai school ship and see the hilarious talent contest between tankery teams. Interspersed are more tales from the girls' summer activities - from lively camping trips to learning traditional dances. Through it all, the Oorai crew brings their signature brand of passion and camaraderie, making even mundane tasks lively and entertaining. This easygoing anthology promises more of the playful spirit and bond of sisterhood that makes fans love the Oorai squad.",
