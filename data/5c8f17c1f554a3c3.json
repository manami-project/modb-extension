    "text": "After decades of war between humanity and the sinister Dark Ones, a stalemate has been reached. The legendary giant robot Atlanger, which has defended Earth for years, is about to be formally retired. However, just as Atlanger's last mission is announced, the planet comes under sudden attack from the Dark Ones. With little time to lose, a group of rookie pilots are called upon to take control of Atlanger and confront this new threat. Leading the ragtag team is the passionate yet inexperienced Asuka Ken. Despite the daunting task ahead, he is determined to master Atlanger's immense power and live up to the giant robot's legendary status. The stakes could not be higher - failure would mean the end of human civilization at the hands of the ruthless Dark Ones. All eyes turn to Asuka and his rookie crew as mankind's last hope to defeat the alien menace, save Earth, and usher in a new age of peace.",
