  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jyushimatsu, Todomatsu, Choromatsu, Ichimatsu, Karamatsu, and Osomatsu - the Matsuno sextuplets - are all grown up but have no intention of joining the workforce. In their parents' home in Japan, they spend their days lounging around, avoiding responsibilities, and reveling in their NEET status. Despite being in their twenties, the brothers have no motivation to find employment, and their unique personalities often lead to hilarious and bizarre situations.\n\nLiving in a world that has drastically changed since their grade-school days in the Sh≈çwa period, the Matsuno siblings must navigate modern society while still clinging to their carefree and mischievous ways. Their daily adventures include everything from attempting to pick up girlfriends to searching for the perfect job, all while trying to survive the challenges that come with being sextuplets.\n\nTheir eccentric neighbors, including fish market idol Totoko, troublemaker Iyami, and wacky inventor Dekapan, add to the chaos and fun of their daily lives. Whether they're figuring out who should pay the bar bill or deciding who gets the last pastry, the Matsuno brothers are never short on excitement. Join them as they overcome the mundane hurdles of their unconventional lives, always finding new ways to make the most of their time.",
