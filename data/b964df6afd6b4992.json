  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the provided synopses, this anime follows Nanami and her familiar Tomoe, who share a kiss early on that makes Nanami feel more secure in their relationship. However, Nanami's insecurities resurface when Tomoe receives a mysterious black box that he claims means he no longer needs her. Desperate to understand the significance of this box, Nanami tries to secretly uncover what it contains. In another storyline, after overhearing that she may be too spoiled by Tomoe, a determined Nanami sets out to demonstrate her independence during a trip with him to a hot spring hotel. There she learns of a special stone that purportedly grants eternal happiness to couples if they touch it together. However, Nanami insists on making the long trek to the stone without Tomoe's assistance in order to prove herself capable. Along the way, Nanami and Tomoe encounter previous acquaintances as they navigate the ups and downs of their complex relationship and Nanami's ongoing efforts to feel needed and secure. Their story unfolds over two OVA episodes bundled with the 16th volume of the manga, one being an adaptation and the other containing an original plotline.",
