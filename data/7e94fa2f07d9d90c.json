Inspired by the Brothers Grimm's Bremen Town Musicians, this anime follows the journey of four animals - Coda the cat, Allegro the dog, Largo the donkey, and Minuet the chicken. When they rescue Rondo, an alien on a peace mission, he gifts them a machine that transforms them into humans. As they navigate the town in their new forms, they witness the horrors of war and are compelled to fight against it, reminiscent of Tezuka Osamu's beloved 'The Amazing Three'. Prepare to be enthralled by this heartwarming tale of courage and unity as our heroes strive to protect Earth and restore peace.",
