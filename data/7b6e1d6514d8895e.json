    "text": "Pluto's ruler, Hades, is poised to engulf the world in darkness after 243 years of dormancy. His spirit has awakened within a pure human, and his 108 Spectres, along with the deceased Gold Saints, are ready to wage a Holy War to seize Athena's head. The goddess of war and wisdom, Athena, now reincarnated as Saori Kido, finds herself in grave danger. Seiya and the other Bronze Saints rise to the challenge, but their assistance is met with disdain by the surviving Gold Saints. As the Silver Saints fall prey to Hades' corruption, the remaining Gold Saints must rally to protect Saori. With Seiya and his friends joining the fray, the stage is set for a fierce battle to save Athena and thwart Hades' nefarious plans. Will they succeed in averting the impending doom? Witness the return of the legendary saints and their blazing cosmos in \"Saint Seiya: The Hades Chapter - Sanctuary\"!",
