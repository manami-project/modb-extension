    "text": "Just an ordinary girl, Chika Takami finds her world transformed after a trip to Tokyo, where she discovers the dazzling realm of school idols. Inspired by the once-renowned idol group μ's, Chika sets her sights on establishing her own idol club at her quiet seaside school, Uranohoshi Girls' High School. Despite her lack of club experience or exceptional talents, Chika's determination remains unshaken. However, her ambitious plans are met with resistance from the stern student council president, Dia Kurosawa.\n\nIn her quest for members, Chika encounters Riko Sakurauchi, a gifted yet introverted piano player who has recently transferred from the prestigious Otonokizaka High School—the birthplace of μ's. Chika sees Riko's potential and endeavors to persuade her to join the club. Despite the challenges that lie ahead, Chika's unwavering spirit propels her forward as she strives to form a school idol group that can rival the brilliance of the legendary μ's. Alongside her friends, Chika embarks on a journey to make their dreams a reality, proving that with perseverance and passion, even the most ordinary girls can shine.",
