  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Group, Cleopatra DC, wields immense power over the United States economy, nearly rivaling the government itself. At its helm is the stunning, intelligent, and courageous Ms. Cleo, a young prodigy of a chairman. Fortunately for her, she's well-equipped to handle unexpected expenses, like when an airplane crash-lands into her bedroom. But this is just the beginning of her misfortunes, as she grapples with stolen artifacts, corporate abductions, and clandestine cyborg projects spinning out of control.\n\nAs the formidable leader of Cleopatra Corns Group, Ms. Cleo's responsibilities often clash with her desire for leisure and exotic getaways. Yet, when global crises arise, she's quick to set aside her luxurious pursuits to lend a hand. These crises range from terrorist-induced oil well fires to averting a potential Armageddon triggered by a telepathic girl.\n\nDespite her youth and penchant for blonde moments, Cleo, along with her trusted friend and advisor, Swen, find themselves entangled in a web of intricate situations orchestrated by the shadowy economic entity, Sleider. From thwarting biological warfare to resolving kidnapping cases, there's never a dull moment in the lives of these two adventurous women striving for some peace and fun.",
