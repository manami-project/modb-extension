  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Romae Thermae follows the journey of Lucius Modestus, a Roman architect specializing in public bathhouses, who finds himself struggling with creative block and unemployment. In an attempt to help him relax, his friends take him to a bustling bathhouse. Unable to find solace amidst the noise, Lucius submerges his head in the water and discovers a hidden tunnel that transports him to a contemporary Japanese bathhouse.\n\nEnthralled by the modern designs and concepts, Lucius attempts to recreate these innovative ideas in ancient Rome, albeit with limited resources and technology. Despite the inferior quality of his replicas, his ingenuity captures the attention of the Roman citizens, offering him a chance to rebuild his reputation as an architect.\n\nThis comedic tale explores the unique bathing cultures of two civilizations—the ancient Romans and the modern Japanese—through the eyes of Lucius as he time-travels between them. Experience the blending of cultures, laughter, and architectural marvels in this three-episode series that redefines the art of bathing.",
