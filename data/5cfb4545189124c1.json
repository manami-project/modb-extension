    "text": "Chimera, a planet teeming with carnivorous plants and ruthless convicts, is the unwelcome new home for Thor and Rai, twin brothers who once lived a privileged life on the advanced space colony Juno. After witnessing the mysterious assassination of their parents, the twins are forcibly sent to this unforgiving world by unknown masked men.\n\nAs they navigate this harsh environment where only the strongest survive, the twins encounter Zagi, the leader of one of the four human tribes known as 'Rings'. The only hope of escaping Chimera lies in becoming the 'Beast King', the most powerful human who rules over the Rings.\n\nFor Thor, the path to survival is a cruel and brutal journey filled with unexpected revelations about Chimera and the fate of humanity. Meanwhile, Rai struggles to adapt to the harsh realities of their new home. Driven by the desire to uncover the truth behind their parents' murder and return home, Thor must rise above the lawless society, conquer the Rings, and claim the title of the Beast King.",
