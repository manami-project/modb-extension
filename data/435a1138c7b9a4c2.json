  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To escape the monotony of his mundane school life, Haneda Takashi harbors a clandestine desire to flee to an alternate universe. Yet, he finds himself tethered to his current reality by the affection he holds for two significant individuals: his socially awkward younger sister, Kobato, and his somewhat indifferent girlfriend, Watarai Asuka. Meanwhile, Chitose Shuusuke, a struggling freelancer, spends his days hopping from one part-time job to another. His life takes an unexpected turn when he crosses paths with the enigmatic Tamaizumi Hiyoko, who eventually becomes his coworker. Narita Hayato, a self-proclaimed tough guy, finds solace in the company of night owls and misfits, shunning conventional social interactions. His life intertwines with the cheerful and seemingly oblivious Otori Naru during one of his nocturnal escapades. As these three young men navigate their complex relationships with these women, the nature of their connection to each other remains a mystery. Set against the backdrop of a bustling city teeming with life and opportunities, this anime explores the intricate web of relationships that blossom amidst the urban chaos.",
