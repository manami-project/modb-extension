    "text": "Tokyo MX's latest anime, \"Backwasher! Her and I, in the Womenâ€™s Bath!?\", brings a unique twist to the world of public bathhouses. Souta, a high school student, unexpectedly inherits the traditional role of a 'Sansuke' from his grandfather, a job that involves washing and massaging customers. Initially, he believes his clientele will consist of elderly women, but his world turns upside down when his school's volleyball team, including his secret admirer and childhood friend Aoi Yuzuki, and the school's idol Mei Sasakura, pay a visit. Unbeknownst to Aoi, it's Souta who's providing the massage, leading to a shift in their relationship dynamics. As Souta navigates this unexpected turn of events, he finds himself in a hot water comedy of errors, filled with love, laughter, and the challenges of maintaining tradition in a modern world. The anime is based on Toyo's manga \"Asoko Araiya-san!\" and is available in both censored and uncut versions, with the latter containing explicit content.",
