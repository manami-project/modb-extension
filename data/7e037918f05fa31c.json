  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Souta takes over the traditional job of \"Sansuke\" (bathhouse body washer) from his grandfather at the family-owned public bath. Unbeknownst to Souta, the girls from his high school volleyball team, including his childhood friend Aoi, visit the bath and request massages. Souta begins massaging Aoi without realizing her identity at first. As he continues massaging her during repeated visits, their relationship grows increasingly intimate. This comedic anime explores the awkwardness and evolving romance between Souta and Aoi, brought together by his unexpected part-time job as a traditional bathhouse masseuse. Their interactions play out behind the curtain of the women's bath, culminating in explicit scenes as emotions and passions heighten. Centered around humor and steamy moments, Backwasher! is likely to entertain viewers looking for an ecchi romantic comedy. Souta's trials and tribulations as Sansuke also offer an amusing window into little-known Japanese bathhouse traditions.",
