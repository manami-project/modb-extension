  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Zannen 5, also known as Team Rabbits, is a group of genetically engineered children who are tasked with defending humanity from an alien invasion in the year 2110. As Earth expands its reach into space and secures asteroids rich in natural resources, a mysterious galactic empire called Urgal, also known as Urugaru, invades from Jupiter, threatening mankind's existence. In response, the secret military agency MJP creates humans who can adapt to life in space and pilots special mecha called \"Ash\" to combat the threat.\n\nIzuru, Toshikazu, Tamaki, Kei, and Ataru make up the Zannen 5, a team known for their poor grades and clumsy maneuvers. Despite their reputation, they are called upon by the Global Defense Force to pilot the special mecha and protect humanity. Enrolled in the academy city of Gurantseere, the team learns to work together and overcome their shortcomings to become the heroes Earth needs. Can the Zannen 5 rise to the challenge and defend humanity against the Urgal invasion? Only time will tell.",
