    "text": "In the year 2110, humanity has expanded into space to secure resources for the future. However, Earth is invaded by the mysterious Urgal empire from Jupiter. To defend humanity, a secret military agency undertakes the MJP gene manipulation project, creating children with abilities to adapt to space - Team Rabbits. These children, including the protagonist Izuru, are given combat mecha called 'Ash' and sent to the frontlines to shield the Global Defense Force. Izuru enrolls in the academy city Gurantseere to learn to pilot the mecha. Though nicknamed the \"Failure 5\" for their poor grades, Izuru is tasked with leading Team Rabbits against the alien invasion force known as Urugaru. Despite the impossible odds, the series follows whether Izuru and his inept but earnest team can rise to the challenge and protect the human race.",
