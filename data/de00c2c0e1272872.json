  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After meeting normal high school girl Katou Megumi one spring day, geeky student Aki Tomoya becomes determined to turn her into the heroine of his visual novel game. He recruits his talented friends to form the development team Blessing Software, including illustrator Eriri Spencer Sawamura, writer Utaha Kasumigaoka, and programmer Michiru Hyoudou. The team manages to complete the first route of Tomoya's game, but with the Winter Comiket event only two months away, they face a race against time to finish the full game. Megumi also proves a challenge, as she lacks presence and personality to be Tomoya's ideal lead heroine. As they work furiously towards the deadline, Blessing Software struggles with the realities of professional game development - tough deadlines, constant edits and revisions, and interpersonal conflicts. Through determination and teamwork, they aim to create the best visual novel of the season, but many obstacles remain on the road ahead.",
