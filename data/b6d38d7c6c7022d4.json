    "text": "Amagi Brilliant Park is an amusement park staffed by eccentric employees, led by manager Kanie. Things are always hectic as mishaps arise and staff have to cover for each other. One day, while Kanie is trying to get work done, there is an incident that requires him to shuffle employees around. At the same time, the mascot Moffle takes three new recruits - Eiko, Biino and Shiina - on a public relations training mission. On another occasion, the staff plans a surprise birthday party for Kanie's secretary Isuzu. Moffle and Isuzu make the preparations, but the daily chaos makes it difficult. Due to mix-ups, some staff switch roles for the day, leading to humorous results. Meanwhile, Moffle's outing with the rookie trio has unexpected outcomes. Despite all the craziness, the team pulls together to try and make the party and gift-giving a success. Working at Amagi Brilliant Park means constantly facing unpredictable situations. But the quirky staff members step up to take on new roles when duty calls. Though things don't always go smoothly, their camaraderie and determination help them handle each zany challenge.",
