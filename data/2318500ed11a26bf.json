    "text": "Cthulhu deity Nyaruko, capable of assuming any form, chooses to appear as an ordinary silver-haired girl, finds herself entangled in the life of Mahiro Yasaka, a typical high school student. One fateful night, Mahiro is pursued by extraterrestrial beings, only to be rescued by Nyaruko. As the end of human life on Earth looms closer, the pair continues their daily routine, with Nyaruko persistently attempting to win Mahiro's affections. Meanwhile, their household expands with the arrival of additional Outer Gods, including the flirtatious Cthuko, the shameless pervert Atsuko, and the timid, bespectacled Nyarle. Mahiro's life is set to become increasingly chaotic as he navigates this new reality.",
