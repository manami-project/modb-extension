    "text": "Tuesday and Carole, two aspiring musicians from different walks of life, find themselves on Mars, fifty years after humanity began colonizing the red planet. In a world where AI dominates cultural production and people are content as passive consumers, these two young women yearn for something more.\n\nCarole, a determined and resourceful resident of the bustling Alba City, works part-time jobs to support her dream of becoming a musician. Despite the city's vibrant atmosphere, she can't shake the feeling that something is missing from her life. Meanwhile, Tuesday, a privileged girl from the quaint Herschel City, longs for a deeper connection with the world around her. Misunderstood by her affluent family and peers, she feels isolated and alone in her pursuit of music.\n\nA chance encounter brings these two souls together, and they discover a shared passion for creating music. As they embark on their musical journey, they find solace and strength in each other, believing that together, they can make a difference. Even if their impact starts as just a small wave, they trust that it will eventually grow into something much larger, challenging the status quo and inspiring others to embrace their creativity.",
