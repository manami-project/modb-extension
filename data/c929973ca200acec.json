  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This lighthearted anime centers around mascot characters that live alongside humans in everyday life. Specialized agencies train these mascots to care for and babysit children before placing them with adoptive families. The story follows Noramimi, a well-intentioned yet hapless mascot residing at the Hello Kids agency. Hailing from a demon lineage, Noramimi yearns to be adopted but remains overlooked by prospective families. As he continues his quest to find a home, amusing misadventures with both humans and mascots ensue. Though the odds seem stacked against him, Noramimi's kind spirit and comedic hijinks suggest his time will come to finally feel the warmth of family.",
