    "text": "Later that summer, under a sky ablaze with stars, Kozue embarks on a journey in pursuit of meteorites. Instead, she encounters Ginga, a boy clad in a spacesuit, who possesses an uncanny ability to unravel the mysteries of distant celestial bodies. Held captive by scientists who exploit his powers, Ginga's life is dictated by the confines of his protective suit. As Kozue and Ginga bond over their shared love for astronomy, Kozue becomes determined to liberate Ginga from his constraints and help him reclaim control over his own life. In the vast expanse of the cosmos, a tale of friendship, love, and self-discovery unfolds, as two kindred spirits challenge the boundaries that bind them.",
