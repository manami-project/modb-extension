    "text": "Kozue is a high school girl and member of the astronomy club who loves stargazing. During summer vacation, she goes on a trip to the countryside, hoping to see a meteor shower. Instead, she meets Ginga, a mysterious boy wearing a spacesuit. Ginga has the unique ability to intuitively understand detailed information about distant stars. Due to this special power, he has been held captive by scientists and forced to help them against his will. He longs to make his own choices but feels trapped by his circumstances. When Kozue learns of Ginga's situation, she is compelled to help him. As she spends more time with Ginga, gazing at the stars and listening to him share his dreams, she develops feelings for him. Kozue decides she must find a way to convince Ginga to remove his spacesuit and embrace his freedom. This is the poignant story of two young people brought together by their shared love of astronomy. Through their deepening bond, Kozue may be the key to helping Ginga reclaim control of his future. Under the starlit skies, they discover hope, friendship and new beginnings.",
