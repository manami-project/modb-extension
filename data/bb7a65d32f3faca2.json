  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Christianity's Messiah and Buddhism's Enlightened One, Jesus and Buddha, have traded the celestial realms for a cozy apartment in Tokyo, Japan, as they embark on a well-deserved vacation in the modern world. As roommates, they explore the wonders of contemporary life, from the thrills of amusement parks and the excitement of flash sales, to the simple joys of seasonal changes and local festivals.\n\nWhile attempting to blend in and maintain their anonymity, they encounter a myriad of challenges and quirky situations, including Jesus being mistaken for a yakuza boss's son and Buddha becoming the target of petty bullies. Despite their divine status, they strive to navigate the complexities of modern Japanese society while keeping their true identities under wraps.\n\nSaint Young Men is a delightful and humorous tale that offers a glimpse into the daily lives of these two revered figures as they experience the ups and downs of life on Earth, proving that even the holiest of beings can find joy and amusement in the mundane.",
