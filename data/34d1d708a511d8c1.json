    "text": "Tamako Love Story follows a group of high school friends in a mochi shop district as they reach graduation and confront changes in their relationships and futures. Central characters Tamako and Mochizou have grown up together but have an unspoken fondness they haven't acted upon. As their friends make plans to leave for university or jobs elsewhere, Mochizou hopes to confess his feelings to Tamako before moving away to college, worried that not speaking up will mean losing her from his life. Though Tamako is sad to see her friends follow their dreams and move on, she plans to stay and work in her family’s generational mochi shop. But she is unaware of Mochizou's affections and her own feelings for him. Their subtle romance provides an emotional core to the story as the clock ticks down to separation. This anime film continues the warm community life established in the Tamako Market series while focusing on Tamako and Mochizou’s flowering youthful love against the bittersweet backdrop of impending change. As the young adults contemplate and shape their futures, many heartfelt goodbyes, confessions, and beginnings fill their final high school days together.",
