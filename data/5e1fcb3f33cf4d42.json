  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Five years after winning the martial arts tournament, Gokuu is living peacefully with his wife and young son, Gohan. This changes with the arrival of Raditz, who reveals he is Gokuu's long-lost brother and that Gokuu is actually a Saiyan warrior sent to Earth as a baby to destroy the planet. However, Gokuu lost his memory and violent nature after a head injury, instead growing up kind and protective of others. Raditz tries unsuccessfully to recruit Gokuu to join him. He then warns Gokuu's friends that more Saiyans are coming to Earth, seeking the mystical Dragon Balls that can grant wishes. This sparks an intergalactic conflict, with Gokuu and his allies defending the planet against enemies like the tyrant Frieza and threats from the android Cell and the monster Buu. Throughout these battles, Gokuu discovers more about his Saiyan origins and unlocks tremendous power, at times being the only one capable of protecting Earth. He raises a family and gains new allies even as enemies also sometimes become friends. Ultimately, although faced with dangerous foes, Gokuu is ready to train hard and fight to save his adopted homeworld.",
