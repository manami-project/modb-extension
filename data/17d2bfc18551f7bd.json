  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On April Fool's Day, 2011, Nitroplus unveiled a parody opening for a fictional spin-off of the popular anime series Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica, entitled Mahou Shoujo Sonico Magika. The parody features characters from Nitroplus's upcoming visual novel game, SoniComi. To further the prank, Nitroplus launched an official website announcing the spin-off as a full-fledged TV series, complete with a screenplay credit to Urobuchi Gen, a Nitroplus staffer known for his work on Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica. However, no actual screenplay was ever penned for this parody anime, making the opening video the extent of the joke. Fans of both Mahou Shoujo Madoka Magica and SoniComi will enjoy this humorous mash-up, which serves as a light-hearted tribute to both franchises.",
