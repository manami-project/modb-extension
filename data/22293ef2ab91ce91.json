  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Summer Pockets follows Hairi Takahara, a young man who travels to the rural island of Torishirojima to handle the estate of his recently deceased grandmother. Still haunted by an unpleasant past incident, Hairi hopes the tranquil island will provide respite from his trauma. Upon arriving, Hairi encounters a mysterious girl alone on the pier, serenely gazing out across the sea as the wind billows her hair. When he looks again, she has vanished. As Hairi adjusts to the leisurely pace of island life, surrounded by lush nature unlike anything in the city, he is flooded with nostalgic memories long forgotten. Over the course of his stay, Hairi befriends four girls—Shiroha, Ao, Kamome, and Tsumugi—each with their own reasons for being on the island that summer. Whether pursuing local legends, searching for pirate treasure, or simply finding oneself, the four help Hairi confront his past and make new memories to last a lifetime. Through days spent connecting with these girls and Torishirojima's quaint charms, Hairi begins to heal in this peaceful, rural paradise by the sea.",
