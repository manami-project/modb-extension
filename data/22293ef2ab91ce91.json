    "text": "Takahara Hairi, a city-dweller, finds himself on the tranquil island of Torishirojima, nestled in the heart of the Seto Inland Sea, following an unfortunate event and the passing of his grandmother. With a population of just 2,000, this idyllic island becomes his temporary home as he takes on the responsibility of managing his grandmother's estate.\n\nUpon his arrival, Hairi is captivated by the sight of a solitary girl standing on the pier, her hair dancing in the wind. However, she vanishes as suddenly as she appeared, leaving Hairi in a state of wonder. As he adjusts to the island's lush surroundings and relaxed pace, memories of a forgotten past begin to resurface.\n\nThroughout his stay, Hairi encounters four unique girls who become the center of his island experience. There's Shiroha Naruse, a girl who seems to have misplaced her summer vacation; Ao Sorakado, a determined legend hunter; Kamome Kushima, a sophisticated young lady on a quest for a pirate ship; and Tsumugi Wenders, a young soul in search of her true self.\n\nAs Hairi navigates through his summer on Torishirojima, he finds himself entwined in a web of nostalgia, mystery, and self-discovery. This heartwarming tale of friendship and adventure promises to leave a lasting impression.",
