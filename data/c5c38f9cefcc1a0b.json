    "text": "Gurazeni: Money Pitch follows the story of Natsunosuke Honda, a talented relief pitcher playing for the professional baseball team called the Jingu Spiders. In this highly competitive environment, a player's salary directly corresponds to their on-field performance and value to the team. After missing four months due to injury, Natsunosuke is eager to regain his top form during the last 23 games of the season. With the Jingu Spiders only one game behind the division-leading Osaka Tempters and Bunkyo Mops, Natsunosuke sees a chance to propel his team to victory in the close pennant race. His strong return could prove pivotal in determining whether the Spiders capture the division title. Driven by both team success and personal ambition, Natsunosuke constantly seeks out new pitching challenges to showcase his talents. Facing elite hitters allows him to benchmark his abilities and further cement his reputation as one of the highest-paid players. With nonstop competitive drive, Natsunosuke pursues continuous self-improvement on the mound as he aims to solidify his place at the pinnacle of this performance-based team hierarchy.",
