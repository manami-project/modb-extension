  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ten years after the March sisters lived together in Newcord, Jo March has married Professor Friedrich Bhaer and founded a school called Plumfield on their farm. Here they take in orphaned and troubled children, committed to providing them a nurturing home. The peaceful school is stirred up when they enroll the strong-willed Nan Harding, whose rebellious spirit challenged her previous tutor. Though Nan struggles to adjust and causes some mischief, Jo sees past her prickly exterior to the creative girl within. Nan befriends imaginative Stuffy, talented violinist Nat, kind Demi and other children, each with their own stories. Tommy arrives as Nan's rival before they build a friendship. Together the children experience the adventures, laughter and growing pains of childhood on the farm. Despite mistakes made, Jo continues encouraging them to develop into their best selves. Through living at Plumfield school, this ragtag group of orphans forms life-long bonds under the patient guidance of Jo and Fritz, discovering what it means to have a home.",
