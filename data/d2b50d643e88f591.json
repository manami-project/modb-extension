  "synopsis": {
    "text": "All his life, the towering and muscular Takeo Gouda has been the epitome of chivalry and bravery, earning him admiration from his male peers. However, his imposing appearance and lack of conventional good looks have consistently put him in the friend zone, with girls invariably falling for his attractive best friend, Makoto Sunakawa. Resigned to his fate, Takeo's life takes an unexpected turn when he rescues the sweet and innocent Rinko Yamato from a harasser on a train. As love blossoms in his heart for Yamato, he struggles with the belief that she, like all others, might be drawn to Sunakawa instead. Determined to put her happiness first, Takeo selflessly takes on the role of a cupid, all the while hoping for a love story of his own.",
