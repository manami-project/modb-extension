  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's been the new girl more times than she can count, and as a result, Mikiko Amane has developed a cool and aloof demeanor to cope with her transient lifestyle. Making friends or forming deep connections has become a distant concept for this elementary school student, as she knows her time in any one place is always limited. But when she finds herself in a new school once again, she encounters a boy whose face bears an uncanny resemblance to that of a cat. This peculiar discovery sparks an interest in Mikiko that she can't seem to shake off, and she can't help but be drawn to the enigmatic feline-faced boy. Based on the popular manga, this anime adaptation offers a delightful tale of curiosity, connection, and the unexpected places where friendships can bloom.",
