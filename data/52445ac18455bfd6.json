  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nodame Cantabile is an anime about the relationship between Shinichi Chiaki, an arrogant yet talented pianist, and Megumi \"Nodame\" Noda, a quirky pianist who proclaims herself to be Chiaki's girlfriend. The story follows Chiaki and Nodame as they attend a prestigious music academy in Japan. Though they get off to a rocky start, with Chiaki looking down on Nodame's eccentric personality and unrefined piano skills, over time a romance seems to blossom between them. In one episode, after an argument over soy sauce during dinner, Nodame impulsively agrees to go on a date with Lucas, a young French piano prodigy, in order to make Chiaki jealous. Though her plan backfires at first, Nodame is relieved when she sees a familiar face clinging to Chiaki's arm. This sparks true feelings of jealousy within Chiaki for the first time. As the anime progresses, Chiaki and Nodame continue navigating their way through music school while also figuring out their complex relationship. Their quirky dynamic and passion for music leads them through humorous hijinks and personal growth.",
