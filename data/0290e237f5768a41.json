  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hibiki Higoromo, an amnesiac girl known as \"Empty,\" wakes up in a strange, neighboring world. There, she encounters Kurumi Tokisaki, a mysterious girl who leads her to a school to participate in a battle royale death match against other quasi-spirits. These quasi-spirits each possess unique abilities and fight for the chance to have a single wish granted. Bound by the rules of this lethal game, Empty and Kurumi form a cautious alliance amidst the looming threat of the other spirit combatants. Though details remain scarce, it is clear that Empty and Kurumi find themselves embroiled in a high-stakes competition set in an alternate realm. As quasi-spirits ready their powers, the school becomes an arena in which these girls must fight to the death if they hope to have their greatest desires fulfilled.",
