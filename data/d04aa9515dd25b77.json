  "synopsis": {
    "text": "April 8, 2013 marked the beginning of a new era for NTV's ZIP! television program with the introduction of Mazinger ZIP!, a series of animated flash-shorts. This fresh addition replaced the previous anime parody short, Ohayou Ninja-tai Gatchaman, based on Science Ninja Team Gatchaman.\n\nMazinger ZIP! brings back the beloved characters from the original Mazinger Z series, placing them in a series of humorous, bite-sized sketches. The comedy is contemporary, often drawing on elements of modern Japanese society for its laughs.\n\nIn a delightful twist, some episodes even feature guest appearances from the Gatchaman team, adding an extra layer of excitement for fans of the original series. So, get ready to start your day with a hearty laugh as you tune in to Mazinger ZIP! a few minutes before 7:00 am.",
