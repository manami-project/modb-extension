  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She left two years ago, but her specter still lingers. In the year 2034, the elite anti-terrorist unit Section 9 finds itself under new leadership, with Togusa now at the helm. As the team grapples with a series of complex incidents, a sinister figure emerges from the shadows: the Puppeteer, a hacker of unparalleled skill.\n\nAs Section 9 delves deeper into the case, they cross paths with their former commander, Major Motoko Kusanagi. But her cryptic warning to Batou - \"Stay away from the Solid State Society\" - only raises more questions. Is she somehow connected to the Puppeteer? Can Section 9 trust their former leader, or is she playing a dangerous game of her own?\n\nAs the investigation unfolds, the threads of the case weave together in an almost artistic tapestry of intrigue. Who is the Puppeteer, and what is their endgame? What will become of Batou's relationship with Motoko? And what secrets lie at the heart of the Solid State Society? Only time will tell, as Section 9 races against the clock to unravel the mystery before it's too late.",
