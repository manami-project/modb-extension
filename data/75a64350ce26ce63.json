  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They woke up in a world that was far from normal, a world where the rules of reality were twisted and distorted. The characters from the legendary works of mangaka Gou Nagai, including the iconic \"Devilman\", the mighty \"Mazinger Z\", and the ruthless \"Violence Jack\", found themselves trapped in a chaotic parody universe. In this bizarre realm, they were transformed into super-deformed versions of themselves, adding an extra layer of absurdity to their dire situation.\n\nAs they navigated through this mishmash of worlds, the characters were forced to engage in battles against each other, their friendships and alliances tested in the heat of combat. Amidst the chaos, they shared a common goal: to find a way back to their own world and restore their original forms.\n\nJoin Devilman, Miki, Ryo, and a talking turtle head on an extraordinary journey across diverse landscapes, from the frosty demon-infested lands to the towering robot-filled fortress of Mazinger Z and Dr. Hell, and the desolate plains ruled by Violence Jack. Will they be able to unravel the mystery behind their predicament and return to their own world? Only time will tell. Brace yourself for an action-packed, laugh-filled adventure that blends the best of Gou Nagai's creations in a way you've never seen before!",
