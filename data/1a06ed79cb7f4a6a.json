  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sato Moe, a young woman with a penchant for drink, stumbles upon an unusual find one evening: a round, cushion-like creature that turns out to be a stray cat. She affectionately names him Poyo, inspired by his unique shape, and welcomes him into her family. The Sato family, consisting of Moe, her high school-attending brother Hide, and her farmer father Shigeru, quickly grows fond of the enigmatic, fast, high-jumping, and adorable Poyo. Despite initial reluctance from Hide, who often finds himself inconvenienced by the cat's antics, Poyo's charming personality soon makes him an indispensable part of the family. The daily adventures of the Sato family revolve around Poyo, who enjoys baths and interacting with other neighborhood cats like Kurobe, while also displaying a caring side by sharing snacks with other strays. The heartwarming tale of \"Poyopoyo\" follows the delightful escapades of this extraordinary cat and his endearing human family.",
