    "text": "On December 24th, the idol group 22/7 makes a long-awaited comeback performance for their dedicated fans. This date marks the anniversary of the group's formation. The next day, the eight members convene at their agency office, only to discover the mysterious Wall has inexplicably reappeared in perfect condition. As the group grapples with this deepening enigma, member Sakura proposes holding a Christmas party to celebrate 22/7's reunion and boost morale. However, the festivities are interrupted by the arrival of three strangers wearing the same uniforms as the existing members. They introduce themselves as Mikami Kamiki, Yuki Toujou, and Tsubomi Hiiragi and claim the Wall has gathered them all together as new additions to the idol unit 22/7.",
