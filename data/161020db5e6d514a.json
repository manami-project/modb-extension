    "text": "Yaka, vending machines, and an unyielding fascination for the sky - this is the world of Yorito Morimiya, a high school student with an unusual hobby. His love for photographing the sky's ever-changing canvas leads him to an early morning encounter with a peculiar girl named Matsuri Shihou, who shares his passion for the heavens. However, Matsuri is no ordinary girl; she's an immortal Yaka, a creature of the night who shuns sunlight. As Yorito gets entangled in Matsuri's supernatural existence, he also grapples with the secrets surrounding his hospitalized sister, Aono, and their childhood friends, Mana and Koyori Ishizuki. In this world where the mundane meets the magical, Yorito must navigate the complexities of love, loneliness, and the relentless pursuit of a mysterious man who covets Matsuri's powers. Will Yorito's sky continue to be a sanctuary, or will it become a battleground? Only time will tell in the captivating tale of Sola.",
