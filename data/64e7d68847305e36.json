    "text": "When a lackadaisical freshman at Tanenashi High School is compelled to join a club, he stumbles upon an unconventional magic club led by the enchanting yet peculiar Tejina Senpai. With a debilitating case of stage fright, Tejina's magic tricks often result in comedic failures. Despite her ineptitude, the freshman finds himself captivated by Tejina's quirky charm and becomes an unwitting member of her club. As her assistant, he's thrust into a world of embarrassing mishaps and botched illusions, but perhaps together, they can create a little magic after all. Prepare for a delightful and eccentric journey filled with laughter and the occasional successful trick in this magical gag anime.",
