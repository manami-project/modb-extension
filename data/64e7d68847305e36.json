  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tanenashi High School has a rule requiring all students to join a club. An unmotivated freshman just wants to join a club that requires little effort on his part. During his lackadaisical search, he stumbles upon the magic club, which has only one member: an awkward but endearing upperclassman named Tejina. Tejina loves magic, but suffers from intense stage fright that causes her to mess up all of her tricks. Now that she suddenly has an audience of one, her attempts at magic become comedic displays of embarrassment. Nevertheless, the freshman finds himself drawn to the club, becoming Tejina's assistant. Together, they experience one hilariously failed magic trick after another. Tejina may never succeed at magic, but the freshman is no longer bored - he's unexpectedly enjoying his eccentric senpai's antics. Though she's weird, Tejina is also cute and charming in her own way. Her passion for magic against all odds is admirable, even if her failure rate remains at 100%.",
