  "synopsis": {
    "text": "I'll whisk you away to a not-so-distant future, where the tides have turned against humanity, leaving our once-thriving civilizations submerged beneath the ocean's surface. Amidst this watery world, we find Ikaruga Natsuki, a young man who has already weathered his share of storms. After losing his mother and his leg in a tragic accident, he returns to his rural childhood home, only to find the sea has claimed half of it.\n\nWith no family to lean on, Natsuki clings to his oceanologist grandmother's legacy: a ship, a submarine, and a mountain of debt. When a dubious debt collector named Catherine offers him a lifeline, he seizes it, embarking on a quest to uncover the sunken riches of his grandmother's underwater laboratory.\n\nHowever, the treasure they discover is far from ordinary. Instead of glittering jewels, they find Atri, a remarkable robot girl nestled within a coffin at the ocean floor. With her strikingly human appearance and rich emotional depth, Atri vows to fulfill her late master's last wish and, in the meantime, serve as Natsuki's leg.\n\nAs the ocean's embrace tightens around their small town, an extraordinary summer unfolds for Natsuki and his enigmatic robotic companion. Join them on this heartwarming adventure that explores the depths of friendship, resilience, and what it truly means to be human.",
