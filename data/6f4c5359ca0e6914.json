    "text": "Three ordinary Tokyo junior high students, Hikaru Shidou, Umi Ryuuzaki, and Fuu Hououji find themselves transported to the magical world of Cephiro during a school trip. There, they learn from Master Mage Clef that Cephiro's Pillar, Princess Emeraude, has been kidnapped by the High Priest Zagato. Without Emeraude's prayers to keep Cephiro in balance, the world is falling into ruin. As foretold in legend, the three girls have been summoned as the Magic Knights to save Cephiro. Though reluctant heroes, they accept magical powers from Clef to find the ancient Rune Gods and defeat Zagato. During their quest they face many foes sent by Zagato to thwart them. However, the girls also discover the power of friendship and loyalty in overcoming adversity. Through perseverance and teamwork, the Magic Knights ultimately confront Zagato, aiming to rescue Princess Emeraude and restore stability to Cephiro. Yet they find the truth behind Zagato's actions is more complex than expected. To save Cephiro, the girls must make an immense sacrifice. Their fantastical journey teaches them much about courage, love and destiny.",
