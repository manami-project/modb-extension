  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the quiet, isolated village of Sotoba, the arrival of a mysterious family coincides with a sudden outbreak of bizarre deaths. As the death toll rises rapidly, Sotoba's lone doctor Toshio Ozaki races to determine the cause while skeptical teenager Natsuno Yuuki investigates the new family next door. They soon discover the horrific truth - the dead are rising with an insatiable thirst for human blood. With escalating paranoia gripping the village, the hunters quickly become the hunted. Toshio and Natsuno reluctantly join forces with young siblings Akira and Kaori in a battle for survival against the vampire \"Shiki.\" Both sides are driven by the primitive urge to kill or be killed. Yet, each also harbors humanity within. As the life and death struggle consumes the town, the shades of gray between man and monster slowly fade to black. Adapted from the acclaimed horror novel by Fuyumi Ono, Shiki explores the fragile boundary between monster and victim. When basic survival is at stake and fear reigns supreme, who can still claim to be human? And who is truly divine? Abandoned by God and lost in a labyrinth of blood and violence, both mortal and immortal alike stand at the edge of darkness in this modern gothic nightmare.",
