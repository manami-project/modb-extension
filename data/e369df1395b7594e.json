    "text": "To celebrate the release of the second volume of a BL manga, a short anime introduces us to Kotone Aizuhara, a passionate fudanshi. While purchasing BL manga, Kotone's life takes a tragic turn as he is struck and killed by a truck. However, death is not the end for Kotone, as he awakens in a grand, ancient palace in an alternate world. Here, he encounters Nagi, a divine serpent-man, who reveals that Kotone is now his Miko. In order for Nagi to ascend to his higher dragon form, they must engage in an intimate act. Utilizing his extensive knowledge of BL, Kotone vows to prevent himself from falling in love and becoming the \"bottom\" in this fantastical Isekai world.",
