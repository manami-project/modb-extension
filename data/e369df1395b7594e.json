  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kotone is an avid reader of BL manga who tragically dies after being hit by a truck while purchasing his favorite reads. He awakens in a fantastical new world and comes face-to-face with Nagi, a powerful serpent deity in human form. Nagi reveals that Kotone is now destined to be his shrine maiden, and they must consummate their bond in order for Nagi to fully transform into a mighty dragon. Though initially shocked, Kotone draws on his extensive knowledge of BL tropes to navigate this precarious situation. He aims to subtly resist being relegated to the submissive \"bottom\" role and avoid falling in love - no easy task when dealing with a formidable and alluring god. What follows is a humorous yet poignant tale of a die-hard fan navigating uncharted romantic territory with a beguiling immortal beast. Will Kotone uphold his carefree fudanshi ideals? Or will he surrender to Nagi's forceful seduction and discover new horizons beyond the pages of fantasy? Their curious relationship sets the stage for a titillating clash where anything can happen in this tantalizing world.",
