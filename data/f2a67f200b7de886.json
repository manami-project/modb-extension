    "text": "On an isolated tropical island, a massive typhoon approaches as students prepare for their school's upcoming cultural festival. Shuuichi Azuma, a baseball player, shockingly quits the team despite his lifelong passion for the sport. This causes a bitter falling out with his best friend and teammate, Kenta Saijō. As the storm gathers strength, wreaking havoc across the island, Shuuichi and Kenta have an unexpected encounter with a strange, red-eyed girl named Noruda. Her sudden appearance is as mysterious as the typhoon itself. When lightning strikes the school's electrical tower, Noruda falls and is imperiled. Shuuichi races to rescue her as hurricane winds and rain batter the school. Despite their recent conflicts, Shuuichi, Kenta, and their classmates must find a way to work together amidst the catastrophic storm. Noruda may hold secrets about the typhoon’s origins and the fate of their island. More than their own survival is at stake - the lives of everyone they know are in jeopardy unless the students can uncover Noruda's secrets and find a way to weather this devastating storm.",
