  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unable to recall his past life, Otonashi finds himself in a mysterious realm that exists between life and death, taking the form of a school. Greeted by a girl named Yuri, who carries a firearm and leads an underground organization known as the Shinda Sekai Sensen (SSS), Otonashi is introduced to a world where \"dead\" adolescents defy the school system to avoid disappearing. In this afterlife, the SSS members engage in a relentless battle against Tenshi, the student council president with supernatural abilities, who aims to enforce order. As Otonashi joins the SSS, he struggles to regain his memories and navigate the complexities of this new world, all while being inexplicably drawn to Tenshi, who seems more human than angelic. In this war for their fates, Otonashi and his newfound allies challenge the system and their enigmatic enemy, seeking answers about their existence and the true nature of the afterlife.",
