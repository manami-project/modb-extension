  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From a young age, Tsukimi Kurashita has been captivated by the mesmerizing beauty of jellyfish, likening their delicate tentacles to a princess's flowing gown. To pursue her dream of becoming an illustrator, she relocates to Tokyo and finds solace in Amamizukan, an all-female apartment complex that houses an eclectic group of fujoshi with their own quirky passions. Sharing Tsukimi's aversion to social interactions and men, the group leads a peaceful yet uneventful life.\n\nTheir tranquility is disrupted when Tsukimi encounters a stunningly fashionable individual during a late-night jellyfish rescue mission. Inviting this enigmatic figure to stay at Amamizukan, Tsukimi and her friends are shocked to discover that their new guest is not the \"Stylish Girl\" they presumed, but rather a man named Kuranosuke Koibuchi.\n\nDespite his trendy appearance and seemingly shallow demeanor, Kuranosuke harbors secrets of his own. As he continues to visit the apartment complex, the once introverted and socially anxious wallflowers find their lives turned upside down. Will Tsukimi and her friends embrace this unexpected change, or will they cling to their former isolated existence?",
