  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Watch the enchanting adventures of Afro-Ken, a cheerful and innocent Japanese canine character created by San-X, the company behind other anime-style characters like Kogepan. Afro-Ken is easily recognizable by his vibrant, rainbow-colored afro that can take on various shapes and forms. This lovable dog is always in high spirits, eager to explore new experiences, and has a peculiar attraction to objects that resemble him, causing his hair to transform as he approaches them.\n\nJoin Afro-Ken and his extraordinary family tree of similarly named dog characters, including Techno-Ken, Funky-Ken, Lord-Ken, and Super Afro-Ken. Each family member shares Afro-Ken's kind-hearted nature and unique barking language. The only exception is Normal-Ken, who stands out with his less extravagant hair.\n\nIn 2001, Bandai Visual and Sunrise brought Afro-Ken's whimsical world to life in a 3DCG OVA adaptation, which aired globally on the anime satellite television network Animax. Follow Afro-Ken as he embarks on a series of delightful escapades that will leave you captivated and craving more.",
