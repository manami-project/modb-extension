    "text": "The cheerful and optimistic Hana Nono, a new student in town, aspires to shed her childish demeanor and embrace maturity. Her first day at school doesn't go as planned, but things take a dramatic turn when a mysterious baby, Hug-tan, and a talking hamster, Hariham Harry, fall from the sky onto her balcony. As Hana forms a bond with Hug-tan, the city is attacked by a monstrous creature that feeds on people's energy. In her quest to protect Hug-tan and her new friends, Hana discovers her ability to transform into a powerful hero, Cure Yell, with the help of a magical heart-shaped gem. Hana learns that the sinister Criasu Corporation, responsible for the monster, seeks to steal Future Crystals, embodiments of hope and dreams, to control time. Joined by her classmates Saaya Yakushiji and Homare Kagayaki, who also become heroes, Hana forms the Hugtto PreCure team to protect the world's future and the precious crystals from the clutches of the evil corporation.",
