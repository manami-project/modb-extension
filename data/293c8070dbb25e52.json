    "text": "Exchange student Miia, the centaur Centorea, and mermaid Mero have fallen victim to the delectable cuisine prepared by their host, Kimihito Kurusu, resulting in unwanted weight gain. To tackle this issue, they are granted early access to a new pool and gym facility, courtesy of Polt. However, the girls' competitive nature transforms their workout session into a spirited competition. Simultaneously, Rachnera Arachnera receives a letter from her former host family, expressing their desire to apologize for past events and have her return to their household. When the family's daughter, Ren Kunanzuki, arrives at Kimihito's residence, the group must persuade her to allow Rachnera to remain with them. This anime episode is an adaptation of the 17th chapter from the fourth volume of the manga series, focusing on the pool visit of Miia, Centorea, Mero, and Kimihito. The OVA is bundled with the 11th and 12th volumes of the manga.",
