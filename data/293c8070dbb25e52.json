  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Kimihito Kurusu, a young man who is hosting several monster girls as part of a \"Cultural Exchange\" program. During a physical exam, three of the monster girls - Miia (a snake girl), Centorea (a centaur), and Mero (a mermaid) - are found to have gained too much weight due to enjoying Kimihito's delicious cooking. To help them lose weight, their coordinator Ms. Smith arranges for them to use a new gym facility that is about to have its grand opening. Miia, Centorea, and Mero excitedly head to the gym along with Kimihito. However, their competitive spirits soon lead to conflict. Meanwhile, Rachnera, a spider girl also staying with Kimihito, receives a letter from her previous host family. They want to apologize for the events that led to her transfer and ask her to come back. Their daughter Ren shows up at Kimihito's door, seeking to bring Rachnera home. This causes distress for Rachnera and tension within the household as they convince Ren to allow Rachnera to remain there. In the end, wacky antics and interspecies cultural differences collide, leading to hilarious misunderstandings. But the warmth of the makeshift family prevails despite the chaos.",
