    "text": "The 'Capsule Project' is an initiative by Bilibili to support China's animation industry. It brings together professional teams to create original short animations centered around intense emotions. Spanning a variety of visual styles and perspectives, the project encapsulates a selection of captivating stories. These include tales of childhood innocence left behind, the thrill of extreme experiences, fleeting moments of sunlight amidst the rain, an unconventional teacher's passion for learning, the anguish of mental illness, reflections on the cycle of life, overcoming daily adversity, cherishing the present, superhero adventures in space, bottled lightning, a restaurant of surprises, the dual nature of humanity, and ponderings on the boundaries between worlds. Though different in their particulars, each short animation promises to take audiences on an emotional journey that affirms the resonance of our shared humanity.",
