    "text": "After being hired by the prestigious Drossel royal family, Violet Evergarden, a skilled Auto Memories Doll, embarks on a new mission to teach etiquette and refinement to Isabella York, a student at an elite girls' academy. Isabella, who hails from a well-connected family, initially views the school as a gilded cage and resents her predetermined future among the nobility. Despite her cold demeanor, Violet sees beyond Isabella's defiance and uncovers a painful past marked by poverty and separation from her younger sister, Taylor Bartlett.\n\nAs Violet forms a bond with Isabella, she empathizes with her struggles and encourages her to express her true feelings. With the help of Benedict and the emotional power of letters, Violet sets out to reconnect Isabella with her estranged sister. As they work together, Isabella begins to see Violet not just as a tutor, but as a friend who understands her heartache. In this touching tale of friendship and self-discovery, Violet Evergarden helps Isabella find the strength to confront her past and embrace her future.",
