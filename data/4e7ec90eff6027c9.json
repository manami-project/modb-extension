His choice falls on the legendary Mr. Unchained, a.k.a. Biscuit Oliva, who resides in the notorious Arizona State Prison, dubbed the \"Black Pentagon.\" To reach Oliva, Baki deliberately gets himself incarcerated, only to discover that the prison is a battleground where only the strongest prevail. As Baki navigates the treacherous world of the Black Pentagon, he encounters other extraordinary fighters eager to test their mettle against the newcomer. Meanwhile, five of the world's deadliest death row inmates gather to challenge Baki, hoping that he will be the one to finally crush them in combat. In response, a group of underground martial artists joins Baki's side, preparing for an epic showdown.",
