  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese animation takes a unique turn with this 'slow-life' comedy series that captures the mundane yet amusing aspects of daily life. Using motion-captured improvisational acting and computer animation, the series presents a collection of comedy shorts that resonate with real-life situations and conversations. From the music debut of a budding idol to the more personal topic of underwear, the series covers a variety of entertaining subjects. Originally screened in Japanese cinemas to liven up waiting times, this ennui-style comedy offers a refreshing take on the ordinary.",
