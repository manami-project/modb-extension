    "text": "This psychological anime explores the complex dynamic between a mother and son. One fateful day, a young boy is separated from his mother's hand and loses his fingers as a disturbing consequence. In an inexplicable supernatural twist, his severed fingers transform into insect-like larvae and detach from his hand, taking on a life of their own. Within the concealed walls of their home, the boy and his mother harbor a relationship shrouded in secrecy. Robbed of his fingers, the boy must navigate childhood and adolescence under her unconventional love. Their house serves as a sanctuary, shielding the bizarre nature of their bond from the outside world. As the boy grows, how will the loss of his fingers and his mother's smothering distorted affection shape him? This anime promises an unsettling examination of familial ties and the often fine line between caring and obsession.",
