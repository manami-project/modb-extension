  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a cosmic chase involving four vibrant orbs and a menacing dark red orb culminates in a catastrophic battle, the blue orb plummets to Earth, landing in the bedroom of an unsuspecting girl named Michiru. The dark red orb also materializes on Earth, assuming the form of a boy who engages in the illicit activity of raising Mejiro birds. As Michiru visits a bustling flea market in a park, a massive swarm of Mejiro birds descends from the sky, initiating a vicious assault on the unsuspecting patrons. In an attempt to quell the chaos, the yellow, silver, and purple orbs intervene, but their efforts are futile as the birds' aggression persists. Amidst the turmoil, Michiru hears a mysterious voice in her head, pleading with her to save the Mejiro birds. This highly anticipated anime was originally slated for release on March 14, but the event was ultimately cancelled due to concerns surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic.",
