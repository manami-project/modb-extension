  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The world is plunged into chaos as children mysteriously vanish from their beds, lured by an enchanting melody. A sinister force, led by the wicked queen Badiyanu, is orchestrating these abductions to harness the power of the children's dreams, fueling the ominous 'Black Dream Hole' that threatens to consume the Earth.\n\nAs the Sailor Soldiers, led by Sailor Moon, race against time to rescue the children and thwart Badiyanu's evil plan, they encounter unexpected allies and formidable adversaries. Among them is Peruru, a conflicted minion of Badiyanu who befriends Chibiusa and begins to question his loyalty to the evil queen.\n\nWith the help of the three warriors of the outer solar system - Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, and Sailor Pluto - the Sailor Soldiers storm Badiyanu's marzipan castle, determined to save the children and prevent the impending darkness from engulfing the world. Will they succeed in their mission, or will Badiyanu's power prove too great to overcome? The fate of the Earth and its children hangs in the balance.",
