    "text": "Sally is a fun-loving young witch who would rather play than study magic, much to her parents' chagrin. When she sneaks away to the human world, she meets and befriends two girls her age named Yoshiko and Sumire. Enchanted by life among humans, Sally decides to stay and live in disguise as an ordinary girl. With the help of her loyal shapeshifting follower Kabu, Sally strives to keep her magical identity hidden so she can rebuild her friendship with Yoshiko and Sumire after having to erase their memories previously. As Sally adjusts to her new dual life, she finds adventure and purpose helping humans in everyday troubles with her magic while also learning important life lessons about friendship and responsibility from her experiences in the human world. Though Sally faces challenges balancing her magical and human identities, her kind heart leads her to persevere in order to keep enjoying her newfound friendships and exciting exploits.",
