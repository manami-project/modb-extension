    "text": "Sally's coronation in the magical realm is interrupted by the distress of her human friends, Sumire and Yoshiko, back on Earth. Ignoring her parents' caution, she rushes to their aid, but the use of magic in front of humans forces her to erase their memories. Determined to rekindle their friendship, Sally decides to stay on Earth, helping other humans while keeping her magical identity a secret. This new chapter follows the original series, presenting a reboot with the same lovable, mischievous witch.\n\nSally, a spirited and rebellious witch, finds herself drawn to a department store on Earth by an advertising balloon. There, she encounters Sumire and Yoshiko, two girls her age, and yearns for their friendship. Once she earns their trust, Sally, accompanied by her loyal follower, Kabu, chooses to live among humans, disguising herself as one of them. As she navigates her new life, Sally discovers that there are values more significant than magic.\n\nTired of her magical studies, Sally, a youthful witch, seeks excitement in the human world against her parents' wishes. After forming a bond with Yoshiko and Sumire, she decides to remain on Earth, concealing her magical identity. With Kabu, her shapeshifting companion, and her new friends, Sally embarks on a series of adventures, balancing her desire to have fun with the need to protect her secret.",
