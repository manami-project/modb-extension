    "text": "Sugou, a skilled pilot once serving the 15th Integrated Task Force of the National Defense Army, finds himself at a crossroads when a Ministry of Foreign Affairs scout extends an invitation for him to return to the military. As he ponders this decision, memories of his final mission, the covert Operation Foot Stamp, come flooding back. The operation, targeting the Southeast Asian Union, turned disastrous for the ground forces, and Sugou's First Guardian drone was deployed for air support and supply drop, only to be ordered back to base against his better judgement. The mission left a trail of casualties, including Sugou's commanding officer, Itsuki Ootomo.\n\nFast forward three months, and an unmanned combat drone wreaks havoc at the Ministry of Defense in Tokyo. Amidst the chaos, Ootomo, believed to be deceased, is captured on camera, turning him into a prime suspect for this act of terrorism. Sugou, now an Enforcer, teams up with Tomomi Masaoka of the Criminal Investigation Department's Division One to track down his former mentor and unravel the truth behind the attack. All of this unfolds in the summer before Akane Tsunemori's assignment to Division One of the Public Safety Bureau's Criminal Investigation Department.",
