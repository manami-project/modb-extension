  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime centers around Teppei Sugo, an ace pilot in the military who joins an operation in Okinawa. During this operation, called Footstamp, Sugo is ordered to abandon his comrades on the ground despite believing they needed support. Many lives are lost. Three months later, Sugo's former commanding officer Itsuki Ootomo, believed dead in Footstamp, is spotted at the scene of a terrorist attack on the Ministry of Defense. Enforcer Tomomi Masaoka from the Criminal Investigation Department begins investigating the connection between these two events. The story likely explores the mysteries around Operation Footstamp and Ootomo's reappearance, while examining themes of duty versus conscience through Sugo's character. Overall, this appears to be an action-drama that unravels a complex conspiracy.",
