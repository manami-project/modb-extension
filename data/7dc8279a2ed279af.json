  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To protect his loved ones from an onslaught of supernatural creatures, middle school student Ushio Aotsuki must team up with the very monster he unintentionally released from captivity. Centuries ago, Ushio's samurai ancestor vanquished this ferocious beast using the legendary Beast Spear, trapping it beneath the Aotsuki family temple. As Ushio grapples with the truth behind his father's seemingly absurd tales, he finds himself reluctantly forming an alliance with the newly-named Tora to combat the incoming demonic forces. This thrilling 39-episode anime, split into two seasons, takes viewers on an action-packed journey as Ushio and Tora face their destiny together, culminating in a climactic final battle that coincides with the manga's conclusion.",
