  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shouya Ishida is a popular elementary school student who bullies a deaf transfer student named Shouko Nishimiya, encouraging his classmates to bully her as well. However, when Shouko's mother complains to the school, Shouya is singled out as the ringleader. Shouko transfers to another school, and Shouya becomes the victim of bullying himself, friendless and ostracized through the rest of elementary school and into high school. Years later, filled with deep regret over his past actions, high schooler Shouya learns sign language and seeks out Shouko in order to make amends and befriend her. Still haunted by the harm he caused, his path to redemption is filled with setbacks as he struggles to forgive himself and earn forgiveness from others. Yet he perseveres in trying to right past wrongs. This poignant coming-of-age story compassionately explores bullying, regret, and the power of kindness to heal wounds through the journeys of Shouya and Shouko. With emotional depth and beautiful animation, \"A Silent Voice\" depicts the universal human struggles of youth in a memorable, uplifting tale of redemption.",
