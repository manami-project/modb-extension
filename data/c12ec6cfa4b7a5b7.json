    "text": "Serving justice to malevolent spirits is the specialty of Muhyo and Roji, a dynamic duo operating a magical law firm. In a world where ghosts and youkai threaten the living, these experts in supernatural law are the ones to call when you're a victim of unwanted spirit possession or haunted by a troublesome ghost. Utilizing a range of magical laws, they judge the fate of these spirits, with sentences varying from absolution to eternal banishment in hell. However, if the punishment is deemed unjust, the sentence falls upon the executor. Join Muhyo, a skilled executor, and his assistant Roji as they navigate through their ghost hunting investigations, ensuring that justice is served in every case. (Source: Original Synopsis)",
