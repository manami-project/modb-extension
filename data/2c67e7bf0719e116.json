  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the distant future, the Earth has been split into two hemispheres. The southern hemisphere was carried off into space while the northern hemisphere remained on Earth's axis, now inhabited by beast-like humanoids called \"Beasts\" who can morph into animal forms. The humans from the southern hemisphere eventually return to reclaim the north, seeing the Beasts as freaks. This leads to a war between the humans, led by Uranus, and the Beasts. Three prominent Beast leaders - Wan of the Tiger Tribe, Bud of the Bird Tribe, and Mei Mer of the Mermaid Tribe - get captured along with Mei Mer's companion Tuttle. However, they manage to escape prison with the help of a young girl named Yuni, granddaughter of a human scientist named Dr. Password. Both the humans and Beasts are now racing to find a mythical treasure called Gaia. The Beasts believe Gaia will allow their tribes to survive and see it as the key to protecting their land from the invading humans. Pursued by Uranus's ruthless minions V-Darn, V-Sion, and Akumako, this unlikely band of misfits - joined by Yuni - go on a quest to find Gaia first while bickering constantly amongst themselves. Along the way, they utilize their morphing abilities and their Jinns, clan totems endowed with the spirits of animal gods. Though comically mismatched, the Beasts share a common goal that just might be enough to overcome their differences.",
