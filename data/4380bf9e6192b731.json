  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the distant future of 2199, the human race finds itself on the brink of extinction, as the relentless Gamilon alien forces wage a devastating war against Earth. With their advanced technology, the Gamilons decimate the planet's surface, leaving it uninhabitable due to radioactive contamination. As Earth's underground shelters weaken, humanity's survival hinges on a single glimmer of hope: a mysterious device called the Cosmo-Cleaner D, offered by Queen Starsha of the distant planet Iscandar.\n\nThis powerful device promises to eradicate Earth's radiation, but there's a catch. To obtain it, a brave crew must embark on a perilous 148,000 light-year journey to Iscandar and return within the span of a single year. With time running out, humanity's last hope lies in the hands of the crew aboard the Space Battleship Yamato, a repurposed World War II vessel.\n\nAs the Yamato ventures into the vastness of space, the fate of the human race hangs in the balance. Will the crew succeed in their mission and save Earth from the clutches of the Gamilons, or will humanity face its ultimate demise? Join the crew of the Yamato as they embark on an epic quest filled with adventure, danger, and the indomitable human spirit.",
