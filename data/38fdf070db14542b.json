    "text": "The silver-haired samurai, Gintoki Sakata, and his cash-strapped companions, Shinpachi and Kagura, find themselves in a series of comedic escapades in an alien-infested Japan where samurais are no longer revered. One day, the trio decides to enjoy the spring blossoms, only to find their spot contested by the Shinsengumi. The dispute escalates into a chaotic game of rock-paper-scissors, with a violent twist. Meanwhile, Kotarou Katsura, the leader of the Anti-Foreigner Faction, is determined to restore the samurai's honor by eliminating the aliens, even if it means confronting the Shinsengumi. Will Gintoki and his friends manage to claim their flower-viewing spot, or will Katsura's giant mecha disrupt their plans? Join Gintoki and his friends as they navigate through hilarious adventures in a futuristic Edo.",
