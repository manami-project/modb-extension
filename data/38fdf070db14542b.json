  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story is set in a futuristic version of Edo that has been invaded by aliens called Amanto. Samurai have lost their status and struggle to make ends meet. Gintoki Sakata, a silver-haired samurai, runs an odd-jobs business with his friends Shinpachi and Kagura. In this OVA comedy special, Gintoki, Shinpachi and Kagura go out to appreciate the cherry blossoms. However, the Shinsengumi police force soon arrives, claiming that Gintoki has stolen their reserved flower-viewing spot. This leads to a comedic quarrel between the two groups, which they decide to settle through a violent game of rock-paper-scissors. Meanwhile, the radical Anti-Foreigner Faction leader Kotarou Katsura aims to restore the samurais' honor by attacking the Shinsengumi with a giant mecha. Though his methods are extreme, Katsura is determined to free Japan from the tyranny of the Amanto aliens. With the Shinsengumi distracted, Katsura may have an opportunity to initiate his attack. The special balances absurd comedy against the grim backdrop of a Japan that has lost its traditions. Ultimately, it remains to be seen whether the flower viewers or extremists will prevail.",
