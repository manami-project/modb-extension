  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To the outside world, Sara Crewe, a young girl of British descent born in India, appears to have it all - a privileged upbringing, a prestigious London boarding school, and a doting father. However, when tragedy strikes and Sara's father passes away, leaving her penniless and orphaned, her once charmed life takes a dark turn. Forced to work as a maid in the very same school she once attended as a student, Sara must confront the cruel realities of her new life under the harsh rule of the headmistress. Yet, even in the face of adversity, Sara remains steadfast, drawing strength from her vivid imagination and the friendships she forges along the way. Based on Frances Hodgson Burnett's beloved novel 'A Little Princess,' this anime adaptation is a testament to the power of resilience and the human spirit.",
