    "text": "Sara is a young girl born into a wealthy British family living in India. When her father goes abroad for work, Sara is sent to an upscale all-girls boarding school in London. Initially welcomed warmly due to her affluent background, Sara excels both socially and academically at the school. Tragedy soon strikes when Sara learns her father has passed away, leaving the family bankrupt. Stripped of her student status, Sara is forced by the stern headmistress to work as a maid at the school in exchange for poor room and board. Formerly friendly classmates now shun Sara due to her fallen social status. Despite enduring unkind treatment from peers and staff, Sara perseveres with resilience and imagination. She forms new friendships and finds small joys through fantasy, maintaining hope amidst adversity. Though dealt unfortunate circumstances out of her control, Sara meets her challenges with grace and dignity.",
