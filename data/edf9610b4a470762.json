  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akio, a young boy residing in the breathtaking Hisui region, has always been taught by his father that coexistence between humans and Pokémon is impossible. Raised with the belief that these mysterious creatures, especially the unpredictable Zoroark, are to be feared, Akio's life takes an unexpected turn when he encounters a wild Hisuian Zorua. As their paths cross, Akio begins to question his father's teachings and discovers the possibility of forming a profound bond with the Zorua. Set against the backdrop of the world introduced in Pokémon LEGENDS: Arceus, this new adventure challenges the preconceived notions of humans and Pokémon living together and invites viewers to explore the transformative power of friendship.",
