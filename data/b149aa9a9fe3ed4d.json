However, after an unexpected series of events, Shizuku's cross-dressing dance videos catch the attention of a talent agency. She makes her professional debut by joining an all-male idol dance group alongside none other than her rival, Hayate. Forced to share close quarters with him, Shizuku must keep her identity secret while navigating a complicated relationship with Hayate, who starts to develop feelings for her feminine side. As Ai and Hayate continue their friendly rivalry through dance, Shizuku walks a fine line struggling between her blossoming career, an evolving romance, and concealing her true self from her fans and colleagues.",
