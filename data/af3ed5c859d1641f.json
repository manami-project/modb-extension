  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two years after saving the world from a catastrophic event, Cloud Strife leads a quiet life making deliveries with his childhood friend Tifa Lockhart. Though their former allies have moved on, Cloud and Tifa find peace caring for two orphans, Marlene and Denzel. Their lives are disrupted when a strange illness called Geostigma spreads through the slums. At the same time, Cloud comes under attack from three silver-haired youths seeking their mother, whom they believe is connected to Cloud's past nemesis, Sephiroth. As Cloud battles his inner demons and the youths stalk his loved ones, it becomes clear Sephiroth's influence still threatens the planet. To protect his makeshift family and prevent Sephiroth's will from prevailing, Cloud must reconnect with his former allies and confront the shadows of his past. This movie expands on the original Final Fantasy VII story with new footage exploring the disease's origins, the antagonists' backstories, and an extended final battle. While the core narrative remains the battle between Cloud and Sephiroth, the heart of the film is Cloud's struggle to preserve the fragile peace he's found and defend those he holds dear.",
