    "text": "From the ashes of the first Demon War, Tokyo and its elite defense force, the Imperial Floral Assault Unit, have emerged stronger than ever. But as the cherry blossoms bloom, a new threat looms on the horizon. Mechanized armies, fueled by the fury of Hell, are marching towards the capital, igniting the second Demon War.\n\nThe Imperial Floral Assault Unit, comprised of eight extraordinary women, is humanity's last hope. Each member, a unique blend of mental and physical prowess, is a seasoned warrior who has already saved the world once. But as the enemy draws near, internal discord threatens to shatter their unity.\n\nEnter Ichiro Ogami, a young Navy man appointed as their commander. His mission: to unite these formidable women and lead them into battle. But with tensions running high and jealousy simmering beneath the surface, will love conquer all, or will envy be their downfall?\n\nAs Ogami prepares for a mission in Paris, he finds himself reminiscing about his teammates and their shared adventures. From deadly overseas assassins to haunted studios and the looming specter of arranged marriages, they've faced it all together. With the future uncertain, Ogami draws strength from the unbreakable bonds he's forged with his team, ready to face whatever lies ahead.",
