    "text": "Ronald Knox, a grim reaper, and his flamboyant partner Grell are not the only obstacles in the path of Ciel Phantomhive and his demonic butler, Sebastian, as they investigate the mysterious Aurora Society on the maiden voyage of the luxury liner Campania. Rumors of necromancy and resurrection of the dead have led the demonic duo to go undercover among the society's members, but what they discover is far more sinister than they could have imagined. As the ship sails on, Ciel and Sebastian find themselves surrounded by the undead and running out of time to solve the mystery before they become the next victims. With the fate of their own lives and those of the ship's passengers hanging in the balance, Ciel and Sebastian must uncover the truth behind the Aurora Society's phoenix symbol and put an end to their nefarious activities. Will they be able to unravel the mystery in time, or will they meet a watery grave?",
