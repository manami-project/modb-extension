  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The interstellar musician, Basara, finds himself stranded on a frosty planet while probing an enigmatic sound disturbance. Initially, the local inhabitants greet him with hostility, but a shared love for music soon bridges the gap. A young boy named Pedro, an ardent admirer of Basara's alter ego, Fire Bomber, becomes his ally. Together, they embark on a quest to uncover the source of the mysterious sound. Their investigation leads them to Emilia, a solitary Meltrandi, who strives to create her own melodies. As Basara and Emilia engage in a musical duet, little do they suspect the peril that their harmonious performance might attract. Meanwhile, Mylene, driven by jealousy, sets off on a mission to locate Basara, adding another layer of complexity to their icy adventure.",
