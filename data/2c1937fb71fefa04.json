  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Asahi Ikusaba is an ordinary high school boy who ends up transported to a magical fantasy world after an accident. Eager to explore this new world, Asahi hopes to use his knowledge of video games and fantasy stories to thrive. However, he soon discovers that his abilities are extremely weak compared to the inhabitants of this world. Just as Asahi faces attack from a vicious monster, his doting older sister Maya appears. Possessing the strongest \"cheat\" abilities, Maya easily dispatches the threat. It seems Maya followed Asahi to this world, unwilling to leave her beloved younger brother's side. With her overpowered skills and sisterly affection, Maya resolves to protect Asahi no matter what dangers arise. Though lacking in power himself, Asahi finds security in Maya's presence. Together, the siblings adjust to living in a fantastical land filled with magic, monsters, and intrigue. Yet there are hints that their arrival serves a greater purpose. As a demon army approaches, led by an overwhelmingly mighty king, Maya may be the only one capable of taking a stand against this impending doom.",
