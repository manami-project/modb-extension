  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in an alternate Edo period Japan, a mysterious and deadly disease known as the Redface Pox has decimated the male population, leaving women to fill the void in leadership roles, including that of the Shogun. With men now a rare commodity, they are cherished as givers of life and the most handsome among them are chosen to serve in the Shogun's Inner Chambers, known as the Oooku. The current Shogun, Yoshimune 'Nobu' Tokugawa, seeks to uncover the origins of this matriarchal society and the strange customs that have arisen as a result of the plague. As she delves into the history of the Oooku, she discovers the story of the first female Shogun, Iemitsu Tokugawa, and the role of a young monk named Arikoto Madenokoji in shaping the current state of affairs. With a strict isolationist policy in place to hide the true state of Japan from the rest of the world, Yoshimune is determined to fix the rampant inequality and wastefulness of her country.",
