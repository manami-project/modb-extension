In a dystopian future where Mars is on the brink of extinction, Eve resides in a secluded forest, attending a unique school designed to hone her powers. With no recollection of her past and a recurring nightmare of fire and devastation, her life takes a drastic turn when she encounters Dew, a determined boy on a quest to awaken the Messenger, a being who has been in stasis for 25,000 years and holds the key to their survival. As Eve and Dew race against time to awaken the Messenger, they face opposition from those who place their faith in science and technology. Amidst the chaos, Eve and her fellow gifted students at the school, known as EYES, strive to unlock their forgotten pasts and forge a new future for their dying world.",
