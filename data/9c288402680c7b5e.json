    "text": "In a future where humanity has urbanized Mars, a totalitarian government controls the planet. However, a secret organization kidnaps psychically gifted children and trains them to use their abilities. These abilities allow them to perceive the life energy of living beings. One of these children is a young girl who befriends an elder student. A street urchin boy later arrives to help her. Meanwhile, the girl's worried parents await the chance to see their daughter one last time. Though the government tries to exert control, hope lies with the secret organization and its psychically powered wards. Their special abilities may be the key to resisting oppression and securing freedom for Mars.",
