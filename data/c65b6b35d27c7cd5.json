  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Although they share a deep bond and a love for music, high school seniors Mizore Yoroizuka and Nozomi Kasaki find their friendship tested as they prepare for their final performance together in their school's brass band. As they practice the challenging duet \"Liz and the Blue Bird,\" inspired by a fairy tale, the two friends begin to realize that their time together may be coming to an end. Mizore, a reserved oboe player, and Nozomi, an outgoing flutist, must navigate their complex emotions and confront the reality that their friendship may not last forever. Set against the backdrop of Maurice Maeterlinck's play L'Oiseau Bleu, this poignant tale explores the intricacies of friendship and the pain of growing apart. As the performance draws near, Mizore and Nozomi must find a way to overcome their differences and perform the duet that has come to symbolize their relationship. Will they be able to reconnect and find harmony, or will they be forced to accept the inevitable and go their separate ways?",
