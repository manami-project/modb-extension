    "text": "In a fantasy world where Spirits and Humans coexist, love often blossoms between the two races. However, due to the vastly longer lifespans of Spirits, they inevitably watch their Human lovers grow old and die, while their memories of the Spirits fade with each reincarnation. To rekindle lost love, a mysterious group of Fox Spirit Matchmakers offers their services to revive the memories of former lovers. When Spirits lose their partners, they seek out these matchmakers to restore their lover's memories so they can reconnect and continue their romantic story. This anime follows a young, earnest Fox Spirit Matchmaker who strives to reunite Spirit-Human couples. Using her magical abilities, she tracks down reincarnated Humans and helps them regain their forgotten memories of loving Spirits in their previous life. Through her work and determination, romantic connections are rekindled and Spirits and Humans who yearn to be together again finally find their happy ending.",
