  "synopsis": {
    "text": "These delightful Ore, Tsushima shorts follow the everyday adventures of an elderly cat-loving woman, affectionately referred to as \"Ojiichan,\" and her eclectic feline family. When Ojiichan encounters a chatty stray cat named Tsushima, she welcomes him into her home, where he joins her existing brood of quirky cats: Zun, the house cat; Chaa, the pampered and timid feline; and Osamu, the self-centered gangster cat. As Tsushima, the leopard cat with a sluggish demeanor, settles into his new life, the group's daily antics become even more colorful and endearing. Streamed on the Asmik Ace YouTube Channel, this web anime invites viewers to witness the heartwarming chaos that unfolds in Ojiichan's cat-filled household.",
