    "text": "Once every century, ten legendary mahjong tiles called the Pai appear, granting any wish to whoever gathers them all. Monsters infected with dark magic have come to possess the tiles, and a bizarre group of girls with special abilities are fighting to claim them. There's Suuchiipai, a schoolgirl who transforms into a mahjong-themed superheroine. Milkypai is a rabbit-shaped alien invading Earth for the tiles. Cherrypai is a maid dominatrix who uses black magic in her quest. Lemonpai is a military cyborg yearning to become human again. And Peachpai is a pop idol from the magical world masquerading as a singer. Though they have little in common, these unique girls band together when necessary to battle the tile-holding monsters. But they also fiercely compete with each other for the wish-granting tiles. With imaginative transformations and special powers, they take on their monster and human foes alike in unpredictable showdowns. Who will ultimately gather the full Pai and have their greatest desire granted? The race is on in this zany anime filled with magic, sci-fi, comedy, and more!",
