    "text": "Mahjong-themed magic, alien invasions, and transforming superheroes collide in this action-packed anime! Every century, the legendary Pai - magical Mahjong tiles with the power to grant any wish - appear on Earth, hidden within formidable monsters. A diverse group of extraordinary women, each with their own unique abilities and desires, embark on a quest to collect the Pai, battling both the monsters and each other in the process. From a dominatrix maid wielding black magic to a military cyborg longing for humanity, a rabbit-shaped alien seeking world domination, a psychic girl disguised as an idol singer, and an ordinary Tokyo girl turned crime-fighting superhero, these fierce competitors will stop at nothing to make their dreams a reality. As the battle for the Pai intensifies, only one question remains: who will emerge victorious and claim the ultimate prize?",
