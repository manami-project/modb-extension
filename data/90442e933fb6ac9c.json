  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Akeno, Koneko, and Kiba are seasoned devils, each with their unique roles, from gaming to gourmet cooking and luxurious massages. To learn the ropes, newcomers Issei and Asia observe their seniors. However, their most intriguing assignment comes when Rias, their president, takes them to investigate a potentially cursed sarcophagus at an Egyptian museum. During the examination, an ancient Egyptian magician named Unas takes control of Issei's body, refusing to leave until his curse is lifted. This curse was placed on him by a devil whom Unas had attempted to make his bride.\n\nMeanwhile, a disturbing rumor circulates at school, with girls mysteriously falling ill and experiencing a decrease in breast size. The connection between the rumor and the recent absence of large-breasted girls from school becomes apparent, leaving Hyoudou Issei unsettled. A confrontation with a rogue demon alchemist, who ominously declares that he has accomplished his goal before being sent back to the demon world, further fuels Issei's unease.\n\nIn this anime, the characters navigate their roles as devils, encountering perverted Egyptian magicians and confronting mysterious rumors surrounding the well-being of the girls at their school.",
