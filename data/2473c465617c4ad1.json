    "text": "Even in a world brimming with advanced technology and peculiar science, Bolt Crank stands out as an enigmatic mercenary with an extraordinary ability. With a penchant for consuming metal, Bolt can miraculously recreate any object he's ingested from the palm of his hand, transforming them into an array of weapons to gain the upper hand against adversaries. Despite his unconventional approach, Bolt is renowned as the world's greatest mercenary, taking on jobs that align with his moral compass and doing them his way.\n\nAs he journeys through this mystifying world, Bolt often finds himself rescuing damsels in distress and earning a few bucks along the way. Accompanying him is the Lavion, a seemingly destroyed flying ship that inexplicably remains afloat in the sky, always close to Bolt. Although his metal-eating talent and unique profession might make him seem anything but ordinary, Bolt Crank is simply a man striving for normalcy in a world where the extraordinary is the norm. Join Bolt on his thrilling adventures and witness how he navigates the challenges that come his way.",
