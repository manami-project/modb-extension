  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokyo witnesses an unusual transfer of three oni girls into a local high school, as they embark on a mission to repair the tarnished image of their kind in the human world. Equipped with the magical power of \"onipan,\" a unique blend of 'oni' and 'pantsu,' these girls transform into humans to better connect with the people around them.\n\nThe trio, each with their distinct personalities, dive headfirst into various school activities and community projects to revitalize their neighborhood. From preparing for school festivals to even becoming idols, they leave no stone unturned to win the hearts of the humans. Their newfound popularity serves as a bridge to foster better relationships between oni and humans.\n\nThis delightful anime is available in two formats: a 60-episode series of 3-minute shorts, and a condensed 12-episode series with 14-minute episodes, each containing the content of five original shorts. Join Tsutsuji, Tsuyukusa, and Himawari as they spread love, friendship, and a touch of oni magic in their quest for a harmonious coexistence.",
