  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fang Han is a humble slave who has believed since childhood that he would rather be a beggar than live in bondage. Setting off alone, he traverses the world with unyielding resolve. Through perseverance, he unravels the mysteries of supernatural powers and transforms his mortal form into an immortal body. Step by step, he strives tirelessly to ascend into the realm of immortals. Ultimately, his efforts culminate in his coronation as the Peak King. The story unfolds in a multiverse of fantasy realms deeply steeped in history. The Dali Dynasty, a sprawling human empire numbering in the billions, resides in one such realm dominated by the all-powerful Ascension Sect. Every year, the Dali Dynasty pays tribute to this Sect in precious treasures and talented individuals. In return, the Ascension Sect imparts the secrets of immortality, including mystical techniques and enchanted weapons that serve as the key to unlocking the world of gods and demons.",
