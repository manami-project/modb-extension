  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ellis is a young girl with the strange ability to manipulate particles. After accidentally killing a professor during an experiment, she flees to Mexico where she lives under the care of an elderly woman, unaware of her mysterious past. Eventually, Ellis' past catches up to her - there is a bounty on her head for the professor's murder. She crosses paths with the bounty hunter Nadie, who surprisingly befriends Ellis and decides to help her escape capture. Together, they embark on a journey south towards the fabled \"Eternal City\" of Wi√±ay Marka, hoping to uncover clues about Ellis' forgotten past along the way. Pursuing them is an underground society called the \"Hunters\" who view Ellis as a threat. Guiding Ellis and Nadie's search is a legendary gemstone called the Rosa del Inca, which seems connected to the secrets behind Ellis' powers and the shadowy \"Project Leviathan\". Through their adventures, the duo hopes to illuminate Ellis' origins and role in a larger conspiracy.",
