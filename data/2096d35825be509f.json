    "text": "Hi no Tori: Hagoromo Hen is a captivating anime movie that graced the screens of Tezuka Osamu World cinema in Kyoto from July 17, 2004, until the theater's closure on January 16, 2011. The production team bore a striking resemblance to the Hi no Tori TV anime series, with the exception of the voice actress for the Phoenix character.\n\nThe narrative unfolds around Zuku, a hunter-turned-brigand, who stumbles upon a mesmerizing robe hanging on a pine tree at a beach. In an attempt to sell it, he encounters Otoki, a time-traveler from the future, who claims the robe as her own. Mistaking her for an angel, Zuku invites her to live with him. Otoki, fearing the potential alteration of history if the robe is sold, agrees to cohabit with Zuku, and they soon become parents.\n\nOne fateful day, samurai from the capital arrive to conscript Zuku, forcing Otoki to surrender the robe to protect him. Despite his rough exterior, Zuku's life takes a profound turn following his encounter with Otoki, demonstrating the transformative power of compassion and the unlikely bonds that can form amidst adversity. This heartwarming tale, inspired by a well-known Japanese legend, promises to captivate audiences with its poignant exploration of the human spirit.",
