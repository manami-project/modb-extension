    "text": "When the Divine Gate swung open, it bridged the realms of the living, the heavens, and the underworld, plunging the world into an age of turmoil and conflict. To restore order, the World Council was established, turning the legend of the Divine Gate into a distant memory. Now, a group of extraordinary individuals, gifted with unique elemental abilities and handpicked by the council, assemble with the ambition to reach the elusive gate and reshape the world according to their desires. Among them is Aoto, a young man with a tragic past and incredible water powers, who reluctantly joins the academy alongside Midori, a lively wind user, and Akane, a headstrong fire wielder. Together, under the guidance of the enigmatic Arthur, they embark on a journey to uncover the truth behind the gate. But to achieve their goals, they must first confront their inner despair and unite against the hidden adversaries that lie in wait. Will they find a new world beyond the gate, or will it change their past and future forever? No one knows, as no one has ever returned from the Divine Gate.",
