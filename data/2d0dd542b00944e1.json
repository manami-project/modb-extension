    "text": "Of once-ordinary school days and routine commutes, Makoto finds himself thrust into a world of chaos and extraterrestrial encounters when his train is ambushed by a UFO. Enter Kokoro Katsura, a seemingly ordinary girl who moonlights as the powerful super-heroine, Magical Heart. Tasked with thwarting the nefarious scheme to transform the city's men into lecherous, mindless zombies, Magical Heart leaps into action.\n\nOriginally conceived as an April Fool's prank in 2007, this single-episode OVA serves as a spin-off to the popular School Days game developed by 0verflow. Delve into the extraordinary life of Kokoro Katsura, the younger sister of a main character, as she balances her daily life with her superhero duties.\n\nWith the city's women facing an imminent threat to their safety and dignity, Magical Heart stands as their only hope. Can she put an end to the relentless groping menace before it's too late? Join Kokoro and the rest of the School Days characters in this thrilling, magical adventure.",
