  "synopsis": {
    "text": "However ordinary his life may seem, Tadahiro Amatsu's unique eyes, each a different color, mark him as a beacon for sinister forces. As a descendant of the mystical Saniwa bloodline, he finds himself relentlessly pursued by the malevolent sorcerer Ayatachi Michimune and his demonic minions. Enter Yuzu Hieda, a dedicated Shinto priestess in training, who takes it upon herself to unravel the enigma surrounding Tadahiro's eyes.\n\nTo safeguard Tadahiro and the town from the escalating supernatural threats, Yuzu assembles a formidable team of young priestesses, comprised of her own sisters and a select group of high school peers. Under the watchful eye of Yuzu's elder sister Kurako, these five intrepid maidens embark on a rigorous journey to hone their spiritual abilities and combat the forces of darkness.\n\nAs the battle against the servants of the Evil God intensifies, so too does the bond between Yuzu and Tadahiro. Will Yuzu's burgeoning feelings for Tadahiro prove to be a source of strength or a dangerous distraction in their war against the supernatural? Join this spirited group of shrine maidens as they navigate the challenges of love, friendship, and destiny in their quest to protect their town and the one they've come to cherish.",
