    "text": "South, North, East, and West, the divine guardians unite to aid a legendary warrior in a timeless battle against darkness. Born 500 years ago in Japan's Tensho Era, the hero Kabuto defied a demon and sealed away the malevolent Black Night Demon, Kuroyasha Douki. However, the fiend has escaped his infernal prison and seeks vengeance on Kabuto's bloodline.\n\nAs a descendant of the Karasu Tengu, the Crow Goblin, Kabuto is destined to confront the forces of evil. Together with four holy ninja warriors - Genbu, Suzaku, Seiryu, and Byakko - Kabuto must face the Black Night Demon and his formidable underlings, the Junin-shu. Armed with a devilish talking sword forged by his own ancestor, Kabuto and his allies strive to save the world from darkness, just as their forebears did generations ago. In this eternal struggle, can Kabuto live long enough to witness the birth of his own sons?",
