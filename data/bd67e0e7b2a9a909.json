  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When mysterious invaders called the Septentriones arrive in Japan, two high school students named Hibiki and Daichi discover a website that shows videos predicting their own deaths. They soon die in a subway crash during an earthquake but are then given a second chance at life by a secret organization fighting the Septentriones. Hibiki, Daichi, and their friend Io join this group, called the Devil Summoners. They are granted the ability to summon demons to do battle against the powerful Septentriones, who appear daily with the goal of eradicating mankind in just seven days. Fighting alongside the Devil Summoners are other gifted civilians bonded with demons. Under the direction of an underground agency led by Yamato, this unlikely army wages war for humanity's very survival. With the clock ticking down each day, Hibiki and his allies must defeat the Septentriones at all costs. It is a grueling battle pitting demons against demons under human command. Death looms constantly, forcing cruel decisions about who lives and dies. Yet the young heroes persevere, determined to send the invaders back to hell and prevent the apocalypse - even if many lives are sacrificed to win the ultimate conflict between good and evil.",
