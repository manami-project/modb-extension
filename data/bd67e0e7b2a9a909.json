    "text": "Nicaea, a website known for sending pictures of one's impending death, becomes a grim reality for high school senior Hibiki Kuze and his best friend Daichi Shijima. When the duo receives their own death predictions and subsequently face their demise in a subway crash during an earthquake, they are given a second chance at life with a twist: they must join the ranks of the Devil Summoners to combat the mysterious and monstrous Septentriones, otherworldly invaders bent on eradicating mankind.\n\nTogether with their classmate Io Nitta, Hibiki and Daichi are thrust into an uneasy alliance with a secretive government organization, JP's, led by Yamato Houtsuin. As the Septentriones attack Japan daily, the trio and other ordinary citizens-turned-Devil Summoners must summon demons to fight in a war where human lives are mere game pieces. With the clock ticking down to Armageddon, the young warriors must defeat each invader before the night ends, even if it costs them their lives.\n\nAs the living, the dead, and the demonic combine forces, Hibiki, Daichi, and Io face the ultimate conflict between good and evil in a race against time to save the world from the brink of destruction in DEVIL SURVIVOR 2 THE ANIMATION.",
