  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so begins the extraordinary tale of Yuusuke, an ordinary high school student whose life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters Noelle, a lively and innocent girl from another realm, in the forest. With her heart set on becoming Yuusuke's guardian angel, Noelle and her eccentric family of supernatural beings move into Yuusuke's spacious home, turning his once mundane existence upside down.\n\nAmong Noelle's peculiar family members are her Frankenstein-like father with a passion for physical exercise, her beautiful mother with an unusual fascination for round objects, an invisible older sister named Sara, a teenage vampire brother named Gabriel, and the inventive youngest sister, Ruka. Not to forget, there's also the disapproving Grandma, a powerful witch accompanied by her vulture familiar.\n\nAs Yuusuke struggles to adapt to his new life and capture the attention of his crush, Natsumi, Noelle embarks on her journey to become an angel under the guidance of the enigmatic Michael. However, their path is filled with obstacles as mysterious adversaries attempt to thwart Noelle's aspirations, leading to a series of thrilling and unpredictable adventures.",
