  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hiro, Miyako, Sae and Yuno, the main characters, return in a promotional video announcing the second season of their anime series, Hidamari Sketch x 365. This promo video was screened at the 2007 \"Chou Hidamatsuri in Nippon Budokan\" event, where the upcoming second season was revealed. The characters cheerfully rally the crowd, building excitement for the next installment of their adventures. While light on plot details, the video indicates the main quartet will feature prominently when the show returns, likely getting into more hilarious hijinks at their art school and apartment complex. The announcement hints that fans can look forward to the same charm and comedy that made the first season a success.",
