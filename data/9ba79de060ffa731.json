    "text": "Tohoku, a tranquil countryside, echoes with the melodious tunes of a piano, played by a young girl for her cherished friends, a bear and a rabbit. Their harmony is abruptly disrupted by a violent earthquake, leaving the friends in disarray and the girl mysteriously vanished. Despite the devastation, the bear and rabbit resiliently strive to rebuild their lives, holding onto the hope that their beloved friend will return. This heartwarming tale is part of the Zapuni Project, a collaborative effort between Japanese visual artists and globally acclaimed musicians, aiming to support children affected by the Great Tohoku Earthquake and Fukushima Nuclear Disaster through the healing power of music. The anime serves as a music video, contributing to the project's mission to raise funds for various charities.",
