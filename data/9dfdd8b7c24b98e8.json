  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around Kyousuke, a chronically indecisive boy who struggles to make decisions, even minor ones. As the star festival Tanabata approaches, Kyousuke wants to invite his crush Madoka but ends up inadvertently upsetting her best friend Hikaru instead. His indecision lands him in the hospital after Hikaru's outburst. There, Madoka visits the injured Kyousuke. This direct-to-video special compiles episodes from the television series, continuing the complex love triangle between the indecisive Kyousuke, his crush Madoka, and her sensitive best friend Hikaru. With the Tanabata festival bringing emotions to the surface, Kyousuke's inability to make a choice threatens his relationships. The special leaves on a cliffhanger as Madoka reaches out to Kyousuke while he lays injured in the hospital.",
