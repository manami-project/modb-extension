    "text": "In the heart of feudal Japan, a swordsman named Manji is both feared for his deadly skills and envied for his immortality, a curse bestowed upon him by an ancient nun. Known as the 'Slayer of Hundreds,' Manji seeks redemption from his bloody past by vowing to kill one thousand evil men, hoping this will lift his curse.\n\nHis journey takes a turn when he encounters Rin, a young girl seeking vengeance for her slain family. Despite his initial reluctance, Manji sees a reflection of his lost sister in Rin and agrees to protect her. Together, they embark on a dangerous journey filled with relentless enemies and constant threats.\n\nAs they navigate through their violent path, Manji and Rin must balance their quest for revenge with their search for peace. Each step brings them closer to their goals, but also tests their resolve to not be consumed by the very vengeance they seek. Will Manji find his redemption, and will Rin avenge her family? Only time will tell in this epic tale of bloodshed, vengeance, and atonement.",
