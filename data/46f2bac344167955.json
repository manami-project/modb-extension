  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Republic and Imperial armies have long ceased their war, leaving behind a ravaged world called Gaiarth. Amidst the remnants of technomagical chaos, humans eke out a living while evading rogue robots, known as 'beasts', hell-bent on human annihilation. The attacks of these beasts are escalating, and the reason becomes clear to Ital, a boy raised by a wardroid: the 'beast-masters', part-human and part-robot controllers, have reemerged.\n\nIn a secluded outpost, Randis, a retired Imperial \"War-Roid\", had nurtured Ital in isolation, believing the war still raged on. Their peace shatters when Republic-like soldiers, led by a Beastmaster, invade, kill Randis, and destroy their home. Escaping the onslaught, Ital vows vengeance and sets out with Zaxon, a deactivated war-roid, into a world vastly changed from the war they knew.\n\nIn the city of Bangor, Ital and Zaxon are imprisoned for their striking appearance, only to face an attack by the Beastmaster's robotic army. With Sahari, a scrap collector, they must defend Bangor against the invading forces. As a reawakened evil looms, threatening Armageddon once more, Ital, Zaxon, and their newfound allies must confront the beast-masters and unravel the mystery behind their return.",
