    "text": "Touma Shinjou, the dedicated captain of a struggling junior high school's soft tennis team, faces a daunting challenge: his club is on the brink of disbandment due to poor performance and lack of funding. Desperate to save his team, Touma turns to his childhood friend, Maki Katsuragi, who has recently moved back to town and displays impressive athletic prowess. However, Maki's agreement to join the team comes with a price, further complicating Touma's mission to turn the club's fortunes around. As they strive to win at least one match in the upcoming summer tournament to secure their club's survival, the boys confront deeper personal issues that extend beyond the tennis court, shaping their journey into a compelling tale of adolescence, camaraderie, and self-discovery.",
