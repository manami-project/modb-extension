    "text": "This anime tells the tragic yet hopeful story of a mermaid driven by a longing to be loved. Defying her kind's taboo against contact with humans, she makes a fateful wish that leads to her untimely death. However, her story does not end there. Two centuries later, she is reborn in modern-day Japan's Lake Biwa, still remembering her forbidden desire. Now in a human form, she must navigate adjusting to life on land. Through her journey of loss, rebirth and self-discovery, she may yet find the love and belonging she risked everything for. Though the path is challenging, this mermaid-turned-human remains driven by an unquenchable inner light. Her story is one of tragedy and redemption, of magical beings, mortal worlds and the timeless power of love.",
