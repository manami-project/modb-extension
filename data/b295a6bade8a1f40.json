The culprit behind the wheel is none other than Izumi Yasaka, a psychological counselor employed at the Sanctuary, a rehabilitation facility for latent criminals nestled in Aomori Prefecture. However, before detectives Mika Shimotsuki and Nobuchika Ginoza can commence their interrogation, they find themselves assigned to a new mission: escort Yasaka back to Aomori. As they delve deeper into the case, they stumble upon a deceptive utopia hidden within the Sanctuary's walls. Join Shimotsuki and her team of enforcers as they peel back the layers of this false paradise, revealing the dark secrets that lie beneath.",
