    "text": "In the winter of 2117, a vehicle crashes into the Public Safety Bureau Building, driven by Izumi Yasaka, a psychological counselor who has escaped from the Sanctuary - a rehabilitation facility for latent criminals in Aomori Prefecture. Before Yasaka can be interrogated, Inspectors Mika Shimotsuki and Nobuchika Ginoza receive an urgent request to escort her back to the Sanctuary. Upon arriving at the remote facility, Shimotsuki and her team uncover troubling secrets behind its serene facade. The Sanctuary seems to present itself as a utopian sanctuary for its patients. However, Shimotsuki senses something is amiss in this supposed paradise and makes it her mission to uncover the truth, no matter how carefully hidden. As the inspectors investigate further, they peel back the layers of deception at the Sanctuary. It becomes clear that the facility has been concealing illegal activities behind its rehabilitation claims. Shimotsuki races to expose the dark secrets and bring those responsible to justice. However, powerful forces stand in her way, willing to go to great lengths to protect the Sanctuary's interests. To get to the bottom of the mystery, Shimotsuki and her team will have to put everything on the line.",
