    "text": "Lirin eavesdrops on a conversation between Dr. Ni and Gyokumen Koushu, revealing the existence of the Pearl Jade, a celestial light with the power to grant any wish. To prevent it from falling into malevolent hands, Kanzeon Bosatsu, the Merciful Goddess, enlists Genjo Sanzo and his team to locate and seal the Pearl Jade.\n\nOriginally an interactive game, the anime adaptation of Kibou no Zaika follows the journey of four distinct characters - Genjo Sanzo, Son Goku, Sha Gojyo, and Cho Hakkai - as they venture westward, confronting various adversaries and engaging in numerous side quests. Their ultimate objective is to face the formidable ox king, Gyu-Ma-Oh.\n\nIn pursuit of our protagonists is a group of empathetic antagonists, led by Gyu-Ma-Oh's son, Kougaiji. Despite his potential as a melancholic goth poet grappling with the anguish of his parents' separation, Kougaiji remains a persistent threat. With captivating characters and an engaging storyline, this anime promises a thrilling and entertaining experience.",
