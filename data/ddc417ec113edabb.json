  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Society members of Yamaboshi Academy's Student Cultural Society (StuCS) - Taichi, Iori, Himeko, Yoshifumi, and Yui - find themselves entangled in yet another supernatural ordeal, courtesy of the mischievous Heartseed. This time, they are afflicted with 'emotion sickness,' an unusual condition causing their feelings to randomly leap from one person to another. As if involuntary body swapping, age changes, and uncontrollable desires weren't enough, the group now grapples with the unpredictable transfer of their deepest emotions and fears.\n\nAs Valentine's Day approaches, the StuCS members must navigate their complex relationships while their true feelings are revealed at the most unexpected moments. To add to their troubles, their club supervisor, Ryuuzen Gotou, may have to leave his position, further destabilizing the group. With their bonds and personal secrets at stake, the StuCS members must confront their innermost emotions and face the challenges that Heartseed has in store for them.",
