    "text": "Kaga Michio is a high school student who spends much of his time wandering aimlessly on the internet. One day, he stumbles upon a strange website that allows him to create a customized character for a fantasy world, equipped with special skills and powers. Despite thinking little of it initially, Michio decides to create a character and is suddenly transported into the very fantasy world he designed, unable to log back out. Now inhabiting the body of his created character, a strong warrior, Michio possesses numerous cheat abilities. Resigned to his sudden predicament, he sets out on a journey through this new world, battling bandits, conquering dungeons to earn money, and beginning to assemble a harem of beautiful women. With his overpowered skills and manly desires, Michio aims to establish himself as an adventurer in this realm, living out his ultimate male fantasy. Though the circumstances around his arrival remain unclear, Michio appears content embracing his fresh start and new identity. His story looks to be one of wish fulfillment, action and adventure as he navigates this fantasy world on his own terms.",
