    "text": "Vehicle-shaped robots, known as 'Labors,' have revolutionized the future, serving various purposes from construction to military operations. However, with great power comes great responsibility, and these robots have fallen into the wrong hands, becoming tools for criminal activities. To counteract this threat, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department introduces specialized patrol robots, 'Patlabors,' and forms the Second Special Vehicles Division. This diverse team of officers, including Izumi and Shinohara, is initially dismissed as a joke, but they're determined to turn the tide. Armed with their new Ingram 98 patrol labors, they strive to combat labor-related crimes while balancing their everyday lives in this thrilling tale of technology and teamwork.",
