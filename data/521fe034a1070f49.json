    "text": "Madoka's peaceful life as an eighth-grader in Mitakihara Middle School is disrupted by the arrival of Homura Akemi, a transfer student with a cryptic demeanor. Homura wastes no time in warning Madoka about an impending change. Around the same time, Madoka and her best friend Sayaka Miki encounter a peculiar creature named Kyubey, who offers them a chance to become magical girls in exchange for granting them one wish. The duo learns that magical girls fight witches that spread despair in the human world. Despite the allure of the offer, the mysterious Homura strongly advises them against it. As they delve deeper into this supernatural world, they meet Mami Tomoe, a seasoned magical girl who guides them in battling witches. However, the brutal reality of these battles forces the girls to question the true cost of becoming magical girls. As the truth begins to unravel, Madoka realizes that Homura's warning was just the tip of the iceberg, and her life will never be the same again.",
