  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Madoka Kaname is living a normal life as an eighth-grade student until the arrival of the mysterious transfer student Homura Akemi. Homura warns Madoka not to change who she is, foreshadowing drastic changes ahead. Soon after, Madoka and her best friend Sayaka Miki meet Kyubey, a strange cat-like creature who offers to grant the girls any wish in exchange for them becoming magical girls. As magical girls, their duty would be fighting witches that spread despair. At first tempted by the offer, the girls witness the dark realities of witch battles after veteran magical girl Mami Tomoe takes them on a hunt. They reconsider Kyubey's contract being too dangerous. However, when another magical girl comes to town and Sayaka decides to make a selfless wish to help her love interest, events escalate quickly. Madoka and Sayaka rapidly discover the harsh truths behind the magical girl powers granted by Kyubey and the ultimate sacrifice wished-for miracles demand. Homura's warning rings true - there are shocking costs to the magic that have turned the girls' lives upside down.",
