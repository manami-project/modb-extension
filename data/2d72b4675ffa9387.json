    "text": "Pleiades' latest adventure in \"Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades - Clementine Toubou-hen\" brings back the resurrected Clementine, a former disciple of Zurrernorn 12, who once held the 9th Seat of the Black Scripture. Unbeknownst to the all-powerful Lord Ainz, Clementine returns with diminished powers and fragmented memories. Desperate to evade the theocracy and the relentless pursuit of adventurer Momon and his ally Nabe, Clementine seeks refuge outside the Kingdom.\n\nHowever, fate has other plans for her, as she repeatedly crosses paths with the battle maids, who are on a mission to gather intel on various martial arts. Each encounter with the maids, led by Albedo and accompanied by Aura and Mare, brings Clementine one step closer to being discovered by Ainz. To ensure Clementine's elimination and clear the path for their master, the maids are backed by an overwhelming force of goblins, leaving a trail of chaos in their wake. Will Clementine manage to outrun her pursuers, or will she succumb to the inevitable? Join the thrilling chase in this action-packed spin-off of the Overlord series!",
