    "text": "Clementine, a former member of the Black Scripture group, has been mysteriously revived without the knowledge of the powerful magic caster Ainz. With reduced abilities and memory issues, she goes into hiding to avoid being detected. Coincidentally, Ainz's battle maid servants have been tasked with researching martial arts, leading them to cross paths with the fugitive Clementine on their travels. This reawakens traumatic memories for Clementine. As Clementine attempts to flee the region unnoticed, she must contend with forces on multiple fronts - the theocracy she betrayed now seeks her capture, the renowned adventurer Momon is on her trail, and Ainz's devoted followers aim to eliminate any potential threats to their master. Her path to freedom is filled with adversaries at every turn. This suspenseful story follows Clementine as she navigates a treacherous landscape filled with former allies and new enemies, while trying to recover her lost memories and abilities. Can she regain her previous prowess and survive against overwhelming odds?",
