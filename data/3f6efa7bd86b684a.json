    "text": "Adapted from a popular web manga, this unique comedy introduces us to Tanaka, a high school student who has mastered the art of listlessness. With an unparalleled talent for falling asleep anywhere, anytime, Tanaka navigates through his school days with one primary goal: to preserve his tranquil, uneventful lifestyle. Aiding him in his quest for perpetual lethargy is his reliable friend, Oota, who steps in to handle tasks that demand even the slightest exertion from Tanaka. Despite Oota's energetic attempts to keep him awake, Tanaka remains steadfast in his pursuit of the perfect snooze, often dozing off mid-conversation. Join Tanaka and Oota as they traverse the trials and tribulations of high school, where every day is a testament to the extraordinary power of a good nap.",
