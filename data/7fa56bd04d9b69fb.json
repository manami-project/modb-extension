  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Few dared to tread the perilous streets of pre-war Shanghai, but one enigmatic figure known as the 'King of Death' did so fearlessly. This master of Hokuto Shinken, the lethal 'Fist of the North Star,' was none other than Kenshirou Kasumi, who had once preserved peace in the notorious 'City of Devils.' After vanquishing the city's most ruthless gangsters, he disappeared, leaving behind his beloved Pan Yu Ling and a city carved up by foreign governments and local factions.\n\nNow, Kasumi assumes the guise of a mild-mannered literature professor in Tokyo, seeking solace from his violent past. But when the death of his lover and former comrades compels him to return to Shanghai, he becomes entangled in a new web of conflict. As the city braces for another World War and the Japanese army advances, Kasumi must navigate the treacherous underworld once more.\n\nMeanwhile, Liu Fei Yan is entrusted with the task of safeguarding young Erika from the clutches of the Nazis, a mission that inadvertently intertwines with Kasumi's path. Back in Shanghai, Yu Ling has ascended as the leader of the Qing Bang Gang, while the Japanese government dispatches several martial artists to capture the elusive 'King of Death.' As the city teeters on the brink of chaos, Kasumi must confront his past, avenge his fallen comrades, and fulfill his destiny.",
