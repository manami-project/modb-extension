    "text": "In the dystopian landscape of 2020, a new threat emerges in the form of grotesque creatures known as 'Others', who descend from the heavens to feast on human brains. To combat these monstrous beings, the Other Suppression Force (OSF) is established, recruiting individuals gifted with psychokinetic abilities, thanks to a unique hormone. Among the OSF's ranks are Yuito Sumeragi, a psychokinetic youth saved by the elite team as a child, and Kasane Randall, a prodigy with extraordinary talents. As Yuito bravely undergoes rigorous training to repay his debt to the OSF, Kasane is plagued by prophetic dreams that hint at an inevitable destiny. Together, they must confront the looming conspiracy that threatens to shatter their world and save humanity from the brink of annihilation.",
