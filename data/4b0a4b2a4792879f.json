    "text": "In the year 2020, grotesque monsters called \"Others\" begin falling from the sky and attacking humans. To combat this threat, a special forces group called the \"Other Suppression Force\" (OSF) is formed. The story follows two OSF recruits - Yuito Sumeragi, a young man with psychic abilities who joins the OSF after they saved him as a child, and Kasane Randall, a mysterious girl scouted for the OSF due to her own special talents. As part of their training, Yuito and Kasane must learn to work together, along with their squadmates, to take down the Others using their psychic powers. However, Kasane has strange prophetic dreams that seem connected to Yuito, drawing the two of them into an unavoidable shared destiny. Together, they discover that the Others may not be the only threat, as a larger conspiracy seems to be unfolding behind the scenes. Yuito and Kasane must uncover the truth while continuing to protect humanity from the attacking Others. Along the way, bonds are formed and tested as the recruits brave the dangers of battle.",
