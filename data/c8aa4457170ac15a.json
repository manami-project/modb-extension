    "text": "Now here is safe when Hell's most adorable yet mischievous messenger, Chimimo, is dispatched to Earth on a mission to unleash chaos and destruction alongside his eleven demonic companions. But when a portal transports Chimimo and his partner, Jigoku-san, straight into the heart of the Onigami household, their sinister plans are put on hold.\n\nThe Onigami siblings—Mutsumi, Hazuki, and Mei—are a force to be reckoned with, and they reluctantly welcome the shape-shifting demon and his minions as their new freeloading roommates. As Chimimo and Jigoku-san adapt to their new surroundings, they find that turning the human world into hell might be more challenging than they initially thought.\n\nJoin this unlikely group as they navigate the hilarious trials and tribulations of everyday life, while Chimimo and his minions continue their quest to bring about the apocalypse... or at least find the motivation to get off the couch and try. Will these Hell-bent demons succeed, or will they succumb to the unexpected warmth and love of their human hosts? Only time will tell in this heartwarming comedy that explores the true meaning of family and the power of love.",
