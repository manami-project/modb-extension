    "text": "Valentine's Day is just around the corner, and Grell Sutcliff, a quirky grim reaper, is busy preparing a special chocolate surprise for the object of his affection, the enigmatic demon butler Sebastian Michaelis. However, his plans are disrupted by a series of unexpected visitors, starting with his fellow reaper, William T. Spears, who storms in to scold him. The chaos escalates as a motley crew of handsome men, including Lau, Soma, and even the Queen's butler, Ash Landers, crash the party. Amidst the pandemonium, Grell's wish to become the most desirable \"lady\" in the room is granted by the mysterious \"Valentine's Fairy.\" This sets off a whirlwind of romantic shenanigans, featuring original illustrations by Toboso Yana, including a fantasy kiss scene between Grell and Sebastian, a pregnant Grell, and a heart-wielding Undertaker. Even Ronald Knox, with his blonde hair and green eyes, adds to the colorful spectacle. Brace yourself for a wild, romantic ride in this special Valentine's Day episode!",
