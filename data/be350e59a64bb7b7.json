  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yana Toboso, the original creator of Black Butler, has drawn exclusive artwork for the anime's DVD release. These original pictures provide a glimpse into the imaginative mind of Grell Sutcliff, an eccentric Grim Reaper infatuated with Sebastian. In Grell's vivid daydreams, we see an intimate kiss between Grell and Sebastian, as well as an image of a pregnant Grell. More humorous drawings depict Grell enthusiastically hugging fellow reaper William and a chibi version of Grell with Lau. Toboso has also drawn the Undertaker making a dramatic entrance while swinging his signature death scythe decorated with hearts. Additionally, Ronald Knox is featured in full color, revealing his blond hair and green eyes. The DVD artwork gives fans a fun peek into previously unseen antics.",
