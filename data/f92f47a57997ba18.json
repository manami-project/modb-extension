  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hyakkimaru, a devoted admirer of Tezuka Osamu, sets aside all other opportunities to participate in a unique short animation project. The narrative unfolds around a cursed sword named 'muramasa,' discovered lodged in a straw figure. The sword's allure proves irresistible to a lone samurai, who, upon drawing it, experiences an unprecedented surge of power. However, this newfound might comes at a steep cost: the samurai's sanity begins to unravel.\n\nAs he traverses the land, the samurai encounters numerous straw figures, which he strikes down to test the blade's sharpness. In a chilling turn of events, each slain figure transforms into a human being. The tale serves as a poignant reminder to safeguard the fragile peace that exists, symbolized by the nuclear deterrence. The samurai's fate hangs in the balance as he grapples with the decision to preserve his sanity or succumb to the sword's irresistible power.",
