    "text": "This animated tale takes a modern spin on the classic Japanese Rakugo story, 'Atama-yama,' by setting it in the bustling cityscape of present-day Tokyo. The story revolves around a penny-pinching man who, after carelessly consuming cherry seeds, finds himself in an unforeseen predicament. A cherry tree has taken root and begun to flourish on his head, leading to a series of misadventures. As the tree transforms his bald head into a tourist hotspot, the stingy man must navigate the chaos that ensues.",
