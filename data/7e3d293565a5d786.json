    "text": "They are the chosen ones, the time travelers, the last hope for a world stuck in an endless loop of the same day. In this depopulated reality, a time researcher and a group of high school girls are selected to journey through time to prevent the extinction of humanity. Some are sent 6000 years into the future, a barren and unfamiliar landscape filled with strange birds and discolored rivers, while others are sent to the past, and the rest, deemed unsuitable for the technology, remain in the present. With only a toy-like cellphone as a remnant of their past lives, these brave girls must navigate the unknown and find a way to save their world. This is their journey, as depicted in an enthralling anime that explores the lengths one will go to preserve humanity.",
