  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Heavy Metal L-Gaim's OVA series presents a blend of recaps, original content, and humor. The first OVA features an exclusive comedic segment, where the cunning Gablae hatches a scheme to capture Daba. In the second OVA, the spotlight shifts to the female characters, who take center stage as wrestlers, while their male counterparts step into the role of announcers. The third OVA focuses on Leccee and the Turner crew's adventures on Gastrogal, as Leccee's defection to the rebels has tarnished her grandfather Sayi's reputation among the Group of 13. Bogedo Bulido, eager to gain Poseidal's favor, sets his sights on capturing Leccee. The first two OVAs are artfully compiled from selected scenes of the TV series, while the third OVA provides a more satisfying conclusion to the story. Additionally, the first OVA includes a light-hearted bonus clip titled 'Lady Gavlet', designed to entertain viewers with its comedic relief.",
