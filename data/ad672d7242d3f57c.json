    "text": "Kanzaki High's Literature Club is not your typical book-loving group. The club members—four girls and one boy—have been gifted with extraordinary supernatural abilities, making their everyday lives anything but ordinary. Tomoyo can manipulate time, Hatoko controls the five elements, Chifuyu creates objects out of thin air, and Sayumi can restore anything to its original state. Jurai, the only male member, has a black flame power that, while visually impressive, lacks practical use. Despite their newfound powers, the club members spend most of their time discussing literature and waiting for the day when their abilities will be called upon for something more exciting. However, with the arrival of a power-stealing student council president, things are about to get a lot more interesting in WHEN SUPERNATURAL BATTLES BECAME COMMONPLACE!",
