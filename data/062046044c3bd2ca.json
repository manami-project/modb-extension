  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Data xx Transitory depicts the disturbing outcomes when Aoba's special ability goes awry. Tasked with \"scrapping\" people's minds, Aoba usually succeeds in helping others move past trauma. However, this bonus episode explores explicit \"bad endings\" where his attempts fail catastrophically. Thrust into nightmarish scenarios, Aoba experiences gruesome and agonizing consequences each time a scrap attempt backfires. The episodes detail these failures in terrifying detail, putting Aoba through traumatic situation after situation. By witnessing these alternate outcomes, viewers gain insight into the immense responsibility and risk associated with Aoba's rare gift. Data xx Transitory serves as a stark reminder that even the best intentions can spiral into horror if not executed properly.",
