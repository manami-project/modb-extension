    "text": "He avily withdrawn from social interactions due to past traumas, Sakurada Jun spends his days indulging in an unusual hobby: ordering an array of peculiar items online only to return them before the payment is due. One day, he stumbles upon a cryptic message instructing him to place his latest order in his desk drawer. Dismissing it as a joke, he complies, only to witness the item vanish and a package appear in its place. Inside, he finds an exquisite antique doll named Shinku. Upon winding her up, she springs to life, instantly assuming Jun as her servant. Despite Shinku's constant demands, she helps Jun overcome his social fears while protecting him from the deadly battles that ensue due to her arrival. As more sentient dolls make their way into Jun's life, he finds himself entangled in a dangerous game known as the Alice Game, where these dolls, including Shinku, must compete to become Alice, a real girl worthy of meeting their creator. Based on the manga by PEACH-PIT, this anime delves into Jun's life as he navigates through this unexpected world of living dolls.",
