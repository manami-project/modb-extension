  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Megumu and Mitsuru are fraternal twins who decide to playfully swap places and attend each other's schools, seeking a change from being surrounded solely by their own gender. Megumu goes to Mitsuru's all-boys school, known for taking in delinquents, while Mitsuru attends Megumu's co-ed school. Initially, the deception goes unnoticed. However, things grow complicated when romantic feelings emerge. While posing as her brother, Megumu shares a kiss with upperclassman Aoi Sanada. The usually aloof Aoi finds himself questioning his preferences. Similarly, Mitsuru has an intimate encounter with the normally standoffish \"queen\" of the school, Azusa Tokugawa, leaving her heart aflutter. Both new couples harbor affection, unaware that the object of their interest is actually the twin sibling. As the twins navigate the ups and downs of young romance while undercover, the question looms of whether their secret identities will eventually be found out. Their lighthearted scheme takes an unexpectedly tender turn, complicating matters in ways neither Megumu nor Mitsuru had foreseen.",
