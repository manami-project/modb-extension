    "text": "Hikaru Hiyama, a first-year student with a playful and affectionate nature, falls head over heels for the newcomer, Kyosuke Kasuga, after witnessing his extraordinary basketball skills. Meanwhile, Kyosuke finds himself captivated by the enigmatic and somewhat intimidating Madoka Ayukawa, who seems to have a split personality â€“ one cold and distant, the other warm and friendly. To complicate matters further, Kyosuke and his family possess various supernatural abilities, which they must conceal from the outside world. As Kyosuke navigates the challenges of love and school, he must also grapple with his family's secret powers and the unpredictable situations they create. Set in the vibrant 1980s, this timeless tale of love, friendship, and self-discovery unfolds with a unique blend of humor, romance, and supernatural intrigue.",
