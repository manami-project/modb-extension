  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Izumi Norimoto and Kazusa Onodera, once inseparable as children, find themselves growing apart as they navigate the complexities of adolescence. As Kazusa begins to see Izumi in a new light, she finds herself ostracized by her peers and seeks solace in the literature club. Known for their provocative discussions, the club lacks a teacher willing to oversee their activities, leaving the girls to their own devices.\n\nDuring a conversation about bucket lists, one member boldly declares her desire to experience sex, sparking a whirlwind of emotions and introspection among the group. As the girls grapple with their burgeoning sexuality and the challenges of growing up, Kazusa stumbles upon Izumi in a private moment, forcing her to confront her true feelings for him.\n\nWith their emotions running high and the club on the brink of disbandment, the five young women must navigate the tumultuous path to adulthood, filled with humor, heartache, and self-discovery. Based on Mari Okada's manga, \"O Maidens in Your Savage Season\" chronicles the universal struggles and triumphs of coming of age.",
