  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a mysterious new 7G network technology is launched, it plunges Japan into chaos - causing drastic environmental changes, bizarre mutations in people, and overwriting the way of life with strange new rules. In the aftermath, most settlements have been destroyed, with the town of Agano one of the few remaining. Here, a disturbing transformation occurs - when residents turn 21, they morph into animals, retaining their human minds and speech. Shizuru Chikura, a high school student, desperately seeks her missing friend Youka Nakatomi after seeing her photo in a newspaper. With public transportation shut down, the only way for Shizuru to travel is via an abandoned train operated by senile conductor Zenjirou Taira. Shizuru decides to venture out on this risky journey, and her classmates Nadeshiko, Reimi, and Akira spontaneously join. Together, they board the ominous \"Doomsday Train\" into the dangerous outside world rife with unpredictable threats. Propelled by friendship and hope, these courageous girls hurtle towards the uncertain last stop, determined to find Youka no matter the cost. What awaits them is a one-track adventure beyond anything imagined in Agano.",
