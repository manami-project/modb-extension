  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime portrays a classic tale of hard work versus laziness by contrasting the lifestyles and fates of diligent ants and carefree grasshoppers and butterflies. The story follows a family of ants who work tirelessly all summer harvesting food, while a group of hedonistic animals spends their days reveling and mocking the ants' labor. When winter arrives, the grasshopper and butterfly who frittered away the warmer months face harsh consequences - they fall gravely ill and starve with no food reserves. Meanwhile, the forward-thinking ants are safe, healthy and comfortable inside their well-stocked home, reaping the rewards of their past efforts. Through this timeless narrative, the anime underscores an enduring message - enjoyable as idle pleasures may seem in the moment, those who fail to plan ahead for harder times often pay a heavy price later on. It's a lesson about responsibility that the young ants must learn, while their grasshopper and butterfly counterparts learn it by cruel experience.",
