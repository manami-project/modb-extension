  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ayumu Gouriki and Eiji Kakihana are the only two people that the taxi driver, Hiroshi Odokawa, can call friends. Odokawa is an eccentric individual who lives a mundane life, with his only hobby being listening to Rakugo on the radio before bed. His clients, however, are anything but ordinary. Among them are Taichi Kabasawa, a college student desperate for online fame, Miho Shirakawa, a nurse with a hidden past, and the struggling comedy duo Homo Sapiens. As Odokawa navigates the city, his interactions with these quirky characters lead him to a mystery surrounding a missing girl. Little does he know, this mystery will turn his ordinary life upside down, drawing the attention of both the yakuza and corrupt cops.",
