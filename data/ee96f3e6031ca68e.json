    "text": "The story unfolds in a quaint European town, where an organized and meticulous 11-year-old girl named Saga resides with her grandmother. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she encounters a diminutive, pink-haired fairy named Sugar, an apprentice Snow Fairy who can only be seen by Saga. Despite her initial reluctance, Saga finds herself drawn into Sugar's whimsical world, taking care of her and helping her on her quest to become a full-fledged Season Fairy.\n\nSugar, along with her fellow apprentices, the Sun Fairy Salt and the Wind Fairy Pepper, are tasked with finding elusive 'Twinkles' to make their magical flowers bloom, a prerequisite for becoming full-fledged fairies. The only hitch is that none of them have a clue what a 'Twinkle' actually is! In their pursuit, they enlist the help of Saga, whose life becomes a whirlwind of fairy antics, disrupting her once orderly existence.\n\nAs Saga and the fairies embark on this enchanting journey, they learn about friendship, teamwork, and the true essence of a 'Twinkle'. Will they be able to unravel the mystery and achieve their dream? Join Saga and her fairy friends in this delightful adventure to find out!",
