  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On his 16th birthday, Mikuri Tomokazu has a vivid dream where he witnesses a mysterious girl battling enemies in a post-apocalyptic world. When he awakens, he is shocked to find the girl, named Mone, lying next to him. Mikuri soon realizes he possesses a strange power allowing him to enter the dream world and assist Mone in her fight. As Mikuri delves deeper into this alternate reality, he learns the enemy is a sinister being named Faydoom who intends to destroy both worlds. More puzzling is the fact people from Mikuri's real life also manifest in the dreams, including his cousin and classmates. Under the guidance of a masked woman called Silk, Mikuri and Mone recruit these familiar faces, using the powers Mikuri provides to push back Faydoom's monstrous forces. Mikuri grapples with this immense responsibility thrust upon him on his 16th birthday - to save humanity itself. Yet he also revels in the affection showered upon him by Mone and her squad of battle-hardened beauties. Mikuri constantly asks himself - which girl will he fondle next in these wild dreams? And will he finally get lucky? But the fate of two worlds overshadows Mikuri's teenage urges.",
