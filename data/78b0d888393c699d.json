    "text": "All on his 16th birthday, Tomokazu Mikuri finds himself in an extraordinary situation when a dream of a girl battling monstrous entities in a desolate world turns into a reality. The mysterious girl, Mone, is no longer confined to his dreams, as she appears right beside him when he wakes up. In this new reality, Tomokazu's slumber transports him to the dream world where he is the source of power for a group of girls, including Mone, who fight against the ominous force known as Faydoom.\n\nAs the lines between the dream world and the real world blur, Tomokazu must navigate this strange dual existence where familiar faces, like his cousin Nanase and friend Mizuki, join him in the fight. Amidst the chaos, Tomokazu finds himself surrounded by a bevy of admiring girls, adding a touch of humor and romance to the high-stakes battle for the fate of both worlds. Will Tomokazu and his newfound allies triumph against the forces of Faydoom, or will they succumb to the darkness that threatens to consume them? Only time will tell.",
