    "text": "Japan's Nara period sets the stage for a riveting tale of two gifted sculptors, Akanemaru and Gao, whose lives intertwine in unexpected ways. Akanemaru, a prodigy in sculpting, ventures into the world, yearning for inspiration to create his magnum opus, the mythical Phoenix. Along his journey, he crosses paths with Gao, a one-eyed, one-armed burglar who steals more than just Akanemaru's belongingsâ€”he robs him of his peace.\n\nYears later, fate brings them together again under drastically different circumstances, forcing both men to confront their past and reevaluate their futures. Akanemaru, now compelled to abandon his dreams for a new assignment, and Gao, struck by a sudden misfortune, find themselves locked in a fierce rivalry that will forever alter their destinies.\n\nAs they grapple with their talents and the consequences of their choices, the two rivals engage in a struggle for supremacy, questioning who truly possesses the greater artistic genius. Based on the renowned Phoenix series, this animated adaptation, expertly directed by Rintaro, invites viewers to explore the delicate balance between action and consequence while immersing themselves in the captivating world of these two unforgettable characters.",
