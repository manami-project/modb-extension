    "text": "Civilization took a turn in 19th century Japan with the arrival of western black ships, introducing mechanized clockwork dolls and steam-powered devices. A group of radical enthusiasts, the Wind Gang, emerged, determined to impose the new Industrial Era through violence and chaos. In a serene village, a young clockwork controller named Hiwou and his friends lived in harmony, until the Wind Gang laid waste to their home.\n\nWith their village in ruins, Hiwou and his friends narrowly escape with Homura, a colossal clockwork doll. Embarking on a perilous journey, Hiwou seeks his estranged father, hoping to find the strength to restore peace and defeat the Wind Gang. As they traverse the rapidly changing landscape, the group discovers the true power of friendship, unity, and the potential of their extraordinary clockwork creations.",
