  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the heart of an ordinary town, the extraordinary lives of the Takagami brothers unfold as they grapple with their supernatural lineage. Descendants of the revered Mizuchi bloodline, Toru and Noboru are magnets for malevolent creatures known as Yokai. To safeguard her grandsons, the cunning matriarch of the Mizuchi family unleashes their ancestral guardian, a mischievous fox deity named Kuugen.\n\nOnce a wise and powerful entity, Kuugen was sealed away due to its playful and unpredictable nature. Now freed, the shape-shifting deity alternates between the form of a stunning woman and a dashing man, adding a touch of chaos and whimsy to the brothers' lives. Accompanying Kuugen is Ko, a somewhat scatterbrained shrine maiden, who aids in the protection of the Takagami household.\n\nAs Toru and Noboru navigate their new reality, they must confront the relentless onslaught of Yokai while adjusting to life with their unconventional guardians. Will the brothers be able to rise to the challenge and embrace their destiny, or will the complications of their supernatural existence prove to be too much to handle? Join the Takagami brothers on their thrilling and comedic journey, where the extraordinary becomes the norm.",
