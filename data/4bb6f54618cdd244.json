  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dai Mugen was once a passionate drummer, but after losing a competition to his rival Rin Tanba, he lost his motivation and gave up drumming. That changes when Dai meets Goutetsu, a self-proclaimed \"god\" who emerges from a meteorite. Goutetsu sees potential in Dai and makes him his \"oyakata\" - a coach who provides drumbeats to power Goutetsu in \"kamizumo\" battles, a form of sumo wrestling between gods. Though initially hesitant, Dai is forced to pick up the drumsticks again as he and Goutetsu start competing in kamizumo tournaments. As they rack up victories, Dai confronts his self-doubts and reignites his passion for drumming. Each god in kamizumo has a \"sumode\" form for daily life and a powered-up \"kamizmode\" form for battle. The goal in kamizumo is to become the yokozuna, the highest-ranked wrestler. Together, Dai and Goutetsu set out to conquer the kamizumo stage.",
