  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Laughing Salesman, Fukuzou Moguro, is not your typical merchant, but a purveyor of desires. He traverses the land, offering to fulfill the deepest yearnings of his clients, a proposition few can resist. However, these deals come with a dark twist. Once their unwholesome wishes are granted, Moguro's customers often face dire consequences, particularly if they dare to violate the terms of their agreement. Despite his cheerful demeanor and seemingly altruistic intentions, the true cost of Moguro's assistance may be more than anyone can afford. This chilling tale also includes a prologue, setting the stage for the unsettling encounters to come.",
