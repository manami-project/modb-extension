  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mikhail Kei Ignatov and Arata Shindou, two inspectors of CID Unit One, find themselves at odds in a society governed by the Sibyl System in Tokyo, 2120. Koichi Azusawa, a criminal mastermind, targets the CID and orchestrates an attack on the Public Safety Bureau Building, endangering Unit One and testing the loyalties of its members. As Azusawa demands the resignation of Tokyo's governor, Karina Komiya, the inspectors uncover hidden truths about their past. The movie follows the aftermath of \"Psycho-Pass 3,\" with CID Unit One hunting the elusive \"foxes\" and unraveling the enigmatic organization, Bifrost. The inspectors' friendship and allegiance are pushed to their limits as they confront Azusawa and face the secrets that have long haunted them. This thrilling story was initially released as three episodes, which were later combined into a single film and simultaneously premiered on Amazon Prime.",
