    "text": "Haruka Haruno has dreamed of becoming a princess ever since she was a little girl. She was often mocked for this dream, but a chance encounter with a boy named Kanata as a child renewed her determination. He gave her a magical charm and made her promise to never give up on her dream. Years later, 13-year-old Haruka attends Noble Academy, an elite all-girls junior high boarding school. Her dream is still alive when she meets two fairies, Pafu and Aroma, who are being chased by minions of the dark witch Dyspear. Dyspear and her organization Dys Dark aim to turn all dreams into nightmares and lock them away behind the Gate of Despair. The fairies reveal that Haruka's charm is the magical Dress Up Key, which allows her to transform into Cure Flora, the Pretty Cure of Flowers. She joins forces with Cure Mermaid and Cure Twinkle to form the Princess Precure team. Together, they fight to protect people's dreams by collecting Dress Up Keys to open the Gate of Dreams. At Noble Academy, the Precure must balance their magical duties with excitement of dorm life. By day, they attend classes and form friendships. By night, they transform into elegant princess warriors, wearing glorious gowns and unleashing magical attacks. As Haruka fights for hopes and dreams, she inches closer to making her own dream of becoming a princess come true.",
