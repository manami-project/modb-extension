  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rebellion has been crushed, the Black Knights scattered, and their enigmatic leader, Zero, presumed dead. A year has passed since the failed uprising against the Holy Britannian Empire, and the once rebellious Area 11 now cowers under the Empire's iron fist. Britannia, determined to quash any embers of defiance, has intensified its oppression of the Elevens, using brute force as a grim reminder of the cost of rebellion.\n\nIn the midst of this turmoil, Lelouch, a seemingly ordinary high school student at Ashford Academy, leads a peaceful life, oblivious to his forgotten past as the masked revolutionary, Zero. However, the tranquility of his mundane existence is shattered when he stumbles upon a conspiracy targeting his life and that of an enigmatic woman known as C.C.\n\nAs the veil of ignorance lifts, Lelouch is confronted with his buried past and true identity. With C.C.'s aid, he rediscovers his purpose and sets out to rekindle the flame of rebellion, determined to complete the mission he once started. As the mastermind Zero resurfaces, the stage is set for a thrilling conclusion to the saga of rebellion, identity, and vengeance.",
