  "synopsis": {
    "text": "World War III, ignited by an accidental nuclear explosion in 1990, left most of humanity decimated and the former USA fractured into six hostile states, largely covered in desert. Amidst the chaos, a myth persists about the existence of Oz, a city believed to be untouched by war and filled with scientific marvels.\n\nIn 2021, Felicia Epstein, a brilliant young scientist, embarks on a quest to find her missing brother, Lyon, who supposedly resides in this fabled city. Joined by a mercenary named You Mutou and an android sent by her brother, Felicia sets out on a journey filled with unexpected revelations. As they traverse the harsh landscape, they discover that the legend of Oz and Felicia's brother are not what they seemed.\n\nInspired by F. Baum's The Wizard of Oz and brought to life by Itsuki Natsumi's original manga, this tale weaves together elements of post-apocalyptic survival, familial bonds, and the pursuit of truth in a world filled with deception. Will Felicia find the answers she seeks, or will the reality of Oz shatter her hopes?",
