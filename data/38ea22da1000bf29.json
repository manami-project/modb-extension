    "text": "Age of Extinction: In the vast expanse of the cosmos, the Golden Tribe once extended an invitation to join them among the stars. Three sentient races—the Bronze, Silver, and Heroic Tribes—answered their call. As the Golden Tribe departed for another universe, a fourth race emerged, reaching the stars through their own ingenuity. The Golden Tribe named this race the Iron Tribe—humankind. Over time, humanity suffered under the dominance of the other races, pushing them to the brink of annihilation. Guided by a prophecy left by the Golden Tribe, Princess Deianeira embarks on a mission to find the powerful being who could salvage humankind. On a desolate planet, she encounters a wild-haired boy named Age, a fateful meeting that could alter not only humanity's destiny but also the universe's very fate.",
