  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Albus, a young prince named Kal-el, embarks on a daring journey to Isla, a floating island nestled in the heart of the sky. His mission? To uncover the ancient myth of the 'end of the sky.' As a student at Cadoques High's prestigious Aerial Division, he revels in the joy of camaraderie with his fellow classmates. But this idyllic existence is shattered when the air tribe launches a vicious and unexpected attack, plunging Isla into a brutal war.\n\nHaving lost everything in a devastating revolution, the once-privileged prince sets out on a perilous journey with revenge and bitterness fueling his every step. Along the way, he encounters a solitary girl who commands the wind and becomes a symbol of the revolution. Together with other young pilots, they navigate the skies aboard the flying island Isla, searching for the elusive 'end of the sky and sea.'\n\nAs they traverse the treacherous skies, the group discovers the true meaning of friendship, love, and adventure. Each member has something precious they yearn to protect, and their epic tale of love and aerial combat unfolds. With no guarantees of a safe return, this is a story of a prince who learns that even in the darkest times, love and friendship can illuminate the path to hope and redemption.",
