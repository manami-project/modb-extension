  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Both Okou and Seiji, an older sister and younger brother, run a rental shop called Izumoya in the Fukagawa ward of old Edo (present-day Tokyo), where fire and flooding are prevalent. The residents rent everyday items like pots, futons, and clothing from shops to avoid hindering their escape during disasters. Among Izumoya's inventory are tsukumogami, objects that have transformed into spirits after hundreds of years of existence. The siblings occasionally lend these sentient items to customers, and their ability to see and communicate with these spirits draws even more tsukumogami to the store. With the help of these supernatural creatures, Okou and Seiji resolve quarrels and spread love throughout the town.",
