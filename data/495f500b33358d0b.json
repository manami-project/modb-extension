    "text": "Professor Katou, a malevolent genius, spearheads the 'Tartarus Knights', a formidable group of warriors, in a catastrophic mission to annihilate the world. Their primary target is a seemingly innocuous research facility nestled on the tranquil Futagami Island. The island, however, is not as defenseless as it appears. A sophisticated fortress lies in wait, ready to protect it from any threat. The fortress unleashes its ultimate defense - a trio of powerful humanoid robots known as Dangaioh. The stage is set for an epic confrontation that could determine the fate of humanity. This thrilling saga unfolds a decade after a mysterious explosion on the same island, an event that marked the beginning of a new era in the Dangaioh legend. A young girl, the sole witness to a strange light in the sky, may hold the key to the survival of the human race.",
