    "text": "Urano Motosu is an avid booklover and aspiring librarian whose life is tragically cut short in an earthquake. As she passes, Urano wishes to be reborn in a world where she can be surrounded by books. Her wish comes true as she awakens as Myne, the daughter of a poor soldier in a medieval land with scarce literacy. Though initially excited to dive into this new magical world, Myne quickly discovers the stark lack of books due to prohibitive costs and exclusive ownership by nobles. Undeterred in her bibliophilia, Myne resolves to make her own books if none exist. Despite her sickly body and humble status, she retains all her passion and knowledge from her past life. Myne embarks on a quest not just to read, but increase access to books in this new world. Though she faces barriers from rigid social structures and limited resources, her wit and willpower know no bounds when it comes to realizing her dreams. Myne takes fate into her own hands to bring the written word to the masses, one page at a time. Full of resourcefulness and bibliophile charm, Myne's journey to become a librarian against all odds promises laughs, tears, and plenty of books for viewers. For fellow booklovers, this anime delivers an authentic and uplifting fantasy.",
