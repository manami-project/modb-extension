  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set 20 years before the events of \"Youths and the Golden Coffin,\" this anime follows Baili Dongjun, who later becomes the world's top swordsman. As the beloved only grandson of Marquis Zhenxi, Dongjun surprisingly lacks interest in martial arts. Instead, his passion lies in brewing baijiu liquor. After 10 years perfecting his craft, Dongjun steals a land deed and travels to Chaisang City to open his own tavern. However, Dongjun finds his street already occupied by villains. As the only young man serious about running a liquor business, Dongjun unintentionally gets caught between two feuding families. He befriends fellow outcasts - a wandering vagabond named Sikong Changfeng and Lei Mengsha, who rushed from Tianqi City. Grateful for their kinship, Dongjun resolves to help Mengsha rescue his sworn brother Gu Jianmen, the Young Master Lingyun, imprisoned in Marquis Zhenxi's manor. This coming-of-age story transpires in an era overflowing with rising young talents. We encounter future legends like Scholarly Sword Deity Xie Xuan, Raging Sword Deity Yan Zhantian, and Solitude Sword Deity Luo Qingyang when they are still unknowns, destined for greatness.",
