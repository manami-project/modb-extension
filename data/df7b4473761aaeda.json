The mysterious organization BioNet seeks world domination through dangerous technology, forcing GGG into battle once more. However, a shocking betrayal throws GGG into chaos when their former ally Mamoru joins a powerful new alien force called the Eleven Kings of Sol. This force launches devastating attacks on GGG bases worldwide, stealing components crucial to GGG's defense systems. Now exiled from Earth, GGG must travel across the stars to confront the Eleven Kings directly. With the stakes higher than ever, they race to unlock the secrets behind Mamoru's defection and defeat these aliens before their terrifying plans can threaten the entire universe. Joined by new allies like the French Chasseur division and former BioNet cyborg Renais, GGG gears up for battles that will test the limits of their technology and resolve. More than just the fate of Earth hangs in the balance this time.",
