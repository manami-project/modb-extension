    "text": "Regular ly dismissed as a failure, Arata Kaizaki, at 27, finds himself unemployed and navigating through life without purpose after leaving his first job. When he encounters the enigmatic Ryou Yoake from the ReLife Research Institute, Arata's mundane life takes a drastic turn. Offered a peculiar pill that promises to transform his appearance to that of a 17-year-old, Arata becomes a participant in a year-long experiment. As he re-enters high school, he believes his previous life experiences will give him an edge, but he quickly learns that the challenges he faces are far greater than anticipated. Struggling to adapt to new school policies and striving to correct past mistakes, Arata embarks on a journey of self-discovery, forming connections with fellow classmates along the way. Unbeknownst to him, Ryou closely monitors his every move, adding an unexpected layer of complexity to Arata's life.",
