  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hagino Yuzuru, an average student at Houjou Academy, finds herself entangled in a world of privilege and power when she becomes a 'Honey' to one of the elite Kuge course students, Renge Kai. The Kuge course, a special program for the affluent, pairs its students with 'Honeys' from the regular course, who must assist their 'Masters' until graduation in exchange for full tuition coverage. Yuzuru, struggling financially, sees this as an opportunity she can't refuse, despite the potential consequences. However, Kai, known for his sadistic tendencies and womanizing behavior, proves to be a challenging master. As Yuzuru navigates through weekly master-honey basketball competitions, rival masters vying for her service, and Kai's unpredictable whims, she must decide if she can endure the tumultuous life of a Honey or risk expulsion by quitting. Will Yuzuru manage to survive in this world of wealth and power, or will she crumble under the pressure? Only time will tell.",
