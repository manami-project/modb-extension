  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jashin-chan, a devil from Hell, makes a dramatic return to Earth after supposedly being lost in space. Her goal remains unchanged - to kill Yurine in order to regain entry to Hell. However, Yurine and her friends have other plans and drag Jashin-chan along on a beach vacation instead. Reluctantly going along, Jashin-chan finds her murder plans postponed as she spends the day swimming, eating shaved ice, and battling a giant Kraken monster with the very people she intends to kill. Though the beach trip seems fun at first, danger still lurks as the Kraken interrupts the group's relaxing barbecue. Will Jashin-chan ever be able to carry out her diabolical plans? Or is she doomed to keep getting entangled in zany adventures with Yurine and friends? One thing's for certain - with this wacky group, there's never a dull moment!",
