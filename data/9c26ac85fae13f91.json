    "text": "My thical creature Jashin-chan makes a spectacular comeback from her space journey in an extra episode of \"Dropkick on My Devil!\" as demanded by her fans. Instead of her usual mission to eliminate Yurine Hanazono, she finds herself joining Yurine and their friends - Medusa, Pekola, Minos, Yusa, Koji, and Peru-chan - for a beach day filled with swimsuits, ocean swims, and shaved ice. However, this leisurely day takes a turn when a colossal sea monster, the Kraken, emerges to disrupt their fun. The final battle of the season appears to be at hand, but little do they know, the true fight is yet to come.",
