    "text": "System:\n\nIn a war-torn region of the Southeast Asian Union, Shinya Kougami, a lone wanderer, crosses paths with a paramilitary commander, Guillermo Garcia, who seeks to unite local factions and restore peace. Despite his reluctance to join another mercenary group, Kougami finds himself drawn into the conflict when he saves a group of refugees from an armed guerrilla ambush. Among the survivors is Tenzing Wangchuck, a half-Japanese, half-Tibetan girl, who seeks vengeance against the warlord responsible for her family's murder. Impressed by Kougami's combat skills, she begs him to teach her how to fight. Haunted by his own past and the consequences of taking a life, Kougami grapples with whether to train her. As they both confront their desires for revenge, they must face the harsh reality of a world from which there is no turning back. This is the third film, 'Case.3 Onshuu no Kanata ni' (On the Other Side of Love and Hate), featuring Shinya Kougami.",
