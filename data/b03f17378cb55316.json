    "text": "After wandering away from Japan and the watchful eye of the Sibyl System, Shinya Kougami finds himself in a war-torn South Asian nation. While initially hoping to avoid further conflict, Kougami's plans are disrupted when he rescues a busload of Tibetan refugees under attack by armed guerrillas. Among them is Tenzing, a young half-Japanese, half-Tibetan girl seeking revenge against the warlord who murdered her family. Though wary of training another avenger, Kougami sees his own haunting past reflected in Tenzing's eyes. As teacher and student gaze upon a violent world offering no escape, they must decide whether to pursue justice or vengeance while balancing on the razor's edge between love and hate.",
