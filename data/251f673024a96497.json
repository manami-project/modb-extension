  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It has been 500 years since terrifying beasts invaded the world, wiping out the human race and forcing the surviving races to flee to floating islands in the sky. Among them is Willem, the last living human, who awakens from centuries trapped in ice to find himself utterly alone. In this new world, young Leprechaun girls have the ability to wield potent weapons that can fend off beast attacks. Willem unexpectedly finds purpose when he takes a job caring for these battle-ready girls. Though once a great warrior, he now anxiously waits at home, hoping for the safe return of his makeshift family from clashes with the beasts that destroyed his people. Bound by affection and their shared losses, Willem and the Leprechaun girls form an unlikely connection. He becomes a father figure devoted to their wellbeing, while also helping them understand the value of lives too often spent as disposable weapons. Together, they discover the meaning of family and what is truly worth protecting in their fragile world.",
