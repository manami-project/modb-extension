  "synopsis": {
    "text": "He, the last human alive, Willem Kmetsch, awakens from a long slumber to find himself in a world where terrifying beasts have driven the surviving races to floating islands in the sky. The only weapons capable of fighting these creatures are ancient swords, wielded by young girls of the Leprechaun race. Willem, once a warrior, now finds solace in odd jobs, until he accepts a position as an Enchanted Weapons Technician. Little did he know that these 'weapons' are actually a group of young Leprechauns, who he soon becomes a caretaker for. As he fosters a familial bond with these girls, Willem finds himself in a new role, anxiously waiting for his loved ones to return from battle. This is a poignant tale of a man who once fought on the frontlines, now finding purpose in protecting and nurturing those who fight in his place.",
