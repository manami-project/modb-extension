  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aquarion, the colossal mechanical Angel, once subdued the Shadow Angels who preyed on humans for their vital energy. The rebellious Apollonius, enamored with the human Seliane, joined forces with Scorpius to confine the Angels in an icy prison. However, a tragic turn of events led to Apollonius's demise at the hands of the corrupted Scorpius, resulting in global devastation.\n\nFast forward 12,000 years, the Angels have reemerged, and the international organization DEAVA is struggling to contain them using replicas of Aquarion. In a race against time, DEAVA trains young potential pilots, believed to be the reincarnations of Apollonius, Seliane, and Scorpius. The fate of humanity hinges on these young individuals, raising the question: Will they be the beacon of hope or will history repeat itself in a catastrophic betrayal?\n\nThis movie is an alternative rendition of the TV series, featuring the edited 2007 OVAs to enhance plot progression, and an additional segment reminiscent of a TV episode, where the characters delve into the study of flowers. The plot deviates from the TV series, notably with Sirius's early death, Apollo's distinct childhood, and a heightened emphasis on the events of 12,000 years ago, including Apollonius's death and Reika's previous incarnation's involvement.",
