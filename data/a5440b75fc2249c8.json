  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's crunch time for Jotaro Kujo and his intrepid crew as they reach Egypt in their relentless pursuit of the formidable vampire, DIO. With the clock ticking, they must confront DIO's deadliest disciples yet: the nine Egyptian God Stand users, dispatched to annihilate them. Along the way, they reluctantly gain a new ally in Iggy, a dog with the Stand, The Fool. As they traverse the Egyptian landscape, their mission remains clear: find DIO, defeat his powerful Stand, The World, and put an end to the century-long terror inflicted on the Joestar family. The stakes are high, and time is running out, as Jotaro's mother's life hangs in the balance, ensnared by DIO's curse. Will they triumph, or will DIO's reign of terror continue unabated?",
