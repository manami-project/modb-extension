  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tower of God centers around Twenty-Fifth Bam, a boy who has spent most of his life trapped beneath a vast and mysterious Tower. His only companion is his close friend Rachel. When Rachel enters the Tower, Bam manages to open its doors as well and faces dangerous tests on each floor as he tries to find Rachel. The Tower summons chosen people called \"Regulars\" and promises to grant their deepest desires if they reach the top. However, the ascent up the Tower's floors is perilous, filled with deadly trials. The Tower also attracts powerful \"Irregulars\" like Bam who can enter by their own free will. Irregulars are feared by many for the chaos they bring. As Bam climbs the Tower, he enters a world of fierce competitors, untrustworthy rivals, and terrifying monsters. He vows to follow Rachel no matter the cost, but his path leads him into great peril. Yet the promise of reuniting with Rachel and the Tower's ability to grant miracles continue to drive Bam ever upwards. In the end, this is a tale of two individuals - Rachel, the girl who climbed the Tower to see the stars, and Bam, the boy who needed nothing but her.",
