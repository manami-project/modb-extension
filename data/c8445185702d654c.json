    "text": "Few are privy to the secret life of Ureshiko Asaba, a seemingly ordinary 26-year-old married woman who moonlights as the magical guardian 'Agnes' of her quaint town. When she's not busy managing her boarding house, Ureshiko is tasked with protecting her town from otherworldly threats as Agnes, a role appointed by the magical realm. However, her world turns upside down when she encounters Sayaka Kurenai, also known as 'Cruje', who has been sent to replace her. Agnes becomes reluctant to relinquish her position, as she knows the sinister truth behind Cruje's mission: to erase the town and its inhabitants to pave the way for a new one.\n\nAs if this weren't complicated enough, Ureshiko finds herself navigating a labyrinth of emotions, grappling with the increasing distance between her and her husband, Tamotsu. Meanwhile, her heart is drawn to the enigmatic Tatsumi Kagura, a new tenant in her boarding house. Yet, Ureshiko is acutely aware of the rule that binds her: a single kiss with a mortal man will strip her of her magical powers forever.\n\nIn this enchanting tale of love, duty, and sacrifice, Ureshiko Asaba must balance her responsibilities as a magical guardian with her burgeoning feelings for Tatsumi, all while deciding the fate of her beloved town. Will she find a way to save her town and follow her heart without compromising her powers? Only time will tell in this captivating narrative that weaves magic and romance into the fabric of everyday life.",
