  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime Girls & Panzer centers around high school girls who participate in an unusual extracurricular activity - tank warfare. To commemorate the release of a 5.1 surround sound Blu-ray box set collecting the TV series and OVAs, the production company Bandai Namco created a special 30-minute OVA episode titled Akiyama Yukari's Tank Course 'Extra'. This OVA follows the tank-obsessed schoolgirl Akiyama Yukari as she shares her extensive knowledge of tanks and armored warfare vehicles. A 7-minute preview version with watermarks was posted on Bandai Namco's YouTube channel on September 29th, 2018 to promote the upcoming Blu-ray box set and OVA episode. The full version without watermarks will be included in the Blu-ray box set scheduled for release on December 21st, 2018. Fans of the eccentric Yukari and her endless trivia about tanks both real and fictional will find this release to be an enjoyable treat. For newcomers, it also serves as a fun introduction to the unique appeal of Girls & Panzer.",
