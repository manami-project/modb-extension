    "text": "Vinland Saga follows Thorfinn, a young Viking warrior seeking vengeance against Askeladd, the man who killed Thorfinn's father. After his father's death, Thorfinn joins Askeladd's band of mercenaries, waiting for a chance to challenge him to an honorable duel. The story is set in 11th century England during the war between England and Denmark over the English crown. Askeladd and his Viking mercenaries are caught in the middle of this war, fighting for whoever will pay them more. Though a skilled fighter, Thorfinn struggles with his inner hatred and the violence surrounding him. Through his ordeals across the battlefields of England, Thorfinn holds onto his dreams of Vinland â€“ a mythical land to the west that his father told him about. A fertile land without war or slavery. It represents Thorfinn's hopes for a peaceful paradise away from the endless violence in which he finds himself trapped. As Thorfinn pursues vengeance amidst war, the story explores the futility of violence and the possibility of breaking free from cycles of hatred. Thorfinn must decide if peace or more bloodshed awaits him after he confronts Askeladd.",
