    "text": "Hyakki Empire, a ruthless militaristic faction led by the formidable Emperor Burai, has emerged as a new threat to Earth after the fall of the Dinosaur Empire in the original Getter Robo series. Dr. Saotome, the genius inventor behind Getter Robo, anticipates this menacing danger and prepares a more advanced robot, Getter Robo G, to combat the looming evil.\n\nWith Musashi Tomoe no longer in the picture, Dr. Saotome seeks a new pilot to join Ryo and Hayato in operating the powerful Getter Robo G. Enter Benkei Kuruma, a talented baseball player who steps up to the plate to fill the vacant position.\n\nThe Hyakki Empire, inspired by Japanese mythology's oni demons, aims to dominate the world and seize the Getter Ray technology. To counter this, Dr. Saotome constructs a new base and equips Getter Robo G with three getter-machines: Dragon (red), Ryger (blue), and Poseidon (yellow).\n\nAs the world teeters on the brink of chaos, Ryo, Hayato, and Benkei must unite to pilot Getter Robo G and thwart Emperor Burai's sinister ambitions. Will they succeed in protecting Earth from this new menace, or will the Hyakki Empire claim victory in its quest for global conquest? Join the new Getter Robo team and witness their epic battles in this thrilling sequel!",
