    "text": "Yukami Makoto is a high school boy with a passion for visiting hot springs. To commemorate his 100th hot spring visit, he travels to Miyama-kan, a lovely inn run by four friends - Tokura, Akino, Tsutsuji, and Mitomo. Unbeknownst to Makoto, Miyama-kan is also home to Yuri, a goddess who uses her magical powers to care for the hot springs. When Makoto accidentally spies Yuri using her powers, he becomes enamored by her beauty. In a strange twist of fate, he gains Yuri's abilities, becoming a hot spring deity himself. As a result, Makoto begins working at Miyama-kan alongside the four hostesses and goddess Yuri. This serendipitous event sparks a budding romance between Makoto and the Miyama-kan girls. Will love bloom amidst the steamy waters of the hot springs? Or will complications arise from Makoto's newfound duties as a deity? The soothing warmth of the springs cultivates relationships in this mystical slice-of-life tale.",
