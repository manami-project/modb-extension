  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Her ordinary life as a middle school student abruptly disrupted, Shouko finds herself thrust into a world of cosmic conflict and divine intervention. Five years after her beloved sister, Kyouko, left for foreign lands, Shouko learns the truth: Kyouko was not merely studying abroad, but serving as a Bronze Saint in the celestial army of Athena, the goddess of war.\n\nNow, as a malevolent comet hurtles towards Earth, harbinger of the vengeful goddess Eris, Shouko is marked as the next target. With her sister's fate hanging in the balance, Shouko must take up the mantle of Bronze Saint in her stead. Faced with perilous training under a notorious mentor, Shouko must grow stronger and prepare for the impending galactic war.\n\nSet in the aftermath of the Sanctuary arc from the original Saint Seiya manga, this new series follows Shouko and her all-woman team of Zodiac-powered warriors. As they navigate their destinies, they must protect Athena from the sinister machinations of Eris and her Dryad servants. In this high-stakes battle, their courage, strength, and compassion will be their greatest weapons.",
