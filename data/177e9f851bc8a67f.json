  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Only a handful of resilient human factions remain in the year 2065, clinging to survival in the face of the Aragami, a formidable race of monsters with an insatiable hunger for destruction. Conventional weaponry proves futile against these beasts, forcing humanity to adapt by crafting arms from the same material that composes the Aragami themselves - Oracle Cells. Despite this innovation, the Aragami's divine ability to evolve renders even these weapons less effective over time.\n\nIn a desperate bid to stave off the brink of extinction, remnants of global governments enlist the aid of the Fenrir Far East Branch, an elite military task force controlling the remnants of Japan. Among their ranks are the God Eaters, mighty warriors wielding state-of-the-art weapons known as God Arcs, capable of penetrating the Aragami's defenses and obliterating their cores.\n\nOur story follows three such God Eaters, including Souma, a key protagonist in the subsequent events of the video game this tale precedes. Their mission: infiltrate a heavily fortified Aragami stronghold and detonate a nuclear reactor, sacrificing themselves in a last-ditch effort to eradicate the monstrous threat and safeguard humanity's future. The fate of mankind rests in the hands of these brave few, as they embark on a perilous journey that may very well be their last.",
