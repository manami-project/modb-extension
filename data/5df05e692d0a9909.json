    "text": "Set in the vibrant Tokyo district of Geso, an innovative app called 'AICis' has taken the city's schools by storm. The app grants its users extraordinary abilities, but the power often corrupts, leading to a surge in violence and chaos as students exploit their newfound supernatural skills for personal gain. Amidst this turmoil, a dedicated group of student detectives rises, committed to solving these psychic-induced cases and restoring balance to their city. This is their story of courage, justice, and the fight against power misused.",
