  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in Geso District, a school city in Tokyo, the anime follows the rise of a popular psychic app called AICis. By installing AICis, students gain supernatural abilities, which unfortunately many use to selfishly pursue their interests at the expense of others. This leads to outbreaks of violence and chaos across Geso's schools. Amidst the mayhem, the story focuses on a group of student detectives who take on cases involving AICis psychic incidents. Using their wits and insight, they aim to solve these cases and restore order before things spiral out of control. However, with the app's popularity growing and more students unlocking powers, the detectives face an increasingly complex challenge. Balancing high school life with their secret detective work, this team races against time to contain Geso's psychic epidemic. Will they uncover the truth behind AICis and its dangerous gifts? Or will selfish ambition and supernatural power tear their community apart?",
