    "text": "Ozma, a distant planet, becomes the focus of humanity's ambition in the 21st century as Earth dwellers embark on a daring mission to colonize the cosmos. Selected from a pool of volunteers, two young couples, including Adam and Hannah, willingly participate in the 'Space Seeding Plan'. Their genetic material, along with that of the Robinson family, is preserved aboard a spacecraft destined for Ozma.\n\nUtilizing advanced technology, a community flourishes within the confines of the sleeper ship during its 375-year voyage. Upon reaching Ozma, the terraformed planet is settled, marking a significant milestone in mankind's exploration of space.\n\nAs the story unfolds, we delve into the possibilities and challenges that arise when humans take their first steps into the great unknown. Inspired by Yukinobu Hoshino's 1984 manga and shot in 'Super Perspective Technique', this captivating anime invites viewers to join the adventure and experience the triumphs and tribulations of space colonization.",
