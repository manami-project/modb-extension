  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cinque is summoned back to the magical kingdom of Flonyard, three months after his previous adventure there. This time, he brings along his cousin Nanami and childhood friend Rebecca. Upon arriving in Flonyard, they find themselves caught in the middle of an escalating three-way conflict between the lion-themed Galette Lion Territory ruled by Leonmitchelli, the squirrel-like Principality of Pastillage governed by Princess Couvert, and Cinque's ally - the dog-themed Biscotti Republic led by Millhiore. Both Nanami and Rebecca are quickly recruited as Heroes by Leonmitchelli and Couvert respectively, gaining magical weapons and becoming empowered. Despite being cousins, Nanami and Cinque end up as rivals, supporting opposing factions. Rebecca too finds herself facing off against Cinque on the battlefield. With the addition of these two talented new Heroes, the already complex political situation in Flonyard grows even more turbulent. As war games and athletic competitions ensue between the three factions, Cinque must help Princess Millhiore and the Biscotti Republic prevail against their two newly strengthened adversaries.",
