    "text": "After years of prestige and renown for martial arts, Hakuo Academy now faces an imminent decline due to the underhanded tactics employed by its rival, Seishikan. In an effort to preserve its legacy, Hakuo Academy enlists the help of the legendary Fuma Clan, a group of ninjas with extraordinary abilities. The clan sends Kojiro, a skilled ninja, to protect the academy from the Yasha Clan, a rival ninja group working for Seishikan. Kojiro's mission becomes even more critical when he learns that the strongest enemy he must face is Asuka Musashi, who is fighting for his ailing younger sister. As the two rival clans clash on the school grounds, Kojiro must defend Hakuo Academy and put an end to Seishikan's aggression once and for all.",
