    "text": "Harunobu Madarame, a sophomore student, shatters the false pride of Kanji Sasahara, a college freshman, during his first visit to Genshiken, the Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture. Despite his initial denial of being an otaku, Sasahara finds himself drawn to the club's activities, which include visiting doujin shops, attending anime festivals, and discussing manga, anime, and gaming. As he befriends club members like Makoto Kousaka, a hardcore otaku with good looks, and Kousaka's girlfriend, Saki Kasukabe, who is not an otaku, Sasahara begins to embrace his otaku nature. With the help of his new friends, Sasahara navigates the world of otaku culture and finds a place where he truly belongs. Join Sasahara and the rest of Genshiken as they explore the fascinating and sometimes bizarre world of modern visual culture.",
