  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tomie Kawakami is an alluring and mysterious high school student with long, dark hair and a distinctive beauty mark. Though popular among her male classmates, Tomie has a sinister ability to bring out obsession and violence in the men who fall for her charms. Time and again, spurned lovers end up killing Tomie in fits of rage and jealousy - dismembering her body or trying desperately to get rid of her for good. But she always returns, as beautiful and bewitching as ever, driven by a cruel compulsion to seduce and destroy. When Tomie's severed body parts are found scattered around school, her classmates are shaken to the core. The grisly murder dominates gossip and rumors in the aftermath. Just as students are struggling to process the events, their collective disbelief turns to horror when Tomie inexplicably reappears smiling sweetly in the classroom doorway, seemingly unharmed. This resurrection sparks fascination and fear. Some students wonder if she is a ghost or immortal demon. Others become paranoid - could anyone truly kill her and end her cycle of violence? Or will Tomie continue luring men to their doom, only to reemerge more vengeful and deadly than before? Her mystifying existence leaves the student body grappling with secrets, dread, and the limits of human mortality.",
