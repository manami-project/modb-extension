    "text": "Never released for home viewing, \"Sea Cat\" is a captivating, educational short film that delves into the dangers of nuclear warfare. Produced by Oh! Productions and funded by the Kishiwada City Teachers' Union, this rare gem follows the heartwarming tale of an orphaned cat who finds solace and a new life under the sea, nurtured by a loving sea otter. Their peaceful existence takes a dramatic turn when they stumble upon a seemingly menacing sea creature, which is, in fact, a man-made nuclear submarine. This poignant story, told through the lives of anthropomorphic animals, serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of nuclear disarmament. Recently preserved by Kineko Films, \"Sea Cat\" is now accessible to a wider audience, inviting viewers to explore its timeless message wrapped in a charming narrative.",
