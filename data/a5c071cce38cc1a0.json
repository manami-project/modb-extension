  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During the Cold War, Japan and the United States jointly developed an advanced nuclear submarine named Seabat. On its maiden voyage under an American flag and Japanese crew, Captain Kaieda unexpectedly veers the submarine off course into the Pacific. Kaieda renames the vessel Yamato and shockingly declares it an independent nation, sparking an international incident. The defiant act causes outrage in both American and Japanese leadership. As the countries scramble to reclaim or destroy the rogue submarine, tensions rapidly escalate to the brink of war. Yamato's crew find themselves isolated at sea, their fate hanging in the balance as events spiral beyond their control. This high-stakes thriller examines the complex relations between global superpowers through the lens of mutiny on a covert military vessel. Yamato's declaration of sovereignty sets off a dangerous showdown driven by nationalism and pride on all sides. Will war erupt over this renegade submarine crew's radical act of independence?",
