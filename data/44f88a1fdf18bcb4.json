  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fifteen children escape from Grace Field House, a false paradise where they are being raised as food for demons. Hoping for freedom, they instead encounter a beautiful yet brutal outside world filled with unfamiliar threats. Guided by cryptic messages left by \"William Minerva\", the children strive to find sanctuary while fighting to survive and evade their demonic pursuers. Against all odds, Emma, Ray and their makeshift family cling to hope, refusing to abandon their quest or each other. But with limited time and resources, they face agonizing choices. Not all humans or demons are what they seem either, blurring the lines between friend and foe. As the children traverse an unpredictable world to find a place they can truly call home before their siblings at Grace Field House are shipped off, their arduous battle for freedom has only just begun.",
