  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As humanity ventures into the 21st century, Mars, the red planet, has been transformed into a thriving colony. But the joy of exploration is short-lived as an enigmatic alien race known as 'The Gods' emerges, intent on halting human expansion. A brutal war ensues, with Mars becoming the ultimate battleground. As advanced human warfare, including hyper-sophisticated aircraft and colossal desert battleships, clashes with the Gods' formidable weaponry, hope seems to dwindle.\n\nThe Gods' arsenal includes 'Hell,' a stealth carrier of unparalleled destruction, and a sinister mind-control plague that silently corrupts even the most devoted soldiers, turning them into traitors. As this insidious disease spreads, humanity finds itself on the brink of despair.\n\nIn this dire hour, Captain Akuh and his crew aboard the Battleship Aoba emerge as humanity's last beacon of hope. Tasked with a classified mission, they must destroy Hell and deliver a crushing blow to the alien forces. But as Akuh's loved one begins to exhibit the first signs of alien subversion, the stakes become personal. Will Akuh triumph against the odds and secure humanity's future among the stars? The fate of mankind rests in his hands.",
