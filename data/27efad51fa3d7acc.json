The cause lies in anomalous spacetime regions called \"Singularities\" that have begun appearing across history. To resolve this threat, Chaldea dispatches their last remaining Master, Ritsuka Fujimaru, and his Demi-Servant partner, Mash Kyrielight, on a mission dubbed the \"Grand Order.\" By traveling to the past Singularities and resolving the abnormalities, they hope to restore proper human history and avert mankind's demise. Their seventh and final destination is Ancient Mesopotamia, 2655 B.C. Once a prosperous land ruled by King Gilgamesh, Babylonia now faces invasion by three goddesses and their army of Demonic Beasts.
