    "text": "Kirari Tsukishima is a 14-year-old girl obsessed with food who has no interest in idols or entertainment. One day while saving a turtle stuck in a tree, she meets Seiji, a gentle boy who gives her a ticket to a concert by popular idol group SHIPS. There she discovers Seiji and another boy named Hiroto are actually members of SHIPS. Hiroto warns Kirari that she and Seiji live in different worlds - he is a famous idol while she is an average student. Determined to be with Seiji, Kirari declares she will become an idol too. As Kirari enters the idol world with the help of Seiji, Hiroto, her cat mascot Naa-san and her family and friends, she realizes being an idol is filled with fierce competition, hard work and rivals. Kirari perseveres through the challenges, pursuing both her newfound love and idol career, learning that being popular isn't all fun and games.",
