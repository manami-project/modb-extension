    "text": "They call themselves 'Sphinx' - two enigmatic boys who have plunged an alternate-reality Tokyo into chaos with a series of audacious terrorist attacks. Their first strike, a devastating bombing, jolts the city from its complacency, leaving the authorities scrambling for answers. The only clue to their identity is a series of cryptic videos uploaded online, which spark widespread panic and paranoia among the populace.\n\nAs the police grapple with the fallout, Detective Kenjirou Shibazaki finds himself entangled in a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse with the elusive perpetrators. Meanwhile, a chance encounter draws Lisa Mishima, a disillusioned teenage girl, into the eye of the storm. Caught in the crossfire between Sphinx and the law, she sees a glimmer of hope for escape from her mundane existence.\n\nThe duo known as Nine and Twelve should not exist, yet they orchestrate their destructive acts with chilling precision, leaving the authorities powerless to stop them. As the city teeters on the brink of collapse, the stakes grow ever higher. What is the true motive behind Sphinx's reign of terror, and what dark secrets lie buried in their past? Embark on a thrilling journey to unravel the mystery in Zankyou no Terror.",
