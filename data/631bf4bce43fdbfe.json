  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Bucky is an ambitious young boy living in the First World, one of the twelve worlds in the mysterious Parallel Planet. He dreams of conquering all twelve worlds and becoming their ruler. The twelve worlds coexist peacefully under the protection of the Princess in the Needle Tower of the Zero World. When the Princess suddenly falls asleep, the balance across the worlds crumbles. Monsters break free and begin attacking humans. The Great Children, powerful troubleshooters tasked with maintaining harmony, struggle to contain the chaos. Bucky crosses paths with Spaak, the strongest Great Child, who sees potential in the boy and makes him his successor. Though reckless at first, Bucky matures as he travels across the worlds, battling guardians and meeting fellow Great Children like Kai and Pinky. They investigate an evil power from another dimension that is controlling the rampaging monsters. To restore order in the twelve worlds, Bucky and his companions must defeat the monsters, wake the Princess from her deep slumber, and journey to the Needle Tower at the center of Parallel Planet.",
