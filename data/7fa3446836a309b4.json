    "text": "Maidens of Rozen, lifelike dolls with the ability to battle each other, find themselves entangled in a complex web of rivalry and misunderstanding. Jun Sakurada, who coexists with these dolls, attempts to gift a brooch to Shinku, the fifth doll. However, Shinku adamantly refuses the present, leaving Jun bewildered. Souseiseki, the fourth doll, steps in to clarify Shinku's peculiar behavior by recounting a centuries-old tale of the Rozen Maidens' first encounter.\n\nIn the heart of 19th century London, the story unfolds with the birth of Suigintou, the first Rozen Maiden doll. Born into a cruel and heartbreaking world, Suigintou's past is riddled with hardships and misconceptions that eventually lead to a longstanding rivalry with Shinku. Fueled by unbridled hatred, Suigintou's animosity towards Shinku transcends time, shaping their tumultuous relationship.\n\nAs Jun delves deeper into the Rozen Maidens' past, he discovers the origin of Shinku and Suigintou's mutual hatred, as well as the reason behind Shinku's refusal to accept his gift. This poignant tale, filled with surprising revelations, provides a fresh perspective on the Rozen Maidens' world and the secrets they harbor.",
