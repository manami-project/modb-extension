  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keiji Nakazawa's poignant tale, Barefoot Gen, unfolds in the war-ravaged city of Hiroshima during the summer of 1945. The story revolves around the resilient six-year-old Gen, who has known nothing but the harsh realities of war. Despite the constant struggle for survival, Gen and his family find solace in their unity and shared hope for a peaceful future.\n\nAs the war between Japan and the United States intensifies, Hiroshima remains an unlikely haven, spared from the widespread bombings that have devastated other Japanese cities. Yet, life is far from easy; food scarcity and severe malnutrition threaten the well-being of Gen's pregnant mother, forcing him and his younger brother, Shinji, to take on responsibilities beyond their tender years.\n\nThe family's optimism and perseverance are abruptly shattered on August 6, 1945, when the United States drops the atomic bomb, 'Little Boy,' on Hiroshima. The catastrophic event forever alters the course of their lives and the fate of Japan. Amidst the unimaginable horrors that follow, Gen's unyielding spirit and youthful innocence emerge as beacons of hope for those around him, offering a glimpse of resilience in the face of unparalleled devastation.",
