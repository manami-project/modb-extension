    "text": "The story follows Yuu Kusaka, a once idealistic child who pledged to protect the weak and uphold justice. However, a tragic event involving the death of a close friend leaves him disillusioned, causing him to use his mysterious powers for personal gain instead. His life takes a drastic turn when he's attacked by a classmate with similar abilities and is saved by a mysterious girl, Eimu Yoake, who reveals the source of his powers: an Ayakashi, a parasitic entity that grants special abilities at the cost of the host's life force.\n\nAs Yuu grapples with the reality of his Ayakashi, he's drawn into a dangerous world where others with similar powers threaten not only him but also those he cares about. The truth behind his friend's death becomes intertwined with his new reality, forcing him to confront his past and the Ayakashi within him. Will Yuu be able to uphold his childhood vow and use his powers for good, or will he succumb to the allure of power and risk losing his life to the Ayakashi? This thrilling anime, adapted from a 2005 superhuman battle action visual novel game, promises a relentless battle and a captivating journey of self-discovery.",
