  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Can't resist a chase after a dragonfly, Nyanko-sensei, also known as Madara, finds himself separated from his temporary owner, Takashi Natsume. In his wandering, he encounters two young children who have lost their way during their first errand for their mother. With Natsume searching for him, Nyanko-sensei takes on the unexpected responsibility of protecting these curious and playful kids. However, the forest is teeming with ravenous youkai, and even for a powerful youkai like Nyanko-sensei, handling children proves to be an exhausting task. Can he guide them to safety and help them complete their errand while maintaining his own sanity? This original animated story was first available as a bonus mail-order DVD for readers of LaLa's August, October, and September 2013 issues and later aired as a special in the broadcast schedule of Natsume Yuujinchou Go on November 16, 2016.",
