  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Nyanko-sensei, a powerful spirit in the form of a cat, gets separated from his temporary owner Takashi Natsume while chasing a dragonfly. He soon crosses paths with two young children who are lost while running an errand for their mother. Although impatient and eager to return to Natsume, Nyanko-sensei realizes the children are in danger from hungry spirits lurking in the forest. Reluctantly, he decides to escort them to safety. However, keeping the overly curious and playful children safe proves challenging for the cunning but easily exhausted Nyanko-sensei. As Natsume searches for his missing companion, Nyanko-sensei has his paws full trying to figure out the children's mysterious errand while protecting them from supernatural threats. Will he be able to help the children complete their task and make it back to Natsume with his sanity intact? Originally released as a bonus story for LaLa magazine readers, this amusing tale of an unlikely spirit guide shepherding lost children was later aired as a special episode of Natsume Yuujinchou Go.",
