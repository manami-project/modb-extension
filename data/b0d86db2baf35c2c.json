    "text": "Hisone Amakasu is a rookie soldier stationed at the Gifu Airbase of Japan's Air Self-Defense Force. Though well-meaning, she struggles with unintentionally hurting people's feelings. Seeking distance from others, Hisone joins the military, only to fatefully encounter the base's hidden secret - a transforming dragon warplane called the Organic Transformed Flyer (OTF). After being swallowed and released by the OTF, Hisone learns she has been chosen as its next pilot. Bound together, Hisone and her dragon, nicknamed Masotan, must learn to fly as one. Now, along with fellow cadet pilots, Hisone works to overcome self-doubt in order to understand her dragon and unlock its mysterious, world-altering power. They say dragons hold the key to the future. As she soars into the skies with Masotan, Hisone's destiny as a Dragon Pilot takes flight.",
