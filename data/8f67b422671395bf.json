    "text": "The anime film \"Ni no Kuni\" follows three high school friends - Yuu, Haru, and Kotona - whose lives are turned upside down when Kotona is mysteriously attacked one day. As Yuu and Haru rush to Kotona's aid, they suddenly find themselves transported to a parallel magical world called Ni no Kuni. In this new realm that resembles their own, Yuu and Haru encounter Asha, a princess bearing an uncanny resemblance to the injured Kotona. They soon realize that Kotona's life hangs in the balance in both worlds. To rescue her, they must make an impossible choice - sacrifice Asha's life in Ni no Kuni to save Kotona in their own world. Yuu grapples with this cruel decision, struggling between his affection for both Asha and his childhood friend Kotona. Meanwhile, Haru remains devoted to saving his girlfriend Kotona, no matter the cost to Asha. The two friends find their loyalty and convictions tested as they navigate between the two realms. Full of fantastical creatures and unexpected connections between parallel worlds, Ni no Kuni presents an imaginative adventure underlined by the inescapable bonds of friendship. Yuu and Haru's ultimate choice carries grave stakes, compelling them to confront the true meaning of sacrifice for those they care deeply about.",
