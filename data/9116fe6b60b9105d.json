  "synopsis": {
    "text": "What a journey it is for young Kayoko, a first-grader living in 1940s Japan, as she navigates the trials and tribulations of childhood amidst the backdrop of World War II. With a heart full of joy and a spirit that can't be tamed, Kayoko embraces life with her three older brothers, cherishing their playful escapades and the delightful schoolyard chants they share.\n\nAs her mother's pregnancy progresses, Kayoko eagerly anticipates becoming a big sister, even if the responsibilities remain somewhat hazy to her innocent mind. When the call for patriotism echoes through the land, Kayoko selflessly donates her beloved doll, understanding its potential to aid the war effort.\n\nAs the years pass, the once-distant war encroaches upon her life, casting a long shadow over her carefree existence. When the American bombings commence, Kayoko finds herself sent to the countryside to live with her aunt, a stark contrast to her familiar urban surroundings.\n\nWith the war now inescapable, Kayoko must confront the harsh realities that have befallen her family and her nation. As the end of the war approaches, Kayoko's resilience and spirit will be tested like never before, leaving her to wonder what the future may hold.",
