    "text": "Mysterious fiancés, unconventional family expansions, and a dash of the supernatural await Kobeni Yonomori on her seemingly ordinary 16th birthday. Thanks to an arrangement made by her late grandfather, Kobeni finds herself betrothed to Hakuya Mitsumine, a boy her age, who moves into her home along with his younger sister, Mashiro. As the newcomers settle in, Kobeni and her older sister, Benio, must navigate the complexities of their extended family life, which includes deciphering the siblings' peculiarities and explaining their sudden presence to friends.\n\nWhile trying to adjust to these unexpected changes, Kobeni uncovers extraordinary secrets about her new family members. From Mashiro's fascination with aliens and mysterious creatures to Hakuya's unsettling lack of emotion, it becomes clear that there's more to them than meets the eye. As Kobeni delves deeper into the enigma surrounding her fiancé and his sister, she must also confront the mysterious gap in her own memory. Join Kobeni on this unpredictable journey of love, family, and self-discovery in Mikakunin de Shinkoukei.",
