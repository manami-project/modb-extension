    "text": "Nearly 500 years ago, a bloody civil war erupted within the Inca Empire over control of a mystical weapon with the power to destroy the world. The losing side attempted to unleash this apocalyptic force, but ultimately failed. In present-day Japan, high school student Kyoji Miura discovers he is the reincarnation of an Inca warrior involved in that ancient conflict. His friend and kendo mentor Tate Masanari is revealed to be the reborn soul of Yawaru, the Inca commander who originally sought to wield the mystical weapon. Obsessed with fulfilling his centuries-old mission, Tate endeavors to locate and unleash the weapon's awesome destructive power once again. To save the modern world, Kyoji must uncover the secrets of his past life and defeat Tate in an epic showdown spanning centuries. Kyoji and his allies race against time on a globe-trotting quest to thwart Tateâ€™s terrifying agenda before the mystical Inca weapon can bring about the end of the world.",
