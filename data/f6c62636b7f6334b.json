Despite her lackluster performances and less-than-glamorous gigs, she remains undeterred, drawing inspiration from her successful classmate, Kokona, and the charismatic cross-dressing idol, Tsubasa. Komugi's life takes a dramatic turn when she crosses paths with a peculiar injured creature, Usa-P. In a heartwarming act of kindness, she tends to Usa-P's wounds, inadvertently unlocking a world of magic and transforming her into a Legendary Girl.\n\nNow, donning the mantle of a \"Magical Nurse,\" Komugi finds herself thrust into a whirlwind of battles against mysterious masked figures and rival magical girls. As she valiantly juggles her triple roles of a middle school student, an aspiring idol, and a magical warrior, Komugi's unwavering spirit is put to the test. Amidst the chaos and laughter, Komugi's journey unfolds, filled with dreams, friendships, and the relentless pursuit of her passions. Will she emerge victorious in this three-way battle and find the success she's always dreamt of? Only time will tell.",
