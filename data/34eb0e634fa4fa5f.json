    "text": "Japan, a decade after the Bubble War, is a stark contrast between the opulent and the impoverished, with Tokyo serving as a haven for the wealthy seeking indulgence. Amidst this backdrop, Tatsumi Saiga, a former war photographer, now seeks to expose the truth behind the elusive Roppongi Club, a secretive establishment catering to the privileged. The club is shrouded in mystery, with whispers of a young girl named Kagura, exploited and revered as a goddess, being its central figure. Upon infiltrating the club, Saiga's encounter with Kagura bestows him with a unique power: the ability to detonate objects through photography. With this newfound power, Saiga embarks on a solitary mission to unravel the enigmatic secrets of the Roppongi Club and save Kagura from her captors.",
