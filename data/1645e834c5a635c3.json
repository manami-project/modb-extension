  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an ordinary high school, a mysterious explosion suddenly occurs, killing an entire class of students. Their souls are transported to a fantasy world where they are reincarnated into new lives. While some are reborn as nobles or heroes, the unlucky protagonist finds herself reincarnated as a low-level spider monster inside a dangerous dungeon filled with threats. Though now one of the weakest creatures, the protagonist refuses to give up. Using her wits, positivity, and whatever abilities she gains, she confronts each challenge head-on in order to survive and grow stronger. It's an uphill battle as she fights against monsters many times her size, lays traps, and levels up within the RPG-like system of this new magical world. Through perseverance and adaptation, this unlikely hero works to evolve not just as a spider, but as a person. However, the risky dungeon environment means death lies around every corner. Will her determination be enough to overcome the odds against her very survival?",
