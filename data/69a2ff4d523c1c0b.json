  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Episode 1 and 2 of \"Ghiblies\" offer a delightful glimpse into the quirky and entertaining world of a fictional animation studio, inspired by the renowned Studio Ghibli. The first episode was initially aired as part of a TV special dedicated to Ghibli, while the second episode was screened in theaters alongside \"The Cat Returns.\"\n\nThe animation studio's name, spelled as ギブリ, is pronounced with a hard 'gi' sound, unlike the softer 'ji' sound in 'jigsaw' used for Ghibli. This charming series introduces us to the eccentric and talented individuals behind the studio, affectionately known as the Ghiblies.\n\nThrough a series of amusing and heartwarming vignettes, we delve into the personal and professional lives of the Ghiblies, revealing their hidden talents, inside jokes, and even their lunchtime dilemmas. From moments of laughter to shared memories of first love, we witness the unique camaraderie and creativity that make these individuals the driving force behind the revolutionary anime we know and love today. Prepare to be entertained and inspired by the extraordinary minds behind the studio that has forever changed the anime landscape.",
