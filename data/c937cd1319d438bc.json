    "text": "Asagaya Minoa, a fresh face at Sakaneko Private High School, finds herself thrust into the vibrant world of anime by her charismatic classmate, Kamiigusa Arisu. Together, they establish an 'anime research club', despite Minoa's initial lack of knowledge on the subject. As they delve deeper into anime discussions with fellow enthusiasts like Kouenji Miko and various upperclassmen, Minoa's fascination with anime begins to grow. Amidst the student council's persistent attempts to dismantle their club and the looming threat of an impending apocalypse, the group continues to explore and discuss anime, taking their passion from the club room to the bustling streets of Akiba, real-life 'sacred place' anime settings, and even the tranquil hot springs. Fueled by their shared love for anime, Minoa and her friends navigate through this unique journey, uncovering the magic and mystery that this world has to offer.",
