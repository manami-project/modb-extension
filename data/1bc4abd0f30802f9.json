    "text": "Not your typical love story, \"Tsundere Boyfriend: My Sweet Tyrant\" follows the unusual relationship between Atsuhiro 'Akkun' Kagari and his girlfriend, Non 'Nontan' Katagiri. Despite Akkun's seemingly harsh behavior, verbal abuse, and neglect, he is deeply in love with Nontan. In fact, he's so smitten that he often resorts to stalking her, tailing her and eavesdropping on her conversations. But Nontan, who remains blissfully unaware of Akkun's stalker-like tendencies, finds his actions endearing and thinks he's just being cute. As the story unfolds, viewers will be captivated by the unique dynamic between this unlikely couple, as they navigate the ups and downs of high school romance.",
