    "text": "Shamiko, also known as Shadow Mistress Yuko, is a young succubus aiming to break an ancient curse placed on her impoverished family by their rivals, the powerful Clan of Light. In pursuing this goal, she forms an unlikely alliance with Momo, a magical girl from the very same Clan of Light. These two opposites must work together to uncover the mystery behind another missing magical girl while also investigating a dangerous unknown force lurking in their city. Along the way, they discover surprising truths - the identity of Shamiko's enigmatic father, and the selfless support Momo's missing sister once secretly provided to relieve Shamiko's family's suffering. Though originally enemies, Shamiko and Momo find common ground and purpose in their search. Their mission becomes not only to break a curse, but to reveal hidden secrets that threaten magical beings on all sides.",
