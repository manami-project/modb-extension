Despite the initial shock, Yoshio's curiosity and detachment lead him to feel a secret thrill at being framed. With his reluctant friend, Souji Hashiba, by his side, Yoshio is determined to prove his innocence. As Akechi arrives at the crime scene to investigate, an intense connection forms between the detective and the accused student. Driven by mutual interest, Yoshio expresses his desire to assist Akechi in his crime-solving endeavors, while Akechi is eager to test the young boy's mettle.
