  "synopsis": {
    "text": "City-boy Shinpei Ajiro returns to his quaint hometown of Wakayama City on Hitogashima Island to pay his respects at the funeral of his childhood friend, Ushio Kofune. The island, with its mere thousands of residents, appears serene, but Shinpei soon uncovers a sinister undercurrent. Ushio's death, initially deemed an accidental drowning, raises suspicions when bruises are discovered around her neck, hinting at a darker truth.\n\nShinpei's best friend, Sou Hishigata, shares his doubts about the circumstances surrounding Ushio's death, and the sudden disappearance of an entire neighboring family only serves to heighten their suspicions. As the island's eerie atmosphere thickens, Mio, Ushio's sister, recalls an ancient local folklore about enigmatic entities called 'Shadows.' These beings are believed to mimic human forms and personalities, only to replace them after their untimely demise.\n\nDetermined to unravel the truth behind Ushio's death and protect Mio, Shinpei delves deeper into the island's mysteries. As he confronts the darker side of Hitogashima, he finds himself entangled in a web of supernatural intrigue and impending danger. With each passing day, the line between myth and reality blurs, and Shinpei must race against time to uncover the truth before it's too late.",
