  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the medieval kingdom of Liones, the legendary warriors known as the Seven Deadly Sins were once revered Holy Knights who protected the land. However, they were falsely accused of betraying the kingdom and overthrowing the ruler. Defeated by the remaining Holy Knights, the Sins disappeared. Ten years later, the tyrannical Holy Knights stage a successful coup, overthrowing the king of Liones and seizing control of the kingdom for themselves. Princess Elizabeth, the king's third daughter, narrowly escapes imprisonment. She realizes that the only way to stand against the Holy Knights and restore her father to the throne is to find the infamous Seven Deadly Sins and enlist their help. Elizabeth's search leads her to a quaint tavern run by the unimpressive Meliodas and his talking pig. Despite initial appearances, Meliodas reveals himself as the Dragon Sin of Wrath, leader of the Seven Deadly Sins. Moved by Elizabeth's resolve, he agrees to help her locate the other Sins, believed to be in exile across the land. Though an odd assortment of misfits, perhaps these powerful warriors and their array of fantastical abilities can redeem themselves by saving Liones from the villainous Holy Knights.",
