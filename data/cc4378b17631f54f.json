  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ayase Saki, the most admired beauty in school, and Asamura Yuuta, once mere classmates, find their lives intertwined when Yuuta's father remarries, making them stepsiblings living under the same roof. Having witnessed the complexities of man-woman relationships through their parents' past experiences, they vow to maintain a comfortable distance, neither too close nor too distant. Saki, who has always worked independently for her family, struggles to lean on others, while Yuuta grapples with how to treat her. As they navigate this unfamiliar territory, they gradually discover the soothing rhythm of cohabitation. Their bond, initially that of strangers, evolves subtly with each passing day, hinting at a potential love story in the making.",
