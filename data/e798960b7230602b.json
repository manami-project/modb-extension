    "text": "Fuujin Year 130, in a medieval world filled with magic and gods. Two great kingdoms, Randia and Zenon, have long been at war. Two years ago, Zenon took control of the conflict and Randia fell into decline. But legend says the young Prince Alfred of Randia has the power to unleash a mysterious \"Seal of Power\" and restore his kingdom's strength. When an assassin tries to kill Alfred, his friend and fellow soldier Welles saves his life. Together known as the \"Galloping Winds\" on the battlefield, Alfred and Welles now carry the hope of saving Randia on their shoulders. They set out with Welles' sister Teefa to find and unlock the Seal, pursued by Zenon forces who also seek its power. As war looms again, more allies join Alfred and Welles - including Alfred's former loyal subject Rea, who returns to help in their quest. Through many trials and revelations, the mystery of Alfred's sealed power slowly comes to light...the key to reviving his war-torn kingdom.",
