    "text": "Great Eastern Japan Earthquake Project by NHK presents a heartwarming modern fairy tale featuring beloved characters Domo-kun and Charo. In the bustling city of Tokyo, they encounter a mysterious girl named Zashikiwarashi, who has been unable to return home since 'that day'. When Charo presents her with a wreath of Gerbera plants, a magical burst occurs, resulting in a sneeze that summons a flower train from a garden. As the trio embarks on this enchanting journey towards Zashikiwarashi's hometown in Northeastern Japan, they face a formidable storm. This touching tale not only entertains but also supports the reconstruction efforts in areas affected by the 2011 earthquake.",
