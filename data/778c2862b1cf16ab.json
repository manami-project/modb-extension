  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuâ€™s classmate, Tagiru Akashi, aspires to surpass his senpai, Taiki Kudou, and become the star of their basketball team, Xros Heart. One year after humans and Digimon joined forces to defeat Bagramon, Tagiru stumbles upon DigiQuartz, a mysterious realm between the human and digital worlds. In DigiQuartz, children worldwide partner with Digimon to participate in the Digimon Hunt, a competition to stop corrupted Digimon from wreaking havoc in the human world.\n\nTagiru encounters a trio of Digimon hunters, Ryouma, Ren, and Airu, who warn Taiki about an impending threat to their town. Ignorant of the danger, Tagiru befriends Gumdramon, a Digimon who was being hunted by the trio. Together, they embark on a series of Digimon Hunts, with Tagiru determined to become the top Hunter.\n\nEquipped with a Xros Loader given by a mysterious Watchmaker, Tagiru and Gumdramon face off against MetalTyrannomon in their first hunt. When they are cornered, the Xros Loader activates, allowing Gumdramon to Digivolve into Arresterdramon and defeat MetalTyrannomon. As Tagiru, Taiki, and Yuu delve deeper into the Digimon Hunt, they uncover a sinister force behind the creation of DigiQuartz, revealing that the game is far more complex than they initially thought.",
