  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Totto-chan is a young girl living in Tokyo during World War II. She gets expelled from her previous school and her mother enrolls her in Tomoe Gakuen Primary School, run by headmaster Sosaku Kobayashi. This unusual school uses old railroad cars as classrooms and emphasizes freedom of expression. At Tomoe, Totto-chan has fun while learning important life lessons. She discovers the harsh realities of racism, intolerance, and war. She also benefits from Kobayashi's teaching philosophy - he believes children learn best through freedom and play. Totto-chan forms strong bonds with her teachers and classmates at Tomoe. She credits this wonderful school and its headmaster with setting her on a path to later success as one of Japan's most popular television personalities. This charming series of memoirs recounts Totto-chan's childhood days at a most extraordinary school. With touching stories and endearing characters, it thoughtfully explores childhood joys and hardships while conveying the power of education done right.",
