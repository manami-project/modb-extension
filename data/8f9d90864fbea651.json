    "text": "Azur Lane is a popular mobile game that has released numerous animated commercials and previews over the years. While the animation is unique and not present in the actual game or anime series, these videos serve to promote new in-game events, collaborations, and milestones. Spanning April 2020 to February 2024, there have been over 30 such videos created. They often feature the game's large cast of anthropomorphized warships in scenarios unrelated to the game's main story. Video highlights include 3rd anniversary and 5th anniversary celebration PVs in 2020 and 2022, multiple character-focused PVs like the one for Shikishima in 2021, and crossover videos with franchises such as The Idolmaster and Atelier. With continued new events and collaborations planned for Azur Lane, fans can expect more of these animated videos to release on the official YouTube channel in promotion. Their stylish animation and focus on fan-favorite characters has made them popular with the playerbase over the years.",
