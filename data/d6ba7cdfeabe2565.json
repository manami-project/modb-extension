  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in a time of chaos, seven heroes chosen by the stars rise up to lead the people. Two of them, Taito and Keiro, are destined by fate to oppose one another. Taito is the Hagun, a heroic warrior prophesied to defeat the evil Tonrou. Keiro is the corrupt Tonrou, an ambitious general seeking power no matter the cost. When Keiro begins a violent conquest for a sacred sword to make him a god, Taito awakens to his destiny as the Hagun. Though inexperienced, his mystical star-given abilities could stop Keiro's reign of terror. However, using them recklessly could destroy Taito as well. To control his powers and become a true hero, Taito seeks the guidance of fellow star-warriors. With their help overcoming self-doubt and inexperience, Taito journeys to stop Keiro's destruction. Their fated battle decides not only Taito's future, but the fate of the empire itself.",
