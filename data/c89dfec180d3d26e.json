    "text": "Her alding a fresh start, Makoto Niwa relocates to a bustling city to reside with his aunt while his parents are overseas, eager to live the quintessential adolescent life. To gauge his experiences, he meticulously assigns points to his actions, striving for a favorable score. However, his dreams of a typical teenage life are shattered when he encounters his enigmatic, self-proclaimed alien cousin, Erio Touwa. Erio, who prefers to enshroud herself in a futon and subsists mainly on pizza, had vanished for six months only to be discovered adrift at sea, bereft of any memories from her disappearance. As Makoto navigates his aunt's vivacious attention, awkward school flirtations, and Erio's eccentricities, he finds himself inexplicably drawn to helping his cousin reconnect with society and curb her alien-inspired peculiarities. Brace yourself for a thrilling, extraordinary journey that challenges the notion of a conventional adolescence.",
