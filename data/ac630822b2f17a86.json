    "text": "Seamstresses and Saviors collide in a world where tiny entities, known as Aguu, bestow extraordinary talents upon their chosen hosts. At the heart of this conflict are two friends, Ai and Machi, bound together by their shared love for dance. While Ai is an ordinary girl, Machi is a gifted dancer, leaving Ai feeling overshadowed at times. However, when Ai uncovers Machi's secret connection to the Aguu, she finds herself drawn into a centuries-old battle between the Seamstresses who create these entities and the Saviors who fight against them. In a quest to save her friend from the mysterious world of the Aguu, Ai takes on the role of a Savior, embarking on a journey that will challenge everything she knows about talent, friendship, and the true cost of genius.",
