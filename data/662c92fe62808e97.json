    "text": "In the heart of the Grand Line, amidst a raging storm, the Straw Hat Pirates stumble upon a sinking ship, discovering a treasure chest that holds not gold, but an unexpected surprise - an elderly woman. To return her home to Mecha Island, she entices the crew with tales of a legendary Golden Crown. Lured by the promise of adventure and treasure, the crew sets sail, only to be greeted by the island's ruler, Ratchet, who initially mistakes them for kidnappers. After a tumultuous welcome, Ratchet enlists their help to unravel the island's enigmatic riddles and uncover the elusive Golden Crown. As they navigate through a labyrinth of inventions and traps, the crew must decipher cryptic clues hidden within an old folk song, leading them closer to the island's coveted secret.",
