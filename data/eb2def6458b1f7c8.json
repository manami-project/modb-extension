  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From the unusual to the downright bizarre, the anime Higepiyo follows the adventures of a mustachioed chick and his human companion, Hiroshi. Higepiyo, who was once an experimental lab subject, is anything but your typical chick. He boasts a mustache, a penchant for reading the newspaper, and a knack for engaging in schoolyard scuffles on behalf of his friend, Hiroshi. After being purchased by Hiroshi's family at a festival, Higepiyo finds himself in a new home where he must navigate the peculiarities of his newfound life. With a love for food and a tendency to engage in fisticuffs, Higepiyo proves to be a handful for his new family. But despite his eccentricities, Higepiyo is still a chick at heart, and Hiroshi and his family must learn to embrace the unconventional and find the joy in their new life with their extraordinary pet. Prepare for a wild ride filled with laughter, heartwarming moments, and a mustache-wearing chick like no other in Higepiyo.",
