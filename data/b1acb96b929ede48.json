    "text": "An ordinary middle school art club filled with extraordinary characters, Tsukimori Middle School's art club is anything but typical. The club boasts of a talented artist, Uchimaki Subaru, who squanders his potential in pursuit of drawing the perfect 2D wife. Usami Mizuki, a dedicated member, finds herself constantly distracted by the antics of her fellow club members and her own feelings for Subaru. The club president, a perpetual sleeper, appears to care for the group despite her constant napping. Adding to the mix is the enigmatic Colette, a wealthy prankster who never misses an opportunity to stir up trouble. As Mizuki navigates through the daily challenges of the art club, she strives to keep the group focused on their artistic pursuits in the light-hearted and comedic world of Kono Bijutsubu ni wa Mondai ga Aru!",
