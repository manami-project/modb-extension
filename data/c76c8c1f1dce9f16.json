    "text": "The future of humanity hangs in the balance as enigmatic extraterrestrials known as Victims wreak havoc across the cosmos, annihilating all but one human world: Zion. In this dire time, hope lies in the hands of five extraordinary pilots who command sentient, cutting-edge combat robots called Ingrids, or \"Goddesses.\" The Goddess Operator Academy (GOA) serves as the training ground for these exceptional pilots, fostering both fierce rivalries and unbreakable bonds among them.\n\nAt the heart of this story are Ernest Cuore, a seasoned and skilled Goddess pilot, and the budding pilots Zero Enna and Hiead Gner. As they navigate their way through the GOA, they not only hone their combat abilities but also confront dark secrets and mysteries surrounding Zero and the Goddess Ingrid. With the constant threat of Victim attacks looming, these young heroes must rise to the challenge and safeguard their world, forging friendships and rivalries that will shape their destiny and that of humanity. The tale unfolds through the eyes of Ernest Cuore, offering a unique perspective on the trials and triumphs of these brave pilots and their sentient machines.",
