    "text": "Narita Imomushi's fantasy manga comes to life in this enchanting anime, featuring Astra Ludger Doomsday, a retired royal knight captain who's recently achieved his lifelong dream: trading his sword for a cozy home. But his tranquil existence is disrupted when an apprentice witch literally crashes into his life, mistaking him for someone else.\n\nOne day, inspired by a magazine article, Astra embarks on a mission to host the perfect garage sale, hoping to add a touch of excitement to his new life as a homeowner. Together with Noah, they eagerly await customers, only to be greeted by familiar faces - both human and not - who seem more interested in stirring up trouble than buying anything. Can Astra and Noah turn the chaos into a successful sale?\n\nThis heartwarming and humorous tale follows Astra's adventures in his new life, filled with unexpected visitors, magical mishaps, and the occasional attempt at suburban normalcy. Join Astra as he navigates the peculiarities of his newfound domestic bliss in this captivating anime.",
