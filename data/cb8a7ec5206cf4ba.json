    "text": "Heavenly realms, once thriving after the epic Battle of the Gods, now lie in ruins. In this declining era, Yang Jian, a former deity wronged and now a humble bounty hunter, is tasked with tracking down a young man. Shockingly, this man is none other than his estranged nephew, Shen Xiang. Shen Xiang's quest to save his mother by retrieving the mystical Lotus Lamp and splitting the mountain is prophesied to bring forth a catastrophic disaster. As Yang Jian navigates through the echoes of his past, he must confront the consequences of his actions and thwart a band of ruthless vigilantes, all vying for the same world-altering treasure. The journey that unfolds is a race against time, testing the boundaries of family, fate, and redemption.",
