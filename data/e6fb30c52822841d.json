    "text": "Shimizu Apartments welcomes a peculiar new resident, Kotarou Satou, a four-year-old boy who not only lives independently but also exhibits an uncanny maturity for his age. With a penchant for carrying a toy sword and speaking in an old-fashioned dialect, Kotarou quickly captivates the hearts of his quirky neighbors, including Shin Karino, a struggling manga artist. Despite his self-sufficiency, Kotarou's childlike innocence shines through, and his unique charm fosters a sense of camaraderie among the apartment dwellers. As they rally around Kotarou, supporting him in his daily endeavors, they begin to uncover the enigmatic circumstances surrounding his parents and upbringing. In turn, Kotarou's inquisitive nature and unfiltered curiosity challenge his newfound friends, leading to moments of introspection and growth. Together, they form an unconventional yet loving family, proving that sometimes, home is where the heart is.",
