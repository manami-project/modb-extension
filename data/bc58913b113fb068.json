  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the third My Hero Academia movie installment, a sinister anti-Quirk organization called Humarise threatens to destroy all people with superpowers. Led by the extremist Flect Turn, they have constructed lethal \"Trigger Bombs\" designed to cause those with Quirks to lose control and perish. With only two hours until Humarise detonates Trigger Bombs they have hidden across the globe, panic spreads as this could signify the end of hero society. Top heroes like Endeavor and talented U.A. students including Izuku \"Deku\" Midoriya, Katsuki Bakugo and Shoto Todoroki are dispatched internationally to try locating and disarming the bombs. While interning under Endeavor in the country of Otheon, Deku finds himself wrongly accused of murder after unsuccessfully trying to stop a bank robbery. Now a fugitive, he ends up on the run with Roddy Soul, the would-be robber. With Roddy's help and teamwork from his classmates, Deku races against the clock to clear his name and foil Humariseâ€™s apocalyptic plot before the two hour deadline passes.",
