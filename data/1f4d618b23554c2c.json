    "text": "Detective Pikachu and his human partner Tim face a sweet mystery when Tim's flan disappears from the fridge. The spunky Pok√©mon detective is eager to film his morning routine, but puts his plans on hold to help Tim find the missing custard dessert. With Pikachu's electrifying deduction skills and Tim's keen eye for clues, the crime-solving duo set out to crack the case in this lighthearted animated adventure. Though the culprit remains elusive, Pikachu and Tim make for an amusingly mismatched, yet oddly endearing, mystery-solving team as they seek to rescue the pilfered flan. Their quirky camaraderie promises clever fun for viewers, whether or not the missing treat is recovered by the story's end.",
