    "text": "Fifth-grader Toriyasu and his optimistic younger sister, Meeko, embark on an extraordinary journey to a feline-dominated world called Banipal Witt, seeking their beloved missing dog, Papadoll. After being whisked away by a group of cats, the siblings find themselves transformed into cats and learn that Papadoll has been mutated into a monstrous dog by the sinister Princess Buburina.\n\nThe cursed princess, whose touch turns anyone into balloons, has taken control of Papadoll to terrorize the inhabitants of Banipal Witt. Initially skeptical of the bizarre situation, Toriyasu is compelled to join the rebellion against Princess Buburina when his sister is taken captive.\n\nWith the help of the cat scientists and a powerful sorcerer named Sandada, Toriyasu must break the curse and save both Papadoll and the ballooned citizens before the next sunrise. The fate of Banipal Witt and their own world hangs in the balance, as they race against time to restore normalcy and return home.",
