  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It was foretold that a hero would emerge to save the beleaguered land of Esteria from the relentless onslaught of mythical beasts, and that hero is Adol Christin. Driven by an inexplicable urge, the young adventurer sets sail from Promarock, seeking the distant and mystical island of Esteria. Upon his arrival, Adol learns that he is the chosen one, destined to put an end to the monstrous scourge that has plagued the land and its people.\n\nWith the guidance of the wise fortuneteller Sarah Tovah, Adol and his allies embark on a treacherous quest to find the legendary Books of Ys â€“ six mystical tomes that hold the key to defeating the evil priest Dark Fact and restoring peace to Esteria. As they journey through the island, they face countless perils and confront hordes of demonic creatures, but Adol's unwavering determination and courage may just be enough to turn the tide in their favor.\n\nBased on the classic action RPG, Ys follows Adol Christin on his epic adventure to save Esteria and uncover the secrets of the ancient and powerful Books of Ys. Will he succeed in his quest and become the hero that Esteria so desperately needs? Only time will tell.",
