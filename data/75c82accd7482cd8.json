    "text": "Sumire is an ordinary high school girl who has had the ability to see ghosts from a young age. Her life changes when she meets Lucia, a member of the Venus Vanguard - a group dedicated to fighting demons known as Viruses that prey on human souls. After a chance encounter, Lucia's demon-hunting brooch accidentally gives Sumire strange new powers - allowing her to see the Viruses clearly and even destroy them. Sumire joins forces with Lucia and the Venus Vanguard to battle the spreading Virus threat, using her unlocked spiritual powers which could also turn dangerously destructive. As the girls fight the darkness and uncover the origins of the Viruses, they learn important lessons about saving lives and the potential for good and evil within themselves. Their strengthening companionship gives them the courage to keep defending humankind from its greatest supernatural threat.",
