    "text": "She may seem like an ordinary, shy, and popular schoolgirl, but Sumire Takahana's life takes a supernatural turn when she discovers her ability to see ghosts. Dismissed as a liar by her loved ones, Sumire's life changes forever when she encounters Lucia Nahashi, a gothic-loli demon slayer, and her enchanted brooch.\n\nThe brooch accidentally bestows Sumire with extraordinary powers, transforming her into a living antivirus capable of battling the malevolent, soul-consuming entities known as Virus. With Lucia as her mentor and protector, Sumire joins the Venus Vanguard, a clandestine organization operating beneath a seemingly normal shop.\n\nTogether, they fight to eradicate the Virus and safeguard humanity. As they delve deeper into the mysteries surrounding these dark spirits, Sumire and Lucia unlock their own hidden potential and learn valuable lessons about the worth of every life. Will they succeed in their mission, or will the Virus consume them and the world they've sworn to protect?",
