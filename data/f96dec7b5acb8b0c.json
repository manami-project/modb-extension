  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The narrative unfolds in a futuristic city named Cahmpon, where a scientist's experiment results in the creation of Noiseman, a synthetic being with the ability to convert musical waves into crystals, effectively silencing the city's melodies. In response to this musical tyranny, a group of rebellious biker kids take a stand against Noiseman, aiming to liberate their city from his oppressive grip. This captivating short film, produced by Beyond C and Bandai Visual in 1997, showcases the creative prowess of Koji Morimoto, known for his work on Beyond as part of the Animatrix, and the musical genius of Yoko Kanno, who masterfully transforms noise and waves into harmonious tunes. The story takes an intriguing turn when Noiseman develops a fascination for the crystals, manipulating the townspeople and leading to a confrontation with Tobio, a young hunter determined to challenge Noiseman's dominance.",
