    "text": "Labelled as an outcast and a misfit, Mo Fan, an ordinary high school student, wakes up in an extraordinary world where magic reigns supreme and monstrous beasts threaten human existence. Despite the shift in reality, Mo Fan's life remains as challenging as ever. He is still the son of a struggling laborer, the older brother to a disabled sister, and the target of scorn and ridicule at school.\n\nDetermined to change his family's fortune, Mo Fan sets his sights on becoming a powerful magician, a revered and affluent profession in this new world. Against all odds, he gains admission to a prestigious magic institution, only to be met with mockery and disdain due to his impoverished background and perceived lack of magical ability.\n\nHowever, Mo Fan defies expectations by mastering not one, but two formidable elements: fire and the rare lightning. Armed with his newfound dual abilities, Mo Fan embarks on a dangerous journey filled with magical challenges and menacing creatures. Will his unique powers and unwavering determination be enough to overcome the trials ahead and achieve his dream of changing his family's fate? Only time will tell as Mo Fan navigates this perilous and enchanting world of magic.",
