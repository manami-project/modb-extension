    "text": "Mizuki Ashiya, a talented Japanese-American track star, transfers to an all-boys high school in Japan with a specific goal in mind - to get close to her idol, high jumper Izumi Sano. To achieve this, she disguises herself as a boy. Fate intervenes when Mizuki and Izumi become roommates at the school. Now, Mizuki must work extra hard to keep her biological gender a secret from her classmates and teachers. This proves challenging in the classroom, locker room, and even in her own bedroom. Meanwhile, Izumi begins questioning his own sexual orientation upon meeting his new, feminine-looking roommate. The other boys at school also start to wonder if the new student might be gay. As Mizuki and Izumi spend more time together, a deeper bond begins to form. Mizuki wants to confess her love to Izumi, but worries he will reject her if he discovers she is biologically female. The story explores themes of gender identity, sexuality, and the lengths one will go to get close to their crush.",
