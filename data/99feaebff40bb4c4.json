  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A determined frog wearing a distinctive armband tries to organize a group of carefree frogs into an orderly line. Though eager to assert authority, his efforts are largely ignored by the others who simply continue hopping around. Focusing on the dynamic between leaders and followers, this animation depicts the frog's increasingly forceful attempts to control the group, such as shouting commands or physically moving the frogs. However, his ambitions face unexpected challenges that undermine his position. Through this lighthearted frog tale, the story explores profound themes regarding obedience, resistance, and the complex nature of power. The vivid characters and expressive animation bring an insightful perspective to the timeless struggle between the ruling and the ruled.",
