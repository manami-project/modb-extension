    "text": "Yuzuki, Hotaru, Yuna, Sayu, and Saya are the stars of Copihan, a school comedy set in Tokyo in the year 2034. This anime is a collaboration between Gonzo and Kei, the renowned illustrator of Hatsune Miku and the manga version of Copihan. In this futuristic world, the traditional concept of money has been replaced by an electronic money system, and the city is bustling with high school students, office workers, and city employees living their lives to the fullest. Yuna, a reserved high school student, finds herself constantly in the limelight despite her best efforts to avoid it. Yuzuki, a baseball prodigy, outshines all the boys on the field. Hotaru harbors a seductive secret, while Sayu and Saya are the energetic duo who love to broadcast the latest news over the school intercom. Copihan is a vibrant tapestry of stories that explores the lives of these characters as they navigate the modern world of 2034.",
