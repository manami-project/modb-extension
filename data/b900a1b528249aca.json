  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2035, ancient giant stone heads resembling Greek gods were unearthed around the world. These finds coincided with a cataclysmic climate event called the Equatorial Winter that nearly caused humanity's extinction. The mysterious stone heads enabled humans to survive and advance their technology, but they also compelled nations to build giant robotic suits of armor to battle for control and influence. Now, in the aftermath of the disaster, countries deploy these colossal robots to war with one another, vying to establish a new world order amid the post-apocalyptic landscape. At the center of this conflict are 13-year-old Shingo and 14-year-old Mana, the young pilots of Japan's formidable mech. Despite their youth, the fate of Japan rests on their shoulders as they fight to determine the course of human civilization. This anime promises high-stakes robot battles set against an imaginative post-apocalyptic future, where the survival of humanity hangs in the balance. At its emotional core is the story of two brave teenagers forced by circumstance to shoulder immense responsibility for their nation.",
