    "text": "Kabuto Kouji is kidnapped and the once peaceful symbol, Great Mazinger, is seized by the malevolent Vega Military, leaving Earth's fate hanging in the balance. The Vegan forces, led by the newly appointed Captain Batus, threaten to exile Earth's defenders to the Freezing Universe if they fail to defeat UFO Robo Grandizer. In a desperate bid to harness Great Mazinger's power for their nefarious plans, the Vegans launch an attack. With Kouji held captive and Great Mazinger under enemy control, all hope rests on the mighty UFO Robo Grandizer to save the world from imminent destruction. As alien invaders take over the museum where Great Mazinger and Mazinger Z stand as symbols of peace, only Grandizer has the power to repel the evil forces and reclaim Great Mazinger. In this thrilling battle, Duke Fleed and UFO Robo Grandizer must rise to the challenge to prevent humanity's former protector from becoming its ultimate destroyer.",
