  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mai Kawai is a young police officer who has become disillusioned with her career choice. Despite working hard to join the force, she faces criticism from the public and begins to lose passion for the job. Just as she is about to resign, Mai meets Seiko Fuji, the new female director at her station. Seiko is a brilliant former detective who has been transferred to Mai's ordinary police box. Mai is immediately inspired by Seiko's confidence, skill, and commitment to the job. As the two women work together, Seiko reignites Mai's drive to be a great officer. While solving cases, Mai also tries to uncover the reason why someone of Seiko's caliber was assigned to such an unexceptional post. Through their deepening mentor-mentee bond, both women rediscover their devotion to law enforcement and supporting their community. Together, they prove that women can excel as police officers despite the adversity they face in this male-dominated profession.",
