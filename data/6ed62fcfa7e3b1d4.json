  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wary of the mundane life of a salaryman, Mukoda Tsuyoshi finds himself unexpectedly whisked away to a realm brimming with magic and swordplay. However, instead of being hailed as a hero, he's dismissed as a mistake by the kingdom that summoned him. Armed with nothing more than an 'Online Supermarket' skill, which allows him to summon everyday items from his old world, Mukoda embarks on a journey to carve out a peaceful existence in this unfamiliar land.\n\nAs he navigates through this new world, Mukoda discovers that his seemingly mundane skill holds unexpected power. The modern food he prepares using items from his 'Online Supermarket' captivates the inhabitants, including the legendary wolf Fenrir, who becomes his devoted companion in exchange for daily meals.\n\nWith Fenrir by his side, Mukoda sets off on an adventure as a merchant and cook, leaving behind the kingdom's suspicious intentions and embracing a life filled with culinary delights and extraordinary encounters. As he journeys on, Mukoda's unassuming skill transforms him into a renowned figure, captivating the hearts and palates of those he meets.",
