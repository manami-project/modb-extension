  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a meteorite strikes the earth in medieval Japan, a baby boy is discovered at the impact site and named Sarutobi Sasuke. Raised to serve the powerful Sanada family, Sasuke becomes a formidable ninja with extraordinary abilities. As the Tokugawa clan seeks to consolidate their power in the Fifth Year of the Keicho era, Hidetada Tokugawa arrives at Ueda Castle, demanding the Sanada clan's submission. However, the Sanada and their loyal retainers have no intention of surrendering.\n\nIn Tensho Era 10 (AD 1583), Oda Nobunaga's troops invaded Takeda territory in Shinshu, and a meteor fell on the border of Joshu, bringing Sarutobi Sasuke into the world. Under the guidance of Sanada Nobushige (also known as Sanada Yukimura), Sasuke becomes a master ninja. Sanada Masayuki, Nobushige's father, is renowned for his strategic prowess. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the 2,000 soldiers of Ueda Castle, led by Nobushige and his subordinates, including Sasuke, fiercely resist the 38,000 soldiers of the Tokugawa.\n\nAs the Tokugawa shogunate threatens to engulf Japan, the Sanada family is torn between those who would join the invaders and those who would preserve their heritage. In the end, only Genjiro Sanada and his father remain to defend their ancestral home, Ueda Castle. With Sarutobi Sasuke's unique skills, will they be able to protect Japan from the Tokugawa's ruthless ambitions?",
