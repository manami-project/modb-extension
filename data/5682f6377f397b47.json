    "text": "Lin is a young woman working at an animation company in a big, modern city, pursuing her dream of becoming an animator. Consumed by her work, she is unable to return her father's calls. When she lands an important role on a new project, the immense pressure causes Lin's inspiration to vanish. Gripped by self-doubt and unable to draw, she returns home hoping to regain her confidence. Back in her hometown, Lin discovers a childhood sketchbook she made with her father, sparking nostalgic memories of her early artistic passion. Reconnecting with her first love of drawing rekindles Lin's creativity and self-belief. Embracing her dreams once more, she devotes herself to her craft and creating beautiful animations. This is an uplifting story of a young artist who loses her way under intense pressure, only to rediscover her creative spirit back home amongst loving memories. It is a tale of inspiration renewed and passion reignited.",
