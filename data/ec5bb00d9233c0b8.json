    "text": "As the dust settled a decade ago, the valiant hero Max triumphed over the Demon Lord, who vowed to return stronger than ever. Now, the Demon Lord has awakened from his slumber, only to find himself in a diminutive, chibi form. Eager to face his nemesis once more, he seeks out Max, only to find the once-great hero living a life of squalor and idleness. Determined to restore his adversary's former glory, the Demon Lord moves in with Max, aiming to rekindle the spirit of the hero he once knew. But as the Demon Lord delves deeper into Max's life, he uncovers unexpected truths about the hero's fall from grace. Can the Demon Lord successfully transform the fallen hero back into a worthy opponent, or will he find himself drawn into Max's uninspiring world?",
