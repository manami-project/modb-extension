    "text": "Aratama, malevolent entities threatening humanity, have been kept at bay by shrine maidens known as Toji for centuries. These young women, clad in school uniforms and armed with swords, serve as a special religious service police squad, authorized by the government to protect the populace. Toji attend one of five government-established schools across the country, where they balance ordinary school lives with their sacred duties, wielding their swords and honing their unique powers to defend the people.\n\nAs spring approaches, the most skilled Toji from each school are chosen to compete in a prestigious tournament, representing their institution and striving to enhance their abilities. Among these competitors, one girl stands out, her determination to improve her swordsmanship surpassing that of her peers. As the tournament unfolds, the world of the Toji is thrown into disarray, with unexpected challenges and potential betrayals lurking in the shadows. What destiny awaits this passionate sword-wielding maiden and her fellow Toji?",
