  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Apprentice mage Azaka Kokutou is sent by her mentor, Touko Aozaki, to investigate strange events happening at her school, Reien Academy, over winter break. Fairies have been stealing students' memories, but they are invisible to Azaka. She receives help from acquaintance Shiki Ryougi, who has special eyes allowing her to see what Azaka cannot. Although the two struggle to get along due to Azaka's jealousy over Shiki's bond with Azaka's brother, they must work together as the fairy crisis escalates. Shiki discovers student council president Misaya Ouji has gained the power to control the fairies from magus Satsuki Kurogiri, who wields command over words. Ironically, Satsuki's magic helps restore Shiki's memory of her past encounter with puppeteer Souren Araya. Despite their differences, Azaka and Shiki unravel the scheme's many layers to save the academy and its students.",
