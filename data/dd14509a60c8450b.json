    "text": "Hope's Peak Academy is a prestigious government-recognized school for talented students who excel in various fields. The school has a main course for ultimates with exceptional abilities, and a preparatory course that anyone can join if they have money, even without talents. The eccentric 77th class of ultimates in the main course have unique personalities and talents, ranging from princesses to nurses to yakuza. Their teacher Chisa Yukizome tries to nurture them into better people who value relationships over talent. Meanwhile, Hajime Hinata, an unremarkable reserve course student without talents, yearns to be special. He meets Chiaki Nanami, the class 77-B's Ultimate Gamer, who gives him a hopeful perspective. However, the school's administrators secretly discriminate against the reserve course and plan a mysterious project centered around Hajime to cultivate an \"Ultimate Hope\" by any means. This project, along with the tensions between the main course and reserve course, eventually plunge the school into despair and kickstart \"The Biggest, Most Awful, Most Tragic Event in Human History.\"",
