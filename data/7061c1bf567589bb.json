    "text": "After half a year of warfare between the Megazone and the invading alien force called the Dezalg, the future looks bleak for the Megazone's inhabitants. With weaponry fifty years more advanced, the Dezalg have continuously gained ground, defeating the Megazone's military in battle after battle. In an attempt to resume some semblance of normalcy, Shogo Yahagi has been leading a motorcycle gang, expressing his rebellion against the very government he once fought alongside. But when the remnants of the artificial intelligence EVE reach out for help, Shogo finds himself drawn back into the conflict. EVE reveals a potential safeguard that could protect some of the Megazone's people from the ruthless Dezalg onslaught. However, enacting this defense program requires recovering Shogo's iconic motorcycle, the Garland. With EVE's guidance, Shogo races against time, evading both the military and the police to secure the Garland before the Dezalg bring about complete annihilation. In this climactic installment, the stage is set for a final showdown between choppers and mechas, with Shogo and EVE making one last stand for the Megazone's survival. Though EVE still hides one final revelation that threatens even the best laid plans.",
