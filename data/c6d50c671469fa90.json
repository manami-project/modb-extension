    "text": "Japanese Featherweight Champion, Makunouchi Ippo, braces himself for his inaugural title defense against a formidable adversary, Sanada Kazukiâ€”a former Jr. Featherweight champion and current medical student. Sanada's coach, Hama Dankichi, a past rival of Ippo's trainer Kamogawa, adds another layer of complexity to the impending battle. As Ippo grapples with mounting anxiety and fear, Sanada's medical background and intelligent tactics pose a significant threat. The stakes are further raised as Sanada works alongside Ippo's love interest, Kumi, in the same hospital, with everyone rooting for Sanada's victory. As the day of reckoning draws near, Ippo must confront not only his opponent but also the unbeatable 'Hien' move passed down to Sanada. Will Ippo emerge triumphant and reclaim both his title and his love?",
