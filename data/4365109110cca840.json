    "text": "In the anime \"Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun,\" the protagonist Iruma Suzuki, a compassionate 14-year-old, finds himself in an unusual predicament when his negligent parents sell him to a demon. Instead of becoming a demon's snack, Iruma is adopted by the formidable demon Sullivan, who insists on being his grandfather. Sullivan, who also happens to be the principal of a prestigious demon school, enrolls Iruma as a student.\n\nAs the only human in a school full of demons, Iruma must navigate through a myriad of challenges while keeping his true identity a secret. From dueling with a proud demon student to befriending a girl struggling to fit in, Iruma's life is anything but ordinary. Despite the constant fear of being discovered, Iruma's inherent kindness shines through, winning over even the most formidable foes.\n\nWith his new demon grandfather pushing him into the spotlight, Iruma must find a way to survive in this supernatural world while maintaining his pacifist nature. As he stumbles through one bizarre situation after another, Iruma's extraordinary school life unfolds in the most unexpected ways.",
