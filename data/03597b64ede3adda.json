    "text": "BeyWarriors: Cyborg takes place on Teslandia, an abandoned planet ignored by nearby planets due to its harsh environment. Mysterious vehicles called \"Beyraiderz\" are discovered in power spots around Teslandia known as \"Sanctuaries.\" The Beyraiderz synchronize with Teslandian youths under 17, allowing them to summon cyborg creatures called Warriors. The Warriors can transform the high-energy Sanctuaries into Tokens. Battling the Warriors against each other produces more Tokens, which can restore Teslandia into a lush, habitable world. A competition erupts over who can win the most battles and collect the most Tokens. There is also a mystery behind the origins and purpose of the Warriors. BeyWarriors: Cyborg combines the popular Beyblade franchise with a fresh sci-fi setting and cyborg action. Teen Beybattlers fight for control over Teslandia, but the Warriors may have their own agenda. With intense battles and intrigue, this spinoff aims to engage existing fans and attract new ones.",
