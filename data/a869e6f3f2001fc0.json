  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the Shohoku high school basketball team as they take on their rivals, the Tsukubu team, in a critical inter-high championship game. The stakes are high - the winner will advance to play the powerhouse Shoyo team next, bringing them one step closer to the national tournament. Adding spice to the matchup, Tsukubu's coach is a former student of Shohoku's beloved coach Anzai. Both coaches aim to lead their teams to victory with their signature styles - Anzai guiding Shohoku's unorthodox yet talented players versus his student's well-drilled Tsukubu squad. On a personal level, several acquaintances reconnect in this game. Shohoku's captain Akagi and vice-captain Kogure encounter their former classmate Godai, now Tsukubu's captain. Hot-headed Sakuragi locks horns with Tsukubu's center Nango, who irks him by vying for the attention of Sakuragi's crush Haruko. With so many subplots at play, the stage is set for a dramatic, high-stakes game between the two passionate teams. As the final buzzer sounds, only one will claim bragging rights and progress on their quest for national glory.",
