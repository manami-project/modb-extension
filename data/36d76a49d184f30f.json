    "text": "Force fully displaced from their hometown in China, Kei Narutani and his lifelong friend, Minghua Song, find themselves fleeing from the Zai, a menacing and enigmatic organization that wreaks havoc on their country. During their perilous journey to seek refuge in Japan, they narrowly escape a Zai attack, thanks to the intervention of an unusual red aircraft.\n\nKei's fascination with the mysterious aircraft leads him to cross paths with Gripen, an endearing girl who is, in fact, an 'Anima.' Anima are automated piloting mechanisms, taking the form of human girls, created to control mechanized soldiers known as 'Daughters' - humanity's ultimate defense against the Zai.\n\nAs Kei forges a connection with Gripen, he finds himself recruited by the Japan Self-Defense Force to help her overcome her flying difficulties. Together with Eagle, an easygoing F-15J-ANM, and Phantom, a proud RF-4EJ-ANM, they form a squadron committed to safeguarding humanity from the relentless alien threat.\n\nWith the world's aerial combat forces decimated and the future of mankind hanging in the balance, Kei and his newfound allies take to the skies, united as the last bastion against the Zai's onslaught.",
