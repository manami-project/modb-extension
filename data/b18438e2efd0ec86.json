  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime explores the fleeting nature of girlhood through a poetic and symbolic lens. It follows a group of young girls connected by a mysterious red ribbon. This ribbon represents the bonds of friendship and intimacy they share, as well as the inevitability of growing up. As the girls grow older, their bodies undergo changes against their will, abruptly ending their carefree days. The ribbon \"gives and takes,\" forcing adulthood upon them. Yet there is a resistance to letting go of innocence on the girls' part, along with a hatred toward the imposition of society's expectations. Ultimately, this is a bittersweet ode to the ephemerality of youth, rendered through dreamlike animation. It aims to cherish the special moments that only girls can share, before time transforms them into women.",
