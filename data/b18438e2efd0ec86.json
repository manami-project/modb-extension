    "text": "Work of art from a 2012 graduate of Tokyo University of the Arts, Toyomi Morishita, presents a poignant tale of girlhood and the unavoidable march towards adulthood. In this animation, a mysterious red ribbon of the double spiral, known as \"xx,\" binds young girls together, allowing them to share tender moments and create cherished memories. However, this delicate bond also brings about an unexpected transformation, forcing the girls to confront the harsh realities of life.\n\nAs the girls struggle to resist the inevitable loss of innocence and the hatred that accompanies it, they find themselves entangled in a web of fate that both gives and takes. Meanwhile, in a quaint Japanese village, an elderly couple who have spent their lives together crafting beautiful blooms must face new challenges when the wife begins to exhibit symptoms of an illness. This heartwarming and thought-provoking animation explores the complexities of growing up and the resilience of the human spirit in the face of adversity.",
