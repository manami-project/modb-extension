    "text": "Observing the everyday life of Yawara Inokuma, you'd think she's just your average high school girl with dreams of cooking, fashion, and finding the perfect boyfriend. However, beneath this ordinary facade lies an extraordinary secret - Yawara is a prodigious judo talent, nurtured by her formidable grandfather, Jigoro, a five-time national judo champion. With aspirations of seeing his granddaughter win an Olympic gold medal, Jigoro has been honing Yawara's skills since she was a toddler.\n\nAs Yawara strives to maintain her normal life, her grandfather sets the stage for her debut match, scouting the perfect rival in the multitalented and affluent Sayaka Honami. Sayaka, a force to be reckoned with in various sports, discovers her passion for judo after witnessing Jigoro's prowess. This marks the beginning of an epic saga featuring two young rivals destined to reshape the world of women's judo.\n\nMeanwhile, Kousaku Matsuda, a relentless sports reporter, senses Yawara's untapped potential and becomes determined to bring her into the limelight, even if it means pushing her out of her comfort zone. As Yawara navigates through the challenges of adolescence, she must also confront her destiny as a potential judo superstar, balancing her desires for normalcy with her extraordinary abilities.",
