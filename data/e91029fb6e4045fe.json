The demon king Xie Jie harbors a sinister plan to summon the Heavenly Demon, a formidable entity poised to subdue both the demon and human realms. With the ominous resurrection of the Heavenly Demon looming four years ahead, the exorcists must rally young talents to prepare for the impending battle.\n\nAs they reunite at the border, the exorcists encounter an unexpected uprising of war-torn ghouls, hinting at a deeper connection to the elusive White Deer. The exorcists, including the ambitious Hongjun and Jinglong, embark on a mission to uncover the truth behind these events and thwart the demon's conspiracy. As they delve deeper into the mystery, they strive to secure powerful alliances and restore peace to a world teetering on the brink of chaos.",
