    "text": "Set in 1960s Japan, Young Black Jack chronicles the origin story of Hazama Kuroo, a gifted medical student with unusual black and white hair and mysterious scars. Though reserved, Kuroo's genius surgical skills start gaining attention after he completes seemingly impossible operations. As student protests, war, and corruption consume the country, Kuroo finds himself embroiled in nefarious situations that challenge his integrity. Together with the honest intern Maiko and his troubled friend Yabu, Kuroo struggles to navigate the complex medical world riddled with potential for abuse. He strives to prove himself to earn respect as a surgeon while grappling with the temptation for doctors to play God. Kuroo suspects the medical system is being exploited and feels compelled to act, despite risks to his career and safety. Young Black Jack depicts Kuroo's journey to become the unlicensed maverick surgeon known as Black Jack - a legend capable of medical miracles, yet scarred by tragedy. Witness the making of this complex doctor prepared to bend the rules for the greater good.",
