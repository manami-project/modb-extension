    "text": "Basho, a captivating music video project by the artist group Chronicle, takes viewers on an emotional journey through a unique blend of visual and auditory storytelling. In a distant future, a young girl named Sachi finds herself confined to a hospital due to an incurable illness. As she gazes out her window, she develops feelings for a boy, Ryou, who attends school nearby. Struggling with her newfound emotions and the isolation brought on by her condition, Sachi's reality begins to merge with a digital world.\n\nIn this virtual space, Sachi plays a crucial role in recreating a long-lost city. As the lines between reality and the digital realm blur, she finds herself subconsciously attempting to draw Ryou into this world. With visuals crafted by the talented loundraw and sounds masterfully orchestrated by Hideya Kojima, the song \"Kimi no Iru Basho\" serves as the backdrop for this poignant tale of love, loneliness, and the power of connection.",
