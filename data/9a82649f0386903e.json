  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a technologically advanced future, a terminally ill girl named Sachi is hospitalized and enlisted to help recreate a lost city in virtual reality. From her hospital room, she watches a boy named Ryou attend school, and over time, develops feelings for him. As her emotions grow, the lines separating reality and simulation blur. Sachi yearns to bring Ryou into her virtual world, not fully comprehending her developing affection. This story is told through an animated music video set to the song \"Kimi no Iru Basho\" by the artist group Chronicle. The visuals were created by loundraw while Hideya Kojima composed the music. The wistful tale explores love and longing through the unique perspective of Sachi's confused but earnest emotions. As reality and fantasy intertwine, viewers are left to ponder the nature of human connection.",
