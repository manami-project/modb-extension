  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyoko's eccentric crew at Wagnaria family restaurant is back, serving up laughter, love, and chaos in equal measure! Souta Takanashi, the part-time worker, finds himself in the midst of it all, as he navigates his way through the quirks of his co-workers. From the bug-loving tears of Souta himself, to the height-complex of Popura Taneshima, and the androphobic punches of Inami Mahiru, every day brings a new adventure. Joining the mix are Haruna, Hyougo Otoo's wife with a peculiar sense of direction, Kirio Yamada, Aoi's brother with an unusual resilience, and the feuding twins Youhei and Mitsuki Mashiba. Amidst the chaos, friendships deepen, new feelings emerge, and the restaurant somehow manages to serve its customers. Will Souta finally understand Mahiru's feelings? Or will Kyoko's past catch up with her? Join the Wagnaria family to find out!",
