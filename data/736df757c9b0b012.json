  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in the Onahama district of Iwaki, Fukushima, the anime centers around personified versions of two former Japanese navy destroyers, Shiokaze and Sawakaze. These ships had been scuttled after World War II to serve as breakwaters protecting Onahama Port. In 2011, the massive T≈çhoku earthquake ruptures the space-time continuum, opening a wormhole through which extraterrestrial creatures invade Earth. To defend their city from this otherworldly threat, Shiokaze and Sawakaze can transform into giant robots. They receive unexpected assistance from high school students, particularly an aspiring cyclist who rises to the challenge. Blending sci-fi, history, action and drama, the story plays out against the backdrop of Japan's 3/11 disasters while paying tribute to Fukushima's resilience. As the destroyers-turned-heroes fight to protect all they hold dear, they form powerful bonds with the community and inspire ordinary citizens to find courage within themselves.",
