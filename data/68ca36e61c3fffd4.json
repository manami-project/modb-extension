  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Old meets new in this captivating and visually rich anime series, which brings to life Japan's most beloved folk tales in an omnibus format. Each half-hour episode features two 10-minute shorts, with stories ranging from the timeless 'Momotaro' to 'The Moon Princess'. As Japan's second TV series by Group Tac and one of its longest-running, the show revolutionized anime by introducing a unique creative approach: rotating the staff for each episode to ensure a fresh and diverse look and feel.\n\nSpearheaded by the visionary director Sugii Gisaburo, this innovative concept allowed for a wide range of artistic styles and storytelling techniques, resulting in a visually stunning and engaging experience. With a roster of talented veterans like Group Tac founder Sugii Gisaburo, Shibayama Tsutomu, Furuzawa Hideo, Rin Taro, and Hikone Norio, the series offers a delightful mix of quality episodes that remain rewarding and entertaining.\n\nThough production of new episodes ceased in late 1995, the series' enduring appeal continues to captivate audiences, making it a must-watch for both anime enthusiasts and those with a passion for Japanese culture and folklore.",
