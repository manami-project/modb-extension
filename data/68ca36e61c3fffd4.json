  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese Folk Tales is a long-running anime series adapting beloved children's folk tales from Japan. Consisting of self-contained 10-minute shorts compiled into half-hour episodes, the series brings to life classic stories like Momotaro and The Moon Princess with a unique visual style that changes from episode to episode. The key concept behind Japanese Folk Tales was creative variety - each episode had a completely different production staff, allowing for dramatically different art styles, direction and storytelling with every tale. This innovative format kept the series fresh even across its exceptionally long run of over 25 years. With anime legends like director Sugii Gisaburo and a rotating cast of veteran creators involved, Japanese Folk Tales became known for both its diversity and occasional moments of breathtaking animation. Though the short format and creative rotation produced inconsistent quality at times, the series was genuinely rewarding overall. Visually, Japanese Folk Tales remains one of the richest anime productions in history. As the years passed, older episodes were repeated more frequently and new tales became rare, until production quietly ended in 1995. But the beloved anthology series left an impressive legacy, and its folk tale adaptations continue to be broadcast widely even today.",
