    "text": "In the heart of Ikebukuro, amidst the chaos, Shinra Kishitani, an underground doctor, and his beloved Celty Sturluson, seize the opportunity for a brief escape. Eager to devote his full attention to Celty, Shinra even dismisses calls from his close friend, Izaya Orihara. However, their peaceful getaway is persistently interrupted by attempts from Ikebukuro's residents to contact them. As Shinra delightfully indulges in nostalgia during a carriage ride with Celty, she senses an unfamiliar presence, hinting at an impending disruption to their romantic trip.\n\nThis special episode, titled 'Episode 13.5', unfolds between the events of episodes 13 and 14. It brings to life a riveting story segment from the seventh volume of Ryohgo Narita's original novel series, revealing a shocking incident that takes place during Celty and Shinra's time together. Initially aired in theatres, this episode promises a thrilling narrative that weaves seamlessly into the existing storyline.",
