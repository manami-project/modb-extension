    "text": "Chiba prefecture, Taisho-era Japan: the backdrop for a tale of love, resilience, and self-discovery. Tamahiko Shima, a 17-year-old from a wealthy family, finds his world shattered when an accident leaves him with a disabled right hand and robs him of his mother. Banished to the countryside to avoid bringing shame to his family, Tamahiko wallows in despair, feeling abandoned and worthless.\n\nOne snowy night, his solitary existence is disrupted by the arrival of Yuzuki Tachibana, a young girl who introduces herself as his bride-to-be, sent by his father to help him navigate his daily life. Despite the initial shock, Tamahiko gradually warms up to Yuzuki's cheerful disposition and boundless optimism, which stand in stark contrast to his own pessimism.\n\nAs the two learn to coexist, Tamahiko begins to understand the true value of cherishing someone and realizes that his life still holds meaning. Yuzuki's sunny presence illuminates the dark corners of his world, helping him heal and grow. Together, they navigate the challenges of their newfound relationship amidst the broader context of 1920s Japan, discovering love and self-worth along the way.",
