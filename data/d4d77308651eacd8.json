  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While Earth recovers from catastrophic environmental damage, humanity is confined to dome-shaped cities known as Domepolises. In a remote Siberian Domepolis, an expert gamer named Gainer Sanga spends his days dominating virtual competitions. However, his life takes an unexpected turn when he is falsely accused of being involved in the Exodus, a rebellious movement seeking to escape the iron grip of the ruling powers and return to the mythical land of Yapan.\n\nForced into an unlikely alliance with a seasoned mercenary named Gain Bijou, Gainer discovers an enigmatic Overman, a powerful mecha that he christens \"King Gainer\" after his gaming alias. Together, they embark on a daring journey to protect the Exodus movement, even as Gainer grapples with the painful memories of his parents, who were killed for their anti-Exodus stance.\n\nAs they traverse the harsh Siberian landscape, Gainer and Gain face formidable adversaries in the form of rival Overmen and the relentless Siberian Railway Patrol forces, hell-bent on thwarting their escape. With his gaming skills put to the ultimate test, Gainer must navigate the complexities of a world beyond the virtual realm and fight for the freedom of those yearning to reclaim their lost paradise.",
