  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kondou's relentless pursuit has finally paid off as Otae agrees to marry him, leaving Shinpachi Shimura stunned upon his return to Edo after a one-year hiatus. The city he once knew has undergone drastic changes, with its inhabitants transformed in both appearance and personality. Even his fellow Yorozuya members, Sakata Gintoki and Kagura, have become unrecognizable. In search of a place to belong, Shinpachi joins the Shinsengumi, only to find that they too have undergone bizarre transformations. However, Vice Chief Toushirou Hijikata remains unchanged, and together with Shinpachi, they set out to uncover the dark secret behind the city's sudden shift. As they embark on their mission, the Yorozuya team continues to take on odd jobs and navigate the alien-filled world of Edo, with their signature brand of humor and tongue-in-cheek parodies. Will they be able to restore Edo to its former state, or will they succumb to the strange new reality that surrounds them? Only time will tell in this latest installment of Gintama'.",
