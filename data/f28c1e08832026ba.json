    "text": "Despite his energetic demeanor, Misaki Yata's reckless and immature behavior has alienated him from his peers, while Saruhiko Fushimi's pessimistic worldview stems from his dysfunctional family, particularly his eccentric father, Niki. Despite their stark contrasts, Yata's infectious enthusiasm manages to break through Fushimi's walls, forging an unlikely yet strong friendship. However, as they grow weary of their mundane lives, the duo finds themselves venturing into the chaotic and perilous realm of the Dresden Slate.",
