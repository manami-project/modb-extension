    "text": "Misaki Yata is an energetic but reckless youth who is shunned by his classmates for his immaturity. Saruhiko Fushimi is a loner from a dysfunctional family, especially due to his eccentric father Niki, leaving him with a pessimistic worldview. Despite their differences, Yata's enthusiasm breaks through Fushimi's barriers and the two become best friends. However, they eventually grow restless with their small world, leading them to enter the dangerous realm surrounding the Dresden Slate. As polar opposites, Yata and Fushimi find friendship against the odds. But will their bond survive the turbulent forces they unwittingly step into? Their relationship faces its greatest test yet as they navigate the perilous influences of the Dresden Slate.",
