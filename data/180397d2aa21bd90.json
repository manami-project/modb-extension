  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Alba, Ein, Zwei, and the rest of their adventurous group are back for more hilarious escapades in the second season of the anime. When Alba gets falsely accused of \"murdering\" FoyFoy, and Hime-chan's armor gets turned into a flower pot, there's never a dull moment with this chaotic crew. Meanwhile, a vast conspiracy emerges that threatens both the Demon and Human Worlds, with traitors and betrayers on all sides vying for power. The Demons aim to restore their Demon King, while the Human King wants to be the one to defeat him. Caught in the middle is Alba, self-proclaimed hero extraordinaire, still dishing out his signature elegant retorts three months later. But when a hole opens between worlds and monsters flood out, Alba and his sadistic soldier friend Ross must try to stop the resurrection of the demon lord Rukimedes. Though separated, the duo persists in their heroic antics to save the day, even as a sinister ghost from Rossâ€™ past returns to potentially upend their efforts.",
