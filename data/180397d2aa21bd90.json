The self-proclaimed hero, Alba Fr√ºhling, and his eclectic group of allies - including the mischievous Ein, the enigmatic Zwei, and the feisty Ruki - find themselves in a series of misadventures, from being framed for 'murder' to dealing with transformed armor.

In this liminal space, he encounters the demon lord Rukimedes, who appears surprisingly comfortable in his confinement. Despite being separated, Ross and Alba remain steadfast in their mission to prevent the demon lord's resurgence. However, a specter from Ross' past could jeopardize their entire endeavor.\n\nIn this thrilling continuation, prepare for a rollercoaster ride of laughter, betrayal, and unexpected camaraderie as our heroes navigate through a world filled with chaos and conspiracy.
