    "text": "In the heart of Kyoto, Daijirou Kyogoku, the 15th in line of a distinguished sweets shop legacy, Amashoudou, stumbles upon an extraordinary secret hidden beneath his shop. A colossal robot, Doamaiger D, lies dormant in the basement, waiting to be discovered. As fate would have it, the tranquility of Kyoto is disrupted by the emergence of destructive Mekaijuu, a menacing fusion of mecha and kaiju.\n\nTo restore peace, Daijirou must harness the power of Doamaiger D, a mech with an unusual talent for crafting confections. As the city grapples with the onslaught of these mechanical monstrosities, our hero finds himself in a unique predicament. The key to vanquishing these foes and returning them to their human form lies in the sweet creations he can whip up using his candy-making mech.\n\nAs Daijirou delves deeper into the origins of Doamaiger D, he uncovers a sinister plot orchestrated by an American sweets tycoon, Mr. Robert, who employs his own giant robot to automate sweets production. Brace yourself for a thrilling, retro-style adventure that combines the excitement of giant robot battles with the delicate art of traditional Japanese confectionery.",
