  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hina Inn's tranquility is disrupted by the unexpected arrival of Motoko's estranged sister, who wields a katana with grace and skill. Ready to hand over the family dojo, the elder sister challenges Motoko to prove her worthiness as a successor. However, Motoko's strength falls short of her sister's expectations, leading to an ultimatum: Motoko must either triumph over her sister in combat or enter into a marriage with Keitaro.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Keitaro, who had just bid farewell to Naru and Mei at the train station, finds himself saved by the very same katana-wielding sister. Caught off guard by her sudden appearance, Motoko impulsively declares that she cannot return to the dojo due to her impending nuptials with Keitaro. To maintain this ruse and prevent Motoko's return, Keitaro and the other Hina Inn girls must now convincingly portray a romantic relationship. Yet, with Motoko's inability to even share a simple kiss with Keitaro without resorting to violence, the success of their charade hangs in the balance.",
