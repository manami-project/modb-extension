  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tama Elder invites Kokoro and her Cocotama friends to the Cocotama World, a place where tiny gods, born from the thoughts and feelings of cherished objects, reside. These apprentice gods, identifiable by their egg-underwear, use mysterious magic to aid humans in finding lost items, though they often make mistakes. As Kokoro and her friends explore the world of full-fledged Cocotama gods, they are tasked with helping humans appreciate the value of their belongings instead of discarding them.\n\nHowever, their visit takes an unexpected turn when Tepple, a new friend, steals a key acorn that unlocks the Happy Tree, the source of magic for the Cocotama World. The acorn's absence leads to a rift of darkness and an infestation of mushrooms, born from the sadness of discarded items, that emit negative energy affecting both humans and Cocotama.\n\nAs Happy Stars, the essence of magic, begin draining into the human world, Kokoro and the Cocotama must heal Tepple's heart and retrieve the acorn before the darkness consumes both worlds. With the bazaar at Kokoro's school as the backdrop, the Cocotama gang embarks on a mission to save both their world and the human realm.",
