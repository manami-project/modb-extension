  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a distant future where humanity has spread across the stars and colonized planets across the galaxy, peace and order is maintained by the Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs (GOTT). However, economic disputes still arise between planets looking to prosper. To secretly resolve these tensions, GOTT has an elite covert unit known as the ES Force. ES members Eclair and Lumiere are two young female agents with special abilities who take on high stakes missions. After defeating terrorists who attacked GOTT headquarters, their task is to escort an auditor to oversee negotiations between two planets on the brink of economic war. But as Eclair and Lumiere carry out their duties, they uncover that there are larger forces manipulating events behind the scenes. They realize GOTT has an hidden agenda beyond what they were led to believe. As agents traversing the stars, Eclair and Lumiere find themselves questioning everything they know in their struggle to bring peace to the galaxy.",
