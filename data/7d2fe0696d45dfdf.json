    "text": "Only fifteen, Maia Mizuki's dreams of joining the elite Ocean Agency, a paramilitary organization that governs the future water-covered Earth, are shattered when she fails the entrance exams. With her hopes crushed, Maia's life takes a turn for the worse as she finds herself evicted, penniless, and alone. In the midst of a chaotic shootout between bank robbers and two women from Nereids, a private detective agency known for its unconventional methods, Maia is saved and offered a job with the agency.\n\nNow a part of Nereids, Maia's life becomes a series of unexpected adventures, from chasing stray cats to capturing wanted criminals. Alongside her fellow Nereids members, Rena, Shizuka, Gloria, and Yu, Maia balances her new life of fighting crime while still holding onto her dreams of joining the Ocean Agency. As she navigates her new life, Maia becomes entangled in a subplot involving the mysterious \"Daphne,\" which eventually becomes crucial to her future. In this world of brilliant blue oceans, vast water expanses, floating cities, and scarce land, Maia's journey is just beginning.",
