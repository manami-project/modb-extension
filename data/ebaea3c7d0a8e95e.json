    "text": "Inarva and Pharm, two Valhalla Princesses, shake up the routine at the Tokino bathhouse with their arrival. Pharm takes over the school's clock tower and turns every girl into a bespectacled maiden, while Inarva sends everyone to the â€˜Punishment Dimension' for minor offenses. Inarva also brings news of Kazuto's impending marriage to Valkyrie on the Celestial Soul's day, but before the wedding, they must pass the trial of the twin demons and gather the scattered Stellar Stones. Meanwhile, Raine and Chorus settle into their new Earth home, and the last three Valhalla princesses share their tales. Amidst these events, Kazuto and Valkyrie strive to maintain their adult forms and prepare for their second attempt at marriage, adding to the lively chaos of their everyday lives.",
