  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the ongoing adventures of Kazuto, Valkyrie, and the other \"Valhalla Princesses\" from the alien world of Valhalla. In the latest installments, two more princesses arrive on Earth - Pharm, who transforms all the schoolgirls into bespectacled maidens from her lair in the clocktower, and Inarva, who banishes people to the \"Punishment Dimension\" for minor infractions. Inarva brings important news - Kazuto and Valkyrie are to be married on the Celestial Soul's Day in three months! But first, they must pass the trial of the twin demons and retrieve the twelve Stellar Stones scattered around town. Overcoming self-doubt and demonic trials, can the couple finally make it down the aisle? Elsewhere, Raine and Chorus get a house on Earth, while the other princesses have their own humorous tales to tell. And when Kazuto and Valkyrie manage to maintain their adult forms, they make another attempt at marriage. Though the stories jump around, one thing stays constant - hijinks and hilarity with the Valhalla gang!",
