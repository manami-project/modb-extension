Dee Latener, one half of the duo, harbors deep feelings for his partner, Ryo Maclane, and sees this as the perfect opportunity to deepen their relationship. However, their plans for a romantic getaway are abruptly halted when they stumble upon a series of unsolved murders targeting individuals of Japanese descent. As the body count rises, the pair must navigate their complex feelings for each other while working to solve the case before Ryo, who is half-Japanese, becomes the next target. To complicate matters further, their foster son, Bikky, and an unwelcome colleague, J.J., unexpectedly join them at the hotel, adding to the chaos and tension. Will Latener and Maclane be able to balance their personal lives with their professional duties and solve the case before it's too late? Only time will tell.",
