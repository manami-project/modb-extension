    "text": "Land of Wano's legendary swordsman, Ryuma, finds himself in a tumultuous world plagued by an ominous dragon wreaking havoc in \"MONSTERS: 103 Mercies Dragon Damnation\" by Eiichiro Oda. As a wandering samurai, Ryuma crosses paths with a compassionate waitress, Flair, whose village was once destroyed by a dragon. Despite seeking a peaceful existence, trouble ensues when Ryuma challenges the local sword master, Shirano, who once battled a dragon and saved Flair from the ruins.\n\nYears ago, the mysterious Dragon's Horn was stolen, leading to the massacre of its guards. Now, the dragon terrorizes the land once more, and Ryuma encounters the enigmatic DR, who believes the samurai seeks the Dragon's Horn. Summoning the dragon with the horn, DR triggers panic among the villagers. Upon hearing the news, Shirano feels duty-bound to protect the village and confront the dragon once more.\n\nRyuma, entangled in the catastrophic events surrounding the dragon's horn and the dragon's devastating appearance, must navigate this perilous world. As a secondary character from \"One Piece,\" this story delves into Ryuma's past and the trials he faces in a world besieged by monstrous forces.",
