  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The series is set in Edoropolis, a city fusing traditional Japanese and modern cultures, populated by anthropomorphic animal robots called \"animaloids\". Officially led by eccentric Shogun Tokugawa, actual power lies with his daughter Princess Usako and a council headed by ambitious Prime Minister Kitsunezuka. Kitsunezuka secretly plots with his advisor Karasu and army leader Karamaru to overthrow the Shogun. Council member Inuyama discovers the treasonous plot but cannot prosecute due to Kitsunezuka's deniability. So Inuyama recruits Yattarou, Pururun, Sukashii, and Otama, four cat ninja warriors working undercover at a pizzeria, to thwart the scheme. These \"Nyankii\" fight various threats to Edoropolis, including Kitsunezuka's henchmen as they carry out plans to seize power. The Nyankii must balance running their pizza restaurant cover while battling injustice as high-tech samurai, launching into action from a giant gun emerging from their shop. Kitsunezuka's corrupt rule spreads chaos, so the feline warriors' mission is to take down evildoers and protect the city they love.",
