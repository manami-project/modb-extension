    "text": "Demon lords, succubi, and heroes collide in the unlikeliest of places: under the same roof! Meet Basara Toujou, a high school student whose ordinary life takes a dramatic turn when his father remarries and brings home two beautiful step-sisters, Mio and Maria Naruse. Unbeknownst to Basara, Mio and Maria are far from ordinary girls; they're a future Demon Lord and a succubus, respectively. As if that weren't enough, Basara hails from a lineage of heroic demon fighters, a secret he must keep hidden.\n\nThings get complicated when Mio and Maria attempt to enslave Basara, only for the tables to turn in a twist of fate, making him their master instead! With a demon lord, a succubus, and a demon-fighting hero living together, life becomes a series of ecchi misadventures and unexpected bonds. But danger looms as Mio's life is threatened by demons and heroes alike. Will Basara be able to protect his newfound family and navigate the treacherous world of demons and heroes, all while concealing his own dark secret? Join Basara, Mio, and Maria as they forge an unbreakable bond and face the challenges that lie ahead.",
