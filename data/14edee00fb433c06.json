    "text": "For Nanami Takahashi, the start of high school brings the promise of new friendships and perhaps even love. Among the chatter of her classmates, one name stands out - Yano Motoharu, the charismatic basketball star with a mysterious past. Initially dismissive of his popularity, Nanami finds herself drawn to Yano after a series of encounters, despite his enigmatic demeanor. As they navigate the complexities of their budding relationship, the shadow of Yano's past looms large, threatening to overshadow their bond. With Yano grappling to open up about his past heartbreak, Nanami remains steadfast, determined to understand and support him. But as misunderstandings and heartache challenge their love, will Nanami and Yano's bond survive, or will it crumble under the weight of their shared past?",
