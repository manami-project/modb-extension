    "text": "Nanami Takahashi is an incoming high school freshman filled with excitement about making new friends. She meets Yuri Yamamoto, a shy classmate, who tells her about Yano Motoharu - an aloof yet popular boy in their class. Yuri harbors resentment towards Yano due to his past relationship with her older sister Nana, who tragically passed away in a car accident. Initially, Nanami also disapproves of Yano's standoffish nature. However, after several chance encounters, she begins developing feelings for him. The two eventually start dating, but Yano struggles to open up emotionally as he still grieves Nana. As Nanami and Yano attempt to nurture their budding relationship, they find themselves haunted by the specter of Yano's intense first love. Their path forward seems filled with potential misunderstandings and heartbreak. Yet, in spite of the challenges, Nanami and Yano still cling to the hope that their love can prevail if only they can save each other from past hurts.",
