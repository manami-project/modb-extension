  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime centers around Ataru, an unlucky and forgetful young man who finds himself in an unexpected arranged marriage. Over a decade ago when Ataru was a child, he played a game called \"Shadow Tag\" with a young alien princess named Elle. By stepping on her shadow, he inadvertently became engaged to her due to the customs of her planet. Now, years later, Elle has returned to Earth to claim Ataru as her husband. She brings along a whole royal entourage and a force field to prevent Ataru's fiery girlfriend Lum from interfering. Lum is furious when she finds out and immediately begins plotting ways to stop the wedding plans. Her alien friend Benten even suggests they stage a competing wedding and abduct Ataru themselves. As Ataru grapples with his forgotten promise to Elle, Lum resorts to increasingly extreme measures to keep Ataru for herself. It seems that Ataru is destined to marry one of these two alien princesses, whether he wants to or not. Their battle over his affections leads to chaos, electric shocks, and intergalactic-level drama. Ultimately, Ataru must make a choice - but will he pick duty by honoring his accidental proposal to Elle, or follow his heart toward the hot-tempered Lum? This comedic sci-fi romance anime promises laughter, action, and no shortage of extraterrestrial marital madness.",
