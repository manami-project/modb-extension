    "text": "Alien princesses, childhood promises, and intergalactic weddings collide in this thrilling anime! Ataru, a man known for his misfortune, finds himself in hot water when he receives a wedding invitation that doesn't list his beloved Lum as the bride. Instead, the bride-to-be is Elle, a mysterious girl he played 'Shadow Tag' with 11 years ago. Unbeknownst to Ataru, winning this game on Elle's planet signifies a marriage proposal.\n\nNow, Elle is back with an entire army to enforce this forgotten promise. But Lum, Ataru's electrically-charged love interest, isn't ready to give up on her man without a fight. With the help of her friend Benten, Lum plans a pre-emptive wedding, abducting Ataru and all the guests. Meanwhile, Elle prepares to bring Ataru to her home planet, setting the stage for a cosmic showdown and a shotgun wedding like no other! Will Ataru end up with his childhood sweetheart or will Lum's high-voltage love prevail?",
