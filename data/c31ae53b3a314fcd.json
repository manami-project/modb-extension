  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Beast ly antics of marine creatures unfold in the vast expanse of the ocean, as a polar bear grapples with ennui in this animated short film. Drawing inspiration from the 12th-13th century Japanese picture scroll \"Bird and Beast Character Caricature,\" this modern take on an ancient tradition brings forth 'Frolicking Sea Animals' in a delightful and whimsical manner. With clever wordplay that intertwines Japanese and English, the film captures the thoughts and lives of various marine animals through short, rhythmic poems. The polar bear's boredom, encapsulated in the phrase 'Hokyoku-Guma Suggoku Hima,' and the pitiful otter's tale, 'Kawauso Kawaisou,' are just a couple of examples of the linguistic fun that awaits viewers. Debuting at the 39th Flickers' Rhode Island International Film Festival during the 'KIDSEYE FILM FESTIVAL - ANIMATED SHORTS' on August 14, 2021, this one-scene, one-cut, 7-minute film promises a unique and engaging experience for all ages.",
