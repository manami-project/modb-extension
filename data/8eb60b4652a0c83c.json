Shu soon discovers the Talispod can summon powerful monsters called Legendz from Soul Dolls. However, the evil Dark Wiz Toy Company seeks Shu's Talispod, as it has the unique ability to revive real Legendz, not just digital projections. After being chased by Dark Wiz lackeys, Shu receives a Windragon Legendz named Shiron from the skies to aid him. Now, together with his friends who have also obtained Legendz, Shu must fend off Dark Wiz's pursuit and locate the remaining Soul Dolls while preventing an impending war and destruction. Through exciting battles alongside their Legendz companions, Shu and his friends take a stand against Dark Wiz's nefarious plans. Their courage and loyalty to each other is tested as they unravel the mysteries behind the Legendz and the true purpose of Shu's special Talispod.",
