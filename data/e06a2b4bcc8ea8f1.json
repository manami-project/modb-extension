  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime opens with a special OVA episode, packaged alongside the tenth volume of the manga. Our protagonist, Elsie, a devil hailing from hell, is assigned a mission by her superior, Dokurou Skull, the formidable head of hell's 'counter measures' division. Her task? To venture to Earth and apprehend malevolent spirits that have daringly fled from the clutches of Tartarus.\n\nOriginally tasked with cleaning duties, Elsie vows to her boss that she will strive to fulfill her new role without bringing shame to hell. This brief episode serves as a prelude to the main anime series, \"The World God Only Knows\".\n\nMeanwhile, at the Law Enforcement Bureau, Dokurou Skull and his dedicated team are tirelessly tracking down wayward souls. Elsie, characteristically tardy, arrives amidst the chaos, curious about the rumors circulating about a human with the uncanny ability to capture the heart of any woman.",
