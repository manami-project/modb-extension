    "text": "The anime begins with a short prologue episode focused on Elsie, a young demon girl working in hell. Elsie is summoned by her boss Docrow Skull, the chief of the Law Enforcement Bureau's countermeasures division. He assigns her an important mission - to travel to Earth and recapture dangerous spirits that have escaped from hell. Originally a cleaner in hell, Elsie is inexperienced but eager to prove herself. She vows not to disgrace hell and promises Docrow she will fulfill her duty. Meanwhile, the Law Enforcement Bureau is already hard at work tracking down the lost souls. Intrigued, Elsie asks Docrow about rumors she has heard - rumors concerning a human man on Earth with the incredible and mysterious ability to capture any woman's heart. This short episode sets the stage for Elsie's adventures to come as she heads to Earth and crosses paths with this rumored young man.",
