    "text": "It follows the journey of a monk named Xuanzang, who sets out to retrieve the Mahayana Buddhist scriptures from western India. Along the way, Xuanzang encounters and aids Sun Wukong, a mischievous entity trapped within a rock by Guanyin. Upon his release, Sun Wukong becomes Xuanzang's disciple and aids him on his quest. They encounter a pig monster attacking a girl, whom Sun Wukong subdues, and the pig becomes another disciple named Zhu Bajie. A water imp, renamed Sha Wujing, also joins their group.\n\nWhen Sun Wukong captures a monster and hurls a ball obtained from it, a snow-capped holy mountain appears, housing the Ho-den hall pagoda where the scriptures are kept. Upon meeting Tathagata Buddha, Xuanzang requests the sacred scriptures. Nyorai-sama reveals that the scriptures will be delivered via a dragon cart. This captivating anime blends adventure, spirituality, and camaraderie, promising a unique and engaging experience for viewers.",
