  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As whispers of a new Holy Grail emerge in the American city of Snowfield, a fresh wave of Mages and their legendary Heroic Spirits prepare for an epic showdown. In this ruthless battle, the victor is promised a single wish granted by the omnipotent Grail. However, this time, something seems amiss. The Mage's Association in London suspects that this war is but a pale imitation of the Third Holy Grail War, with the lines between Masters and Servants blurred.\n\nEnter Flatt Escardos, a young apprentice to Lord El-Melloi II, a veteran of the Fourth Holy Grail War. Defying his master's wishes, Flatt joins the ranks of the Masters in Snowfield, now a city on the brink of chaos. As the war unfolds, strange occurrences abound: a missing Servant class, impossible summonings, and a nation cloaked in secrecy.\n\nIn this twisted game of power and deception, the true nature of the Holy Grail is questioned. Is it a genuine artifact, or a mere puppet in someone's grand scheme? As the curtain rises on this masquerade of heroes and humans, the stage is set for a Holy Grail War shrouded in lies and manipulation.",
