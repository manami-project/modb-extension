    "text": "With a future plagued by overpopulation, the finger points to an unlikely culprit: Junta, an ordinary young man from the past with an extraordinary destiny. Dubbed the Mega-Playboy, Junta is fated to father a multitude of children, each inheriting his irresistible charm. To prevent this catastrophic future, Karin, a time-traveling agent, is dispatched to neutralize Junta's burgeoning powers with a custom-made bullet.\n\nHowever, Junta's peculiar affliction complicates Karin's mission: he becomes violently ill at the mere hint of anything sexual. Amidst this conundrum, Karin finds herself unwittingly triggering Junta's transformation into the Mega-Playboy, sparking a whirlwind of romantic chaos. As hordes of smitten girls flock to Junta, Karin must navigate a tangled web of jealous rivals, confused friends, and her own budding feelings for Junta.\n\nIn this uproarious tale of love and mishaps, Junta's life takes a dramatic turn, transforming him from an allergy-ridden adolescent into the most sought-after bachelor. As Karin struggles to balance her mission and her heart, one question remains: can she stop the Mega-Playboy, or will she fall under his spell?",
