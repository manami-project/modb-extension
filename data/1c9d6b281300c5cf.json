  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Issei and the members of the Occult Research Club as they have various lighthearted misadventures and comedic situations. Several stories involve the characters ending up in compromising scenarios where they show more skin than usual, played for laughs. Other tales feature magical mishaps like Koneko's personality getting accidentally reversed, making her uncharacteristically promiscuous. Though mainly episodic fun lacking an overarching plot, the shorts offer more insight into the relationships and quirks of Issei and his demon friends. With glimpses of fanservice and fantasy elements sprinkled throughout this eclectic mix of humorous shorts, viewers can enjoy seeing another side of the characters they know and love.",
