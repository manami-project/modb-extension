  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, Princess Millhiore of the Republic of Biscotti, a nation populated by dog-like humanoids, finds herself in a dire situation. The neighboring feline kingdom of Galette Leo Knights has launched an attack, pushing Biscotti to the brink of collapse. In a desperate attempt to save her kingdom, Millhiore summons a hero from another world. To her surprise, the hero that appears is not a mighty warrior, but an ordinary junior high school student from Earth named Cinque Izumi.\n\nIn this alternate world of Flonyard, wars are not fought with bloodshed, but rather as sports competitions to raise funds for the participating kingdoms. Cinque, an aspiring athlete, is well-suited to this environment and agrees to help Princess Millhiore and the Republic of Biscotti. He is given a sacred weapon, the Palladion, which can transform into any weapon he imagines.\n\nCinque quickly proves himself as a formidable champion, but soon discovers that there is a catch: once a hero is summoned, they cannot return to their home world. As the scientists of Biscotti work to find a way to send Cinque back home, he continues to fight as Biscotti's hero and serve Princess Millhiore. Will Cinque be able to adapt to this new world and find a way back home, or will he forever remain a hero in this magical land of animal-eared inhabitants?",
