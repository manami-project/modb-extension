  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Eripiyo is an energetic superfan devoted to supporting the fledgling idol group Cham Jam. After receiving a flyer from the shy member Maina Ichii, Eripiyo attends a local Cham Jam concert and immediately falls in love with Maina's performance. From that point on, Eripiyo dedicates herself to being Maina's number one fan, following the underground group to all their small venues with unwavering enthusiasm. Clad in her signature red tracksuit, Eripiyo's charismatic presence at Cham Jam's shows soon earns her recognition as Maina's unrivaled cheerleader. During one show, Eripiyo's passion overwhelms her and she gets a dramatic nosebleed. Yet not even injuries or Maina's seemingly cold shoulder will deter Eripiyo from pursuing her dream of seeing Cham Jam perform at the prestigious Budoukan music hall in Tokyo. Through her infectious energy and steadfast support, Eripiyo hopes to motivate her beloved idol to reach for stardom.",
