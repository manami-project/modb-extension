    "text": "ChamJam—and its shy, reserved member Maina Ichii—have captured the heart of Eripiyo, turning her into their most devoted fan. Eripiyo's life takes a new turn when she witnesses Maina's performance at a local concert, and from that moment, she becomes an unstoppable force in supporting the rising idol. Known for her striking red tracksuit, Eripiyo attends every event and performance, even in the most remote locations, to cheer on her beloved idol.\n\nDespite facing an injury and Maina's seemingly cold demeanor, Eripiyo's enthusiasm never wavers. Her unwavering dedication to Maina even leads to an intense nosebleed during one performance, but that doesn't deter her. Eripiyo's dream is to see Maina perform at the prestigious Budoukan arena, and she'll go to any length to make that happen. This is the story of a passionate music lover and her journey to help her favorite underground idol reach the pinnacle of success.",
