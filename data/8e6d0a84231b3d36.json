    "text": "This engaging anime follows the story of Takasumi Takane, an ambitious 11-year-old boy eager to secure a new bicycle by scoring within the top 100 on his exams. However, when he falls short of his goal, Takane resorts to deceit, claiming a rank of 92nd and destroying the evidence of his actual results. Frustration mounts as he damages his sister Tamaki's hand-me-down bicycle and faces accusations of lying from both his mother and sister.\n\nOne fateful night, while searching for his missing dog Chris at a shrine, Takane encounters a peculiar young man named Yoyogi. In possession of the answer sheet marked \"92nd,\" Yoyogi presents Takane with a tempting offer: in exchange for something he no longer needs, Takane can have the coveted test score. In a moment of desperation, Takane offers up his sister Tamaki.\n\nAs Tamaki arrives on the scene and is transformed into a shining object by Yoyogi, Takane realizes his mistake and vows to save her. With the stakes high, Yoyogi challenges Takane to a race on his broken bicycle, promising to restore Tamaki if he wins. Can Takane triumph in this thrilling race and rescue his sister?",
