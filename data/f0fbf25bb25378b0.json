  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Set in a futuristic Japan in the year 2093, this anime tells the tale of a rural seaside town that once thrived as a prestigious hub but now lies submerged 30 meters under the ocean surface. At the story's core is a young girl who discovers the lost sunken town and becomes fascinated with the art of freediving. As she explores the eerie underwater ruins, her emotional journey parallels her growing passion for diving ever deeper without equipment, pushing the limits of the human capacity to hold one's breath. Through the freediver girl's eyes, the anime offers a poignant perspective on the inevitable erosion of even the greatest human achievements over time. Yet it also celebrates the resilience of the human spirit, as the protagonist discovers hope and emotional growth in the town's watery remains. Her journey speaks to the ability of the young generation to find meaning and beauty where their forebears saw only tragedy in the wake of loss. At once melancholic and uplifting, this anime promises a visually stunning aquatic landscape as the backdrop for a stirring coming-of-age story about pushing boundaries, grappling with transience, and finding light in the depths of despair. Immersive freediving sequences and sumptuous visuals beckon viewers to dive in and discover the timeless majesty hidden beneath the tides of time.",
