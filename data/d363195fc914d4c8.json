But when Mira, the ruthless lieutenant of the enemy forces, crosses paths with Mimori, he finds himself unexpectedly captivated by the very person he's meant to defeat.\n\nMira, born and raised in the service of a merciless ruler, has clawed his way to the top of the hierarchy through sheer determination and cunning. Yet, his unwavering loyalty wavers when he encounters Mimori, the beautiful adversary he can't help but admire. Instead of engaging in combat, he finds himself showering her with gifts, creating a unique bond between them.\n\nFor Mimori, life as an orphan has been fraught with hardships. To safeguard her orphanage from financial ruin, she assumes the role of a Magical Girl, only to discover she's been duped into serving the very enemy she once fought against. Amidst the chaos and deception, her interactions with Mira, the enigmatic enemy commander, become her only solace.\n\nAs they navigate the tumultuous waters of their shared predicament, will their budding affection survive the turmoil of war, or will it succumb to the very forces that brought them together?",
