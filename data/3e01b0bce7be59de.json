Sakata, the scatterbrained student, arrives late with breakfast still in his mouth, while Shima makes a grand entrance by falling from the ceiling with an elaborate stage setup. Senra, on the other hand, secures a quiet seat before anyone else even arrives.\n\nWith such fierce competition, can Urata and his Tanuki keep up? Will they become friends or foes with their fellow transfer students? This heart-racing youth story follows the adventures of these four high school students as they navigate the ups and downs of school life. Get ready for a wild ride filled with laughter, drama, and unforgettable memories!",
