  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a surprising turn of events, the Earth finds itself under siege by an extraterrestrial race, the Heterodyne, after a dozen years of peace. To counter this threat, the 21st Century Security Corporation had previously commissioned a colossal robot, Dai-Guard. However, with the Heterodyne's abrupt disappearance, Dai-Guard was relegated to a mere marketing spectacle, gathering dust in a theme park.\n\nNow, as the Heterodyne resurface, an unlikely trio of corporate employees from the marketing department find themselves in the cockpit of the neglected robot. Akagi, the impetuous one, Ibuki, the steadfast friend, and Aoyama, the refined colleague, must navigate Dai-Guard's outdated technology to protect their world.\n\nWith corporate profit margins in mind, the company seizes the opportunity to form a new sub-unit within the marketing department, tasked with defending Japan using Dai-Guard. Balancing their office jobs and newfound roles as Earth's defenders, these salarymen strive to prove that even the most ordinary individuals can rise to extraordinary challenges. The stage is set for an engaging tale of camaraderie, courage, and corporate responsibility in the face of alien invasion.",
