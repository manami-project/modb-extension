  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They say ignorance is bliss, but not for Ura and Riko, the last vestiges of curiosity in a world that has all but given up on its past. In a dystopian future where the Earth has been ravaged by humanity, the remnants of mankind eke out a mechanical existence in the chasm between the desolate lower level and the enigmatic sky above. As part of the Archive Excavation Department, Ura and Riko toil away to restore the shattered memories of a world long lost. Amidst the endless ruins and archives, Ura stumbles upon a cryptic video, a relic from a time when oceans and continents still thrived. As they delve deeper into the mysteries of the past, they may uncover more than they bargained for, shaking the very foundations of their dreary existence and challenging the status quo of their artificial reality. Join Ura and Riko as they embark on a journey that could change everything they know about their world and the misery that led them to it.",
