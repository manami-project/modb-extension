Meanwhile, a Saiyan named Paragus arrives on Earth, seeking Vegeta's aid to defeat the same Super Saiyan. Paragus lures Vegeta to New Planet Vegeta under the pretense of crowning him king, with Goku's friends joining the journey. On the new planet, they encounter Paragus' volatile son, Broly, who is revealed to be the Legendary Super Saiyan they were searching for. As the Saiyan power struggle intensifies, Goku and Vegeta clash over who should confront the new threat. However, Broly's true intentions and his connection to Goku and Vegeta's past remain a mystery. With Broly's power reaching dangerous levels, the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance as Goku and his friends face their most formidable challenge yet. Will they be able to stop the Legendary Super Saiyan before it's too late?",
