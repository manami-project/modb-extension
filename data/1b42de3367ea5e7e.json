  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Despite its decline in popularity, the high school student Hiroshi Yuki finds himself drawn into the world of Kiwame Quest, a VRMMO renowned for its unparalleled realism. Released ten years ago, the game boasts an impressive 10 sexdecillion story branches and an uncanny replication of all senses and physical abilities, making it virtually indistinguishable from reality. However, this extreme realism comes at a cost, as players must possess the same physical prowess to complete quests as they would in real life, and any injuries sustained in-game are also felt in the real world. Despite the game's harsh conditions, Hiroshi becomes determined to conquer it, even if it means putting his own body on the line. With no respite from the game's relentless challenges, Hiroshi's only goal is to emerge victorious. The first episode of this thrilling adventure premiered on March 31, 2021, with regular TV broadcasts commencing on April 7, 2021.",
