  "synopsis": {
    "text": "From the tranquil surface of a frozen sea, to the boundless expanse of the sky, a mesmerizing spectacle unfolds in an anime where time seems to have come to a halt. An old man, accompanied by his feline companion, embarks on a journey across the crystalline seascape, as memories of the past are stirred. Amidst this timeless tableau, a majestic whale ascends from the depths, taking flight for what seems like an eternity. Hand-drawn with meticulous care, the whale, the people, and the ships stand in stark contrast to the stillness of the glassy ocean and glaciers, rendered in 3D computer graphics. As more onlookers gather to witness this awe-inspiring sight, the anime invites viewers into a realm of fantasy, where wonders abound â€“ from a leaping whale and a fallen star, to soaring fish waiting to be captured on canvas. This poetic masterpiece, born from an ambitious endeavor, offers a visual feast that beckons the imagination and stirs the soul.",
