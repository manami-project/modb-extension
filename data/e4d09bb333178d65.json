  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Suzu is an ordinary 18-year-old girl with a talent for sketching who lives on the outskirts of Hiroshima in the 1930s. In 1943, she enters into an arranged marriage and moves to the neighboring naval city of Kure to start a new life with her husband's family. As Suzu adjusts to married life, she faces many challenges and hardships, especially as the war intensifies. Yet she finds happiness in her daily routines. This extended version of the anime includes additional scenes expanding on Suzu's experiences during 1944 and 1945. We see more of her encounters with Rin, a prominent character, as well as a segment focusing on Suzu's concern for her younger sister Sumi during a destructive typhoon in September 1945. By depicting \"several more lives\" beyond just Suzu's perspective, the anime aims to provide a deeper look at civilian life in Japan leading up to and during World War II. Suzu's small but profound joys offer a message of perseverance and humanity even in difficult times.",
