    "text": "Ikutsumo no Katasumi ni\" is an extended edition of the acclaimed anime film \"In this Corner of the World,\" featuring additional footage and scenes adapted from the original manga. The story follows Suzu, a young woman with a talent for drawing, who leaves her quiet life in the outskirts of Hiroshima in the 1930s to marry a naval officer in the neighboring city of Kure. As World War II escalates, Suzu must navigate the challenges of her new life and family, while finding moments of joy and beauty amidst the hardships. The extended version includes new scenes featuring Suzu's encounters with Rin in the fall of 1944 and the winter and spring of 1945, as well as a segment focusing on the Makurazaki Typhoon of September 1945 and Suzu's concern for her younger sister Sumi. With its poignant portrayal of everyday life during wartime, \"Ikutsumo no Katasumi ni\" offers a unique and moving perspective on the human experience.",
