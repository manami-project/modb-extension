    "text": "Akira Kariya's raw athleticism and relentless determination on the school's athletic field captures the attention of Riku Haruma, a high school student with an uncertain future. Kariya's sport of choice is rugby, a game that Haruma once loved but abandoned due to his lack of physical prowess. As Haruma watches Kariya's unpolished play, he can't help but offer some advice, sparking a renewed passion for the sport within himself. Together, they form an unlikely duo, with Haruma's strategic mind complementing Kariya's brute strength. As they strive to reach the pinnacle of high school rugby, Haruma discovers a new purpose and a brighter future. \"Try Knights\" follows their journey, showcasing the importance of teamwork, leadership, and the pursuit of one's passions.",
