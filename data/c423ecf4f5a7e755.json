  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Riku Haruma begins high school aimless, until his attention is captured by Akira Kariya, a passionate rugby player with raw athletic talent. Though Riku once played rugby, he gave it up due to his small physique. As Akira practices, Riku notices room for improvement and offers advice. To Riku's surprise, his simple suggestions help Akira's game immediately. Riku realizes the school's struggling rugby team lacks strategic leadership despite having strong players like Akira. With his deeper knowledge of rugby tactics, Riku sees an opportunity to make a difference. His encounter with Akira rekindles Riku's long-dormant passion for the sport. Together, their contrasting skills and shared love of rugby form a connection that promises to take their team to new heights. This anime follows Riku as he works to sharpen the team's strategy and help players like Akira refine their powerful, aggressive style. Though an unlikely rugby player himself, Riku's guidance and passion galvanize the team and open up a hopeful future for Riku.",
