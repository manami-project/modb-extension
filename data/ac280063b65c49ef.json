    "text": "Yamasachi' and 'Umisachi'. These four animated episodes, directed by Yamamura Kouji, are based on the ancient Japanese chronicle, Kojiki, which dates back to 712 and narrates the creation myth and the emergence of gods. The episodes are set in Hyuga and focus on Shinto creation myths. Initially aired on NHK and its on-demand service, the episodes were later compiled into a festival version titled 'The Hyuga Episode of Kojiki'. This version, which includes the episodes 'The Cleansing', 'Sun Goddess Amaterasu', 'Flowering Tree', and 'Umisachi and Yamasachi', has been screened at various international festivals, including Ottawa, MONSTRA, and Animafest, and was also a part of the Jury Selection at the 17th Japan Media Arts Festival.",
