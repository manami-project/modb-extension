  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kantarou Ichinomiya has had the ability to see demons since childhood, which has led to isolation from humans but close friendships with supernatural beings instead. His life changes forever when he hears tales of a legendary demon called the ogre-eating Tengu, reputed to possess unrivaled strength. Kantarou vows to find this Tengu one day. Years later, Kantarou works as a professional folklore author and exorcist, using his spiritual gifts to banish harmful spirits. During one such case investigating a sealed shrine, he finally locates and releases the mythical ogre-eating Tengu. Kantarou names him Haruka, binding the Tengu as his servant, though Haruka seems depleted of full strength with no memories of his fabled past. Together with Kantarou's resident kitsune assistant Youko, the trio solves paranormal mysteries and assists benign spirits, while also seeking to uncover Haruka's origins. Though challenged by rent payments, their supernatural adventures reveal the bonds of trust and friendship can overcome hardship.",
