  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Harukaâ€™s master, Kantarou Ichinomiya, has always been able to see and communicate with demons, a gift that set him apart from his peers and led him to form bonds with these supernatural beings. Fascinated by tales of the ogre-eating Tengu, Kantarou embarks on a lifelong quest to find this legendary demon. As a folklore writer and demon-buster, he travels the land, finally stumbling upon the Tengu's resting place in a secluded shrine.\n\nUpon freeing the Tengu, Kantarou names him Haruka, thus binding the demon to his will. Despite his reputation as an invincible force, Haruka seems to have lost some of his power and is unable to consume oni. Together with the cunning kitsune Youko, Kantarou and Haruka form an unlikely team, tackling various supernatural incidents while uncovering the enigmatic past of the once-mighty Tengu. As they delve deeper into the world of youkai, Kantarou's unwavering determination and Haruka's hidden strength may just be the key to restoring the Tengu's former glory.",
