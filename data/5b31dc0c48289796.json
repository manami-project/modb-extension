    "text": "This anime unfolds in a mythical realm where colossal beasts, known as Kyojuu, once shaped the earth, only to have it seized by humans. Enraged, the Kyojuu retaliated by preying on humans, who then sought divine intervention to combat these monstrous creatures. In this era of swords and heroes, humans not only battled the Kyojuu but also exploited their remains for profit, leading to societal advancements.\n\nEnter Jiiro, a seasoned Kyojuu hunter who narrowly escaped death's grasp. One day, he encounters a young woman named Kuumi, who is being pursued by mysterious individuals. Compelled to save her, Jiiro embarks on a journey to unravel the world's enigmas alongside his new companion.\n\nAs whispers of clandestine experiments and human machinations begin to surface, the duo discovers that the real threat may not be the Kyojuu, but rather their fellow humans. In this action-packed narrative, Jiiro and Kuumi must navigate a world teeming with danger and deception, where the line between hero and villain blurs, and the greatest mysteries lie within humanity itself.",
