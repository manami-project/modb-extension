    "text": "Awajima Musical School Training Camp, affectionately known as the 'boarding house', is a haven for young girls from across Japan, each harboring dreams of stardom on the stage. This unique institution serves as both a sanctuary and a fierce battleground, fostering talent while also pitting aspiring students against one another. Among the attendees are Tabata Wakana, a starry-eyed girl yearning to become a musical sensation; Takehara Kinue, the housemaster who is there to fulfill her best friend's wishes; the stunning Okabe Emi, a scholarship student who constantly finds herself in the limelight; and Ibuki Katsurako, a teacher hailing from a lineage of actresses. As the girls navigate through their formative years, the story unfolds from varying perspectives, offering a profound exploration of each character's psyche. This coming-of-age series promises a rich tapestry of experiences, with a hint of a familiar face from 'Sweet Blue Flowers' making an appearance.",
