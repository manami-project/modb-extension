When her past resurfaces, Fena breaks free from her shackles and embarks on a quest to forge a new identity and find a place where she truly belongs. Driven by the enigmatic keyword 'Eden,' Fena sets sail on a grand adventure with her crew of misfits and unlikely allies. Along the way, she reunites with her childhood friend Yukimaru and encounters a group of fierce warriors known as the Samurai Seven. Together, they navigate treacherous waters, face uncanny adversaries, and unravel the mysteries surrounding Fena's father's final journey. Will Fena find the elusive Eden and uncover the truth behind her father's legacy? Join Fena and her crew in this epic anime premiering on Crunchyroll in summer 2021, with regular broadcasting in Japan starting in October 2021.",
