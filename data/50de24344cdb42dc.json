  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Inui Juzo, also known as Gun Slave Unit Device 13, finds himself in possession of a valuable data carrier belonging to Rosa McMahon, a young woman he recently rescued. The data carrier, disguised as a pendant, contains incriminating evidence against the Berühren Corporation, which is accused of causing an extender to run amok. As a result, Juzo becomes the target of various factions, including the anti-Extended terrorist group Spitzbergen, led by Wachowski, who seeks to use the data to destroy Berühren's Gun Slave Unit Device 7.\n\nMeanwhile, Juzo's partner, Mary Steinberg, narrowly escapes an ambush by Spitzbergen, while their colleague Tetsurou is captured. The trail of the attack leads to Victor, Mary's estranged brother and Juzo's first customer, known as the \"Dismantler\" for his ability to destroy extenders effortlessly. As Mary and Juzo brace for a personal confrontation with Victor, Tetsurou vows never to hesitate again after the death of their comrade, Colt.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Pepper, a determined individual, sets her sights on making Juzo her property, along with her current Gun Slave Unit, Seven. With corruption and double-crosses at every turn, Juzo must navigate the treacherous world of extenders and terrorists while protecting Rosa's data and confronting his past.",
