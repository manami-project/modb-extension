  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Taro Sakamoto was once considered the greatest assassin in the criminal underworld, feared by enemies and admired by fellow hitmen alike. However, after meeting and falling in love with a woman, Sakamoto abandoned his life of crime, got married, and became a father. He now works as a humble convenience store owner in hopes of leaving his dangerous past behind. But Sakamoto's shady history proves difficult to escape. Former rivals and partners, refusing to believe he has truly reformed, show up intent on taking him out. Though barred from killing, Sakamoto must tap into his formidable skills to creatively subdue these threats and prevent harm coming to his new family and quiet small-town life. Balancing the roles of loving father and vigilant protector presents an entertaining challenge for this legendary-turned-unlikely hero. Get ready for a new kind of action comedy centered around a deceptively ordinary neighborhood store owner harboring extraordinary secrets.",
