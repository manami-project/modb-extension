  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a world where magic has existed alongside science for over a century, a material called MISO was discovered that allowed magic to be studied and developed like a skill rather than remain a mysterious, unknowable force. The story follows Shōta Hacchōya, a high school student attending a magic academy. One morning while eating breakfast, Shōta is surprised when Artemisia, a princess from Majieeru - the birthplace of magic - suddenly breaks into his home. It appears Artemisia is on the run from a dangerous enemy and takes the shocked Shōta with her as she flees. As Shōta gets swept up with the princess of magic's homeland, he is thrust into a conflict likely involving the future of sorcery itself. This series blends fantasy and magic with contemporary settings and scenarios, juxtaposing the extraordinary with the mundane. Viewers can expect exciting adventures underpinned by a deeper exploration of the nature of magic in Shōta's world.",
