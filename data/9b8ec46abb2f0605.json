  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This claymation anime centers around the adventures of Jam, an elementary school-aged 'housnail' living in a village with his family and friends. Housnails are fictional snail-like creatures that have small houses with roofs and windows on their backs, hence the portmanteau name combining \"house\" and \"snail.\" As the focal point of the series, viewers follow Jam's daily life events and relationships within the housnail community. With its whimsical concept of house-bearing snails, imaginative storytelling, and endearing claymation visuals, this anime promises to deliver lighthearted entertainment for the whole family. Originally part of NHK's children's programming block Petit Petit Anime, this charming show invites audiences into the tiny world of Jam and his fellow housnails.",
