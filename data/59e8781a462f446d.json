    "text": "Chino Kafuu, a soft-spoken granddaughter of Rabbit House cafe's founder, finds her quiet life turned upside down when the bubbly and outgoing Kokoa Hoto moves into her family's cafe and boarding house. As the new high school student starts working as a waitress to pay for her lodging, she quickly befriends a diverse group of girls, each with their own quirks and charms.\n\nRize Tedeza, a part-timer at Rabbit House, boasts an unusual military background that lends her extraordinary strength and peculiar habits. Meanwhile, Chiya Ujimatsu, a waitress from a nearby rival cafe, possesses an unhurried and carefree demeanor. Finally, there's Sharo Kirima, a waitress from another cafe, who exudes elegance despite her humble circumstances.\n\nAs this lovable group of waitresses navigates the whimsical world of Rabbit House, they share countless heartwarming and amusing adventures. With the enigmatic talking rabbit, Tippy, often perched on Chino's head, each day at the cafe is filled with laughter, friendship, and a touch of mystery. Join Kokoa and her friends in Gochuumon wa Usagi Desu ka?, a delightful comedy that captures the essence of youth, camaraderie, and the joy of finding a place to call home.",
