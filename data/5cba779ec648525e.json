Fast forward to 2030, Akira finds himself resurrected as an advanced AI weapon, EX-ARM, inside a machine. He is introduced to this new reality by Minami Uezono, a police officer, and her android partner, Alma. Stranded on an enemy ship, the trio must rely on their wit and combat abilities to escape. Initially hesitant, Akira is spurred into action by his brother's memories, taking control of Alma's body and unleashing his martial arts skills. Upon connecting to the ship's system, Akira discovers the immense power of EX-ARM, effortlessly commandeering the vessel. Upon their return, Akira joins the EX-ARM Countermeasure Prevention Team, dedicated to combating the destructive forces seeking to harness the power of EX-ARMs. Driven by the desire to end the chaos caused by these weapons, Akira embarks on a mission to reclaim his memories and his former life.",
