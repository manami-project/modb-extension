    "text": "Second Volunteer Club: A High School student, Taro Sado, grapples with an unusual affliction - masochism. In an attempt to cure himself and win the heart of his crush, he joins the Second Volunteer Club, a group known for fulfilling students' wishes. The club, however, is far from ordinary. Led by Mio Isurugi, a self-proclaimed goddess with a peculiar fear of cats, the club members each have their own eccentricities. Among them is Arashiko Yuuno, the girl who unintentionally triggered Taro's masochistic tendencies, and Tatsukichi Hayama, Taro's cross-dressing best friend. As Taro undergoes the club's unconventional 'training' regimens, he navigates the challenges of high school life, his unique condition, and the idiosyncrasies of his new clubmates. Will Taro find a cure for his masochism, or will the trials of the Second Volunteer Club push him further into his peculiar predilection? Only time will tell in this comedic exploration of acceptance, friendship, and the strange world of high school clubs.",
