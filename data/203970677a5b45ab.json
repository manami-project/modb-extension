    "text": "These synopses introduce us to a formidable protagonist, George Kodama, also known as Jouji, who arrives in the troubled city of Sagaru, driven by the enigma of his past. With only a single clue, the name Araki Genzou, he embarks on a perilous quest to unravel a mystery that dates back more than 15 years.\n\nSagaru, once a thriving city, is now a battleground for two ruthless factions, the Tanakura and Ginzame groups, who wage a relentless war for dominance. Amidst this turmoil, Kodama, a clever and deadly combatant, finds himself entangled in the conflict, working as a bodyguard to sustain his search.\n\nAs the city's unease escalates with his arrival, Kodama becomes the unwitting centerpiece of a bloody gang fight. With bullets flying and alliances shifting, he must navigate the treacherous landscape of Sagaru. Will his intelligence and combat prowess be enough to save the city and uncover the truth he seeks? Or will the city's chaos consume him, leaving his mystery unsolved and his life forfeit?\n\nInspired by Akira Kurosawa's 1961 masterpiece, Yojimbo, this anime promises a thrilling journey of self-discovery, survival, and redemption.",
