    "text": "When the formidable Talpa is vanquished, the Ronin Warriors anticipate a well-deserved respite. Amidst Ryo's birthday festivities and Kento's lottery triumph, an unsettling news report emerges from New York, detailing a menacing, armored killer on a rampage. The armor's familiarity strikes a chord with the warriors, prompting an urgent investigation.\n\nUpon their arrival, they're confronted by the malevolent sorcerer Shikaisen, who has unveiled the armors' hidden potential and seeks to claim it. To their disbelief, Sage's armor is commandeered by the sorcerer, causing chaos in New York. The warriors embark on a mission to Los Angeles, aiming to rescue their friend and thwart Shikaisen's ambitions.\n\nSimultaneously, Sage is lured to New York by a teacher who uncovers cryptic writings related to his clan and the enigmatic Armor of Light. As Sage vanishes inexplicably, the Samurai Troopers scour New York for their comrade, stumbling upon the Armor of Light and its perilous secrets. Will they reunite with Sage unscathed and unravel the mysteries surrounding his clan and the Armor of Light?",
