    "text": "Pipi, a mermaid, and Triton, a green-haired youth, are the sole survivors of Atlantis' destruction at the hands of the malevolent Poseidon. Raised by a compassionate fisherman, Triton remains oblivious to his true lineage until his thirteenth birthday. Upon learning the truth, Triton embarks on a perilous journey to confront Poseidon and restore harmony to the oceans. Accompanied by his aquatic allies, including the white dolphin Ruka and Pipi, Triton seeks to fulfill his destiny.\n\nOriginally a re-edition of the TV series, this anime was released in two parts. The first part premiered in theaters during the Uchuu Senkan Yamato Festival, while the second part was initially unveiled decades later on home video by Nippon Columbia. Both parts were eventually combined and released on DVD in 1999 and 2002.",
