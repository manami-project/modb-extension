    "text": "Kendo swings, gunshots echo, and the once peaceful Fujimi High School is now a battleground for survival as a sudden zombie outbreak wreaks havoc on the students and faculty. High school student Takashi Komuro finds himself in the midst of this chaos, forced to kill his best friend turned undead and vowing to protect his early love, Rei Miyamoto.\n\nJoined by a diverse group of classmates and their school nurse, the survivors must navigate the treacherous halls of their high school and the crumbling society outside. Governments have fallen, and the deadly disease is spreading uncontrolled, turning humans into flesh-eating monsters.\n\nAs they search for their families and a safe haven, the group must band together and rely on each other's unique skills to conquer the undead apocalypse. Will their combined strength be enough to survive the horrors that surround them, or will they become just another meal for the ravenous hordes? The fight for survival has just begun in this new world of the living dead.",
