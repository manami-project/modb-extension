    "text": "Rin, Haruka, and Makoto, once an inseparable trio in their elementary school swimming class, are now navigating the complexities of college life and future aspirations. Haruka, attending a university in Tokyo, unexpectedly crosses paths with Asahi, a former teammate from middle school, triggering a flood of memories from their shared past. The reunion stirs up painful recollections of their disbanded swimming team, particularly involving Ikuya, who still holds a grudge against Haruka for quitting, leading to the team's dissolution.\n\nAs Haruka grapples with his strained friendship with Ikuya and the resurfaced memories, he also faces the daunting task of establishing himself in the competitive world of swimming, aiming to compete internationally. Meanwhile, Makoto is chasing his own dreams in Tokyo alongside Haruka, and Rin encounters an unexpected surprise in Sydney.\n\nAs they stand on the precipice of their new futures, the friends must confront the challenges that lie ahead. Will they be able to overcome their past and emerge stronger, or will they be pulled back into the whirlpool of old rivalries and resentments? The Iwatobi Swim Club is back, and the stage is set for a thrilling new chapter in their lives.",
