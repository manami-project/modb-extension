    "text": "After winning the regional tournament, the Kiyosumi High School mahjong team has qualified to compete at the prestigious National High School Mahjong Tournament in Tokyo. There, they will face opponents from top schools across Japan that could exceed their skills. The National Tournament provides an opportunity for the Kiyosumi team to reunite with friends and rivals from other schools that they met at the training camp prior to the tournament. However, they have little time for reminiscing once the tournament begins, as they quickly realize their opponents should not be underestimated. Among the Kiyosumi team, Saki Miyanaga aims to advance far enough in the tournament bracket to have a long-awaited rematch against her estranged sister Teru, a top player from another school. Though the road ahead will be challenging, Saki refuses to back down from achieving her goal. With the whole Kiyosumi squad determined to succeed on the national stage, they enter the tournament ready to put their intensive training and passion for mahjong to the test against the nation's best high school players.",
