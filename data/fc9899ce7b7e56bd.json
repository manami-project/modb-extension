    "text": "Akari, Chinatsu, Kyouko, and Yui are four middle school friends and members of their school's Amusement Club. As they approach the 10th anniversary of the manga that brought them together, the girls want to organize a celebration to commemorate the occasion. Their initial ideas involve wild imaginings of the club in prehistoric times. But with the helpful input of classmates Ayano and Chitose, they decide on a more down-to-earth party in their club room. As they bake treats and plan surprises for one of their own, their quirky personalities and close bonds shine through. Though the road to the party takes some silly detours, the enthusiasm of Akari, Chinatsu, Kyouko, Yui and friends wins out in the end. Their camaraderie and humor is sure to make for an enjoyable commemoration and continued adventures.",
