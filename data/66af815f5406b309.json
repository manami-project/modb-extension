    "text": "Nemuru Kushinada, the aloof class president, issues a cryptic warning to the newly arrived Hiroshi Kuzumi: stay away from the old part of town. The year is 1983, and Hiroshi, a 16-year-old student, has just moved to the remote mountain village of Jogamachi with his family. Despite its serene appearance, the village is steeped in ancient customs and divided by a river that separates the old from the new. As Hiroshi settles into his new life and befriends his classmates, he finds himself entangled in a web of interconnected mysteries and eerie traditions that lurk in the shadows of this seemingly idyllic village. When people begin to vanish without a trace, Hiroshi must confront the sinister secrets that lie hidden in the old part of town, where the line between gods and wolves becomes increasingly blurred. In this enigmatic world, can Hiroshi uncover the truth behind the mysterious disappearances and unravel the ancient riddles that bind the village together?",
