  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rumour whispers of an eccentric artist named Toriyama Sekiei, residing in a quaint Japanese town during the historic Edo period. This reclusive genius rarely ventures outside, but when he does, it's for a peculiar purpose. Toriyama Sekiei is no ordinary artist; he draws supernatural creatures, but not from the depths of his imagination. Instead, he sketches these demons from memory, following real-life encounters with them. His brush serves a dual purpose: a tool for art and a weapon against the supernatural. As word spreads of his unique talent and knowledge, desperate townsfolk seek his aid, leading to thrilling battles that precede his artistic creations.",
