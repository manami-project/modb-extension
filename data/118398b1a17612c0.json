  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This thought-provoking anime offers a unique perspective on the fragile nature of life and death. Through a series of vignettes, we witness an unfolding operation through the eyes of the surgical team. Tension builds as they work urgently to save the patient. However, the outcome remains unclear even as the final scene fades out. Created as a 1st year project in 2015 for the Tokyo University of the Arts, this animation prompts us to reflect on mortality while celebrating the dedication of medical professionals. The visuals, music, and sound design all complement each other to create a meditative viewing experience. While the fate of the patient is left open to interpretation, the anime underscores how lives hang in the balance during complex surgical procedures.",
