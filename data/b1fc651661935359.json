  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On a quest to find the enigmatic Book of Vanitas, Noé, a young vampire, embarks on a journey to the bustling city of Paris during the 19th century. This fabled tome, rumored to possess the power to curse vampires, is said to be the creation of a vengeful vampire named Vanitas, who was shunned by his own kind for being born under a blue moon. Noé's search takes an unexpected turn when he encounters a peculiar human who claims to be a vampire doctor and carries the very book Noé seeks.\n\nAs Noé and the eccentric Vanitas cross paths, they find themselves entangled in a series of incidents involving a bloodthirsty vampire serial killer and the mysterious Charlatan's Parade. With the doctor's unique ability to restore sanity to vampires by uncovering their true names, Noé must decide whether to trust the human and join his quest to \"cure\" the entire vampire race. As they navigate the tension between humans and vampires, Noé and Vanitas forge an unlikely alliance, setting the stage for a thrilling tale of curses, salvation, and the search for the truth behind the legendary Book of Vanitas.",
