    "text": "In 13th century Nottingham County, England, the greedy Baron Alwine and Bishop Herfort tyrannize the people through threats and unjust laws. When Alwine orders the destruction of the Huntingtons' castle, young Robert Huntington flees to Sherwood Forest with his cousins Will, Winifred, and Barbara. There, under the guidance of the wise Friar Tuck, they learn to survive in the wilderness. They soon encounter Little John's band of young outlaws, also hiding from Alwine's cruelty. After an initial conflict, Robin and Little John realize they share a common foe. Together with the fair Marian Lancaster, who faces a forced adoption by the scheming Bishop, they unite to oppose Alwine's injustice. Led by the bold and skillful archer Robin, whose magical bow makes him a living legend, the band of friends fights to protect the poor and innocent people of Nottingham. Through unthinkable dangers and thrilling adventures, their bravery and sacrifice light a beacon of hope against the shadow of tyranny.",
