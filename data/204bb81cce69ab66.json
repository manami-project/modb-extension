  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Norse, Greek, and Hindu deities convene in a divine assembly every millennium to determine the fate of mankind. Disgusted by humanity's selfishness and destruction, the gods unanimously decide to extinguish them. However, Brunhilde, the eldest of the 13 Valkyrie sisters, intervenes and proposes a final contest to give humans a fighting chance. She suggests Ragnarok, a series of 13 one-on-one battles between the most formidable gods and the strongest human champions from history. The gods initially scoff at the idea but eventually agree to the challenge out of pride and anger. Brunhilde and her sisters embark on a mission to select humanity's most exceptional warriors to compete in these decisive duels. The first side to win seven battles will dictate whether humanity will continue to exist or meet its ultimate end. Will humans rise to the occasion and surpass the gods, or will they succumb to their seemingly invincible foes? The epic battle between heaven and earth commences, with the fate of human civilization hanging in the balance.",
