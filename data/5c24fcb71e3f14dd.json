  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Note: The anime follows the cheerful and lovable ox, Ollie, who manages the whimsical Funny Farm. Joined by an eclectic mix of friends, including a jolly mole, a nautical octopus, a loyal turtle, and a ravenous crocodile, Ollie is always at the heart of an amusing escapade. From constructing a new well to relishing the first snowfall, evading the crocodile's snapping jaws, or working out to gain strength, there's never a dull moment on the Funny Farm. The farm is also home to other unique characters like a turtle with a TV under his shell, a bald lion, and an elephant with a versatile trunk that serves as a garden hose. Originally aired in 104 episodes of 12 minutes each, the show often presented two episodes in a single 24-minute slot.",
