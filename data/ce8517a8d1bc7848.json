  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kitaoka Yume's unexpected collision with the 13-year-old Nakamachi Kana sparks a life-altering chain of events for the young orphan. After losing her beloved grandmother, Kana finds herself alone and desperate for a place to call home. With no one willing to hire a minor without parental consent, her prospects seem bleak. However, Yume's timely introduction to her workplace, the Fuhshin Gazette, offers Kana a glimmer of hope.\n\nThe Fuhshin Gazette, a local newspaper delivery business, offers Kana not just a job, but a place to stay as well. In exchange for her hard work, she'll have a roof over her head and a quirky, all-female team to share her days with. From the ever-energetic Yume and her sweet-toothed partner Yuuki Minami, to the thrifty Hinata Azuma, the tipsy Haruka Nishida, and the wise-beyond-her-years Saki Amano, each co-worker brings their unique flavor to Kana's new life.\n\nBut life at the Fuhshin Gazette isn't all fun and games. Kana must navigate challenging delivery routes, pacify territorial guard dogs, and face off against Mika Kujiin, a rival from a competing store. As she learns the ropes of her new job and adapts to her eccentric colleagues, Kana embarks on a journey filled with laughter, tears, and the unforgettable memories of her newfound family.",
