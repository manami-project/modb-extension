  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yin Yang fortune-teller Arimasa Tsuchimikado, half-human and half-fox, finds himself ostracized by his village despite being their only defense against supernatural threats. As a child, he rescued and befriended Kagetsu, a shape-shifting feline tribe member capable of choosing its gender based on its mate. Kagetsu, who currently identifies as male, seeks Arimasa years later with an unusual request: to bear his child.\n\nSet in the Kamakura period of Japan, their peaceful existence is disrupted when Arimasa is accused of plotting to assassinate the shogun. Forced to flee, the pair escape into the mountains, where Kagetsu's tribe resides. Amidst the turmoil, Kagetsu struggles with the decision of choosing a permanent gender, a choice complicated by his affection for Arimasa.\n\nAs the supernatural attacks on the village escalate, Arimasa must make difficult choices to protect both Kagetsu and the villagers who once scorned him. Their journey explores the depths of their bond, the challenges of societal prejudice, and the intricate complexities of Kagetsu's tribe, all while evading the looming threat of the shadowy assassin.",
