    "text": "The lively music video brings to life the cheerful song \"Oka Shika Chika Ika Saka\" performed by the Japanese band SAKANAMON. Animated by Manabu Himeda, this catchy tune was showcased on NHK's beloved Minna no Uta program, which highlights original songs paired with imaginative videos. SAKANAMON's rhythmic vocals and upbeat melodies are complemented by Himeda's vibrant and kinetic visuals. As the band members skip and dance across the screen, vibrant shapes and colors swirl around them. The high energy of both song and animation captures a playful, carefree spirit. Whether you're already a SAKANAMON fan or new to their music, this delightfully weird and wonderful video is sure to make you want to get up and dance along. It offers a glimpse into the creative spirit behind NHK's Minna no Uta series.",
