  "synopsis": {
    "text": "High school student Hiyori Hayama harbors dreams of becoming a successful singer, but her journey in the entertainment industry is fraught with failed auditions and unsold songs. In the near future, a new craze has swept both children and adults alike: Hyper Sports, an extreme form of athletics that utilizes special gear and power-ups. Hiyori, initially uninvolved with Hyper Sports, finds herself drawn into this world after a chance encounter. To further her career, she joins the Extreme Hearts tournament, a popular Hyper Sports event that offers participants the opportunity to make their big break. Despite her athleticism, Hiyori's unfamiliarity with Hyper Sports proves challenging. However, she finds support in new friends who are experienced in various sports, and together they form Team RISE. As they compete in the tournament, Hiyori and her teammates learn about the unspoken rule of Extreme Hearts: all competitors must be entertainers or aspire to be one. Through their shared experiences, the members of Team RISE forge lasting friendships and discover new passions, all while striving to help Hiyori reach the top.",
