  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2020 in Japan, Shin Hazama's ordinary life is upended when he encounters another version of himself from an alternate reality. This alternate Shin has led a starkly different life, indicating the existence of parallel worlds. As the two Shins grapple with this revelation, cracks form in the fabric of their realities. The lives they had taken for granted now seem fragile and subject to dramatic change. Shin and his friends are faced with a choice: retreat into the familiar to preserve their conception of \"normalcy,\" or step through the cracks into exhilarating new possibilities. Their decision will determine not only their own fates, but the interrelation between worlds. Boys and girls alike find themselves questioning everything in this coming-of-age story. As the borders between realities blur, each must look within and decide what to think and choose when the world itself transforms.",
