  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2030, a viral pandemic named \"Gibia\" has ravaged Japan, transforming infected humans into monsters based on their age, gender and ethnicity. From the past, a seasoned samurai and a young ninja arrive to find Japan a wasteland haunted by the Gibia-turned monsters and desperate outlaws. Joining forces with a doctor searching for a cure, the time-displaced warriors venture across this nightmarish landscape rife with ravenous creatures and cutthroat gangs. Bonding through battle, the unlikely trio begin a dangerous quest to end the Gibia plague, braving bloodthirsty beasts, hostile survivors and exposing themselves to the ever-present contagion. Through resourcefulness and steel, the samurai, ninja and doctor inch towards a cure while struggling to retain their humanity. Their epidemic odyssey will push them to their physical and moral limits as they confront the human toll of Gibia in a Japan twisted into a monster-ruled dystopia.",
