    "text": "Can you imagine being late for school and suddenly finding yourself in a world where you're the center of attention? Meet Miyuki, a typical Japanese schoolgirl who stumbles upon an extraordinary adventure when she's transported to a fantastical realm filled with eccentric female inhabitants, all vying for her affection.\n\nIn this whimsical world, Miyuki encounters a mischievous Cheshire Cat with a sinful streak, an Eastern twist on the classic duo Tweedle-dee and Tweedle-dum, and a Queen of Hearts who will give you the chills. As she delves deeper into this rabbit hole in the middle of the sidewalk, she's met with a series of peculiar escapades and a bevy of beautiful women, each with their eyes set on her.\n\nAll Miyuki wanted was to maintain her perfect attendance record, but now she's caught in a strange and creepy world. Will she be able to escape this bewildering place and return to her mundane life, or will she forever be entangled in this web of desire and intrigue? Join Miyuki on her bizarre journey and discover the secrets that lie within this enigmatic wonderland.",
