  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kuriyama Aiko, a clumsy yet endearing school nurse, and Satoshi Yabe, a newly graduated teacher, find themselves entangled in the whirlwind of chaos brought on by the Marui triplets in class 6-3 at Kamohashi Elementary School. The 11-year-old sisters, each with their own distinct personalities, share a common goal: to unite Yabe and Aiko through unconventional means.\n\nMitsuba, the eldest and most mature of the trio, exhibits sadistic tendencies, while Futaba, the athletic middle child, possesses the strength of a grown man and a lecherous streak. The youngest, Hitoha, appears quiet and gentle but hides a cunning and perverted nature. Together, they rule their classroom and relentlessly push their teacher, Yabe, into awkward situations.\n\nDespite his initial dreams of a peaceful teaching career, Yabe must navigate the unpredictable antics of the Marui sisters as they persistently meddle in his life. Will he be able to maintain his sanity amidst the chaos, or will the mischievous triplets ultimately succeed in their matchmaking schemes? Only time will tell in this wild, comedic adventure.",
