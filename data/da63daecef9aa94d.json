  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fujiwara Naeka is a 17-year-old high school student who, along with her brother Kousuke, stands to inherit a vast fortune from their late tycoon grandfather in just half a year when Naeka turns 18. However, there are others who seek to steal their inheritance, putting their lives at risk. To protect the siblings, their grandfather's estate dispatches two skilled servants - Fubuki, a graceful and beautiful young maid, and Kogarashi, a powerfully-built man who wears a mask and serves as a male maid. Though initially put off by Kogarashi's eccentric and overbearing service, Naeka soon grows used to having the hulking yet devoted Kogarashi and the gentle Fubuki around. With only six months until she comes of age, Naeka tries to balance her everyday high school life with the mounting danger posed by those attempting to take the fortune she is destined to inherit. Yet, with her stalwart protectors supporting her, Naeka gains confidence to face whatever threats emerge.",
