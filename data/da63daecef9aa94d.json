  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Naeka Fujiwara appears to be an ordinary 17-year-old high school student, but she harbors a secret: she is one of the last remaining heirs to her grandfather's colossal fortune, which she will inherit upon turning 18. To safeguard her and her brother Kousuke from those who seek to seize their inheritance, two unconventional maids are assigned to their service. Fubuki, a stunningly beautiful maid, captures Kousuke's attention, while Kogarashi, a towering and muscular masked maid with a shark-like grin, dedicates himself to protecting Naeka. Kogarashi's boisterous and intrusive attempts to serve Naeka bring unexpected excitement to her daily life, while her considerable and seemingly gravity-defying bosom becomes a constant target for Kogarashi and other males. For Kousuke, this new life filled with beautiful maids is a dream come true, but for Naeka, it's a chaotic whirlwind of protection and unwanted attention.",
