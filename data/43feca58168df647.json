    "text": "Yume de Aetara tells the story of Fuguno Masuo, an unlucky-in-love guy who has reached adulthood without ever having a girlfriend. When Masuo meets the beautiful Shiozaki Nagisa, he falls for her at first sight. For the first time, Masuo's heart awakens to the possibility of romance. However, winning Nagisa's affection will be an uphill battle for Masuo. He faces competition from two rivals - the charming and handsome Kaizuka, and the uncouth but wealthy Kujira. As if his rivals weren't obstacle enough, Masuo has a comical tendency to end up in compromising misunderstandings with other women, always at the worst possible moments. Still, Masuo is determined to overcome his misfortunes and try his best to win over Nagisa. This lighthearted romantic comedy follows Masuo's humorous misadventures in love against the odds. With persistence and maybe a little luck, can an eternal bachelor finally find a girlfriend?",
