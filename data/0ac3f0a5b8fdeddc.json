    "text": "Though primitive in CG rendering, the 20-minute movie, Biohazard 4D Executor, unfolds a gripping tale of an elite UBCS squad on a mission to locate Dr. Cameron, a scientist working for Umbrella Corporation who has gone missing in the chaos-ridden Raccoon City. The team, comprising Rodrigo, Roger, Klaus, Ed, and Norman, is equipped with a GPS device to trace Dr. Cameron's last known whereabouts, leading them to a massive food factory. As they venture into the factory, the squad encounters a monstrous creature, a terrifying blend of a Tyrant and the advanced forms of Nemesis, setting the stage for a thrilling survival ordeal.",
