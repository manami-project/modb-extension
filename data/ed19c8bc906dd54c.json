  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This abstract anime from Rina Okada's graduate work at Tokyo University of the Arts focuses on the interplay of light and shadows. It involves holding up minerals and stones to the sunlight and observing the shapes created as light radiates through the translucent stones. As sunlight pierces the stones, shadows take form, gradually transforming into discernible silhouettes. The anime captures the meditative process of light and darkness mingling to give definition to once amorphous spots. Though the narrative seems to lack concrete characters or plot, the visuals likely showcase creative cinematography. Centered on patient observation rather than events, this anime may appeal to viewers seeking a thoughtful, minimalist aesthetic.",
