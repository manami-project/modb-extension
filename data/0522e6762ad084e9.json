  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokio Abiko transfers to a school in Tokyo from his hometown in Yamagata Prefecture, eager to prove himself and earn respect. On his first day, Tokio crosses paths with an eccentric red-haired boy named Japan Hinomoto, who pesters Tokio about his home prefecture. Tokio soon discovers Japan's obsession with Japanese geography extends far beyond small talk - he has developed \"Todofu-ken,\" a unique martial art with 47 distinct styles representing each of Japan's prefectures. Though initially dismissive, Tokio becomes drawn into Japan's zany world as they bond over their shared roots in the countryside. With Japan as his guide on an absurd tour of the nation, the tough and scrappy Tokio finds himself opening up to new friendships and perspectives. Through clashes and shenanigans with Japan's diverse martial art styles, Tokio gains insight into the richness of Japan's regional cultures - and a newfound appreciation for his own home prefecture.",
