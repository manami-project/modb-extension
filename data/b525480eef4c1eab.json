    "text": "Now adays, reality TV dominates the airwaves, and in this world, a groundbreaking social experiment unfolds. Six ordinary individuals, each from varying walks of life, are selected and subjected to brainwashing to make them believe they are one big, happy family. As the \"Eternal Family,\" they are placed in a confined space, and their every interaction is scrutinized to observe how they function as a unit.\n\nHowever, when a recording of their lives is leaked and gains massive popularity, the family unwittingly becomes the stars of a hit reality show. The world watches their every move, unbeknownst to the family themselves. But when a mundane plumbing issue triggers a series of unforeseen events, the family manages to break free from their controlled environment.\n\nNot willing to lose their golden goose, the show's producers embark on a relentless pursuit to recapture every member of the Eternal Family. Originally aired as a series of 53 bite-sized commercials, each about half a minute long, this unique anime explores the lengths people will go to for entertainment and the resilience of the human spirit.",
