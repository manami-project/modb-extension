  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Panty and Stocking are two foul-mouthed angel sisters who were kicked out of Heaven for their crude behavior. They are sent to Daten City, a place on the border between Heaven and Hell filled with ghosts - spirits of humans who met horrible deaths. The sisters now have to battle these ghosts in order to collect Heaven Coins and earn their way back into Heaven. Panty is a blonde, hypersexual girl who spends most of her time sleeping around or eating candy, while Stocking is a gothic lolita who loves stuffing her face with sweets. Their boss, a priest named Garterbelt, tries to keep them focused on fighting ghosts, but the sisters are easily distracted by their vices. They transform their lingerie into powerful weapons to fight the ghosts, but often cause lots of lewd collateral damage to the city in the process. Follow Panty, Stocking and Garterbelt as they fend off ghosts and fight their own bad habits in this raunchy supernatural comedy about sex, sugar and redemption against the odds. Their chances of getting back to Heaven are slim, but with these unorthodox angels, anything can happen.",
