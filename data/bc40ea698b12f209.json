  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fortress of Iron and a Battle of Unato: Half a year has elapsed since the events of the first season, and Ikoma, Mumei, and their companions find themselves in the war-torn city of Unato, where an alliance of resistance fighters is locked in a desperate struggle against a horde of ravenous kabane. As the crew of the armored train Koutetsujou joins the battle, Ikoma becomes increasingly suspicious of the kabane's unusually coordinated attack patterns and seeks to investigate a secret tunnel leading to the kabane nestâ€”the Unato Fortress. However, his kabaneri instincts raise concerns among the local commanders, leading to his temporary detention. Meanwhile, Mumei and a small group of allies take matters into their own hands, daringly venturing into the dangerous tunnel to uncover the mysterious source of power within the castle. As they delve deeper into the kabane's lair, the group uncovers horrifying truths that force them to confront the grim reality behind the kabane and the despair hidden within Unato. This thrilling sequel, split into three episodes on Netflix, follows the ongoing battle between humans and kabane, taking place at Haikou Station on the coast of the Sea of Japan.",
