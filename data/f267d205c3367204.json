  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two years after Bem, Bela, and Belo mysteriously disappeared, Sonia continues her search to find the \"humanoid monsters.\" Her investigation leads her to a pharmaceutical company, where she encounters a man named Belm who bears an uncanny resemblance to Bem. Unbeknownst to Sonia, Belm lives a quiet life with a wife and family, with no memories of his past. Meanwhile, Belo fights alone against dark forces, hoping to allow Bela to live freely as an ordinary girl. When Sonia meets Belm, he begins having nightmares that make him question his identity. As Belm's peaceful domestic life unravels, Sonia and Belo seek answers about what happened to Bem, Bela, and Belo those two years ago - and why Belm resembles Bem so closely. The three find themselves pulled into a shadowy plot more sinister than they could have imagined.",
