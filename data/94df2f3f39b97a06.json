  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shirou Emiya is a high school student who has trained in magecraft under a mysterious sorcerer for the past decade. Unbeknownst to Shirou, his hometown of Fuyuki City hosts a secret magical battle every few decades called the Holy Grail War, in which seven mages, known as Masters, summon legendary warriors called Servants to fight on their behalf. When Lancer, one of the battling Servants, grievously injures Shirou, popular classmate Rin Tohsaka saves his life at the cost of revealing her own identity as a Master. Desperate to survive, Shirou accidentally summons Saber, a powerful swordswoman Servant, to protect him. Though inexperienced, Shirou agrees to an alliance with Rin and her sarcastic Servant Archer in order to have a chance at victory. Now plunged into the Fifth Holy Grail War, Shirou must overcome his lack of training and unravel the mystery behind Archer's contempt if their makeshift team is to prevail against the other Masters. Winning would grant Shirou and his allies the omnipotent wish-granting Holy Grail - but surviving until the end will require more strength and sacrifice than Shirou could have ever imagined.",
