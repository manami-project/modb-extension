  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tylor, a 20-year-old with a penchant for laziness, greed, and women, stumbles into a life-altering hostage situation while pursuing an easy job with the United Planets Space Force. After a series of unlikely events, he emerges as the hero and is rewarded with the captaincy of the dilapidated space cruiser, Soyokaze.\n\nThe Soyokaze, a far cry from the impressive space vessels of the UPSF, is a dumping ground for the universe's misfits, including a fastidious commander, an alcoholic doctor, a stunning nurse, and a group of dim-witted marines. Tylor, who seems to be a total idiot or possibly a misunderstood genius, now leads this motley crew in the face of an impending intergalactic war with the formidable Raalgon Empire.\n\nDespite his lackadaisical attitude, Tylor must navigate the infinite expanse of the universe, steer clear of the looming Raalgon threat, and somehow convince his skeptical crew to work together. Will Tylor's seemingly infinite luck and questionable leadership skills be enough to save humanity from the brink of destruction, or will his misadventures lead them all into chaos? Join Captain Tylor and his ragtag team as they embark on a journey filled with unpredictable twists and turns.",
