  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This Japanese anime film brings to life the legend of Hagoromo, which takes place on the shores of Miho Beach. The story follows an angel who descends from heaven to bathe in the sea. While she is bathing, a curious fisherman spies the angel and secretly takes her magical feather robe, which allows her to fly. Overcome by guilt, the fisherman later returns the robe. The angel rejoices and dances joyfully up into the sky. Created as a puppet animation by first-year graduate students at Tokyo University of the Arts' Department of Animation, this ethereal film visually captures a beloved local myth passed down along Japan's Miho Beach. Blending fantasy and folklore, it promises to transport viewers into a mystical world where angels grace the shores and miracles can occur when integrity prevails.",
