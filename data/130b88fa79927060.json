  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This surreal animated film follows a young girl on both a physical and inner journey as she travels to a mysterious Western city. Upon arriving, she finds herself in a dreamlike landscape filled with gravity-defying architecture and artistic references to the works of Salvador Dali, Rene Magritte, Giorgio de Chirico and M.C. Escher. As the girl explores this fantastical world, she undergoes a transformative personal voyage where she experiences the full spectrum of life's joy and pain. By the end, she is completely changed by what she has witnessed and learned. However, when she returns from her travels, she alone knows the way in which she has grown. The film features a poem by famed Chinese poet Su Tong-Po, further emphasizing the theme of an imaginative inner journey leading to self-discovery. Through its surreal scenery and thoughtful narrative, the anime promises to take audiences on a unique exploration of personal awakening and the shaping of one's identity.",
