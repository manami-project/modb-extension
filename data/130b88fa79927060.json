Upon arriving in a city filled with surreal artwork reminiscent of Dali, Magritte, de Chirico, and Escher, she meets an old blind man who guides her through a maze of impossible staircases to the summit of a tower. However, the beauty of this strange world masks a darker reality that challenges the girl's perceptions.\n\nThrough this physical and emotional journey, the girl experiences the highs and lows of life, ultimately returning home transformed. Despite the profound change within her, she alone will comprehend the true extent of her growth.
