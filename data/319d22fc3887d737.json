    "text": "Touya, a high school student with a humble background, accidentally awakens a mystical hot spring spirit named Hakone-chan while making a wish for personal happiness. After a long period of dormancy, Hakone-chan emerges in modern-day Japan, but her prolonged slumber has transformed her into the form of a young girl. Despite initial skepticism, Touya and his friends become convinced of Hakone-chan's supernatural origins when they witness her magical abilities, such as her wooden cube's power to stir romantic feelings in Touya's crush, Haruna.\n\nIn an effort to help Hakone-chan regain her lost powers and adapt to the contemporary world, Touya forms an alliance with the spirit. Along the way, they encounter various challenges as Hakone-chan struggles to understand the complexities of modern life. As Touya and Hakone-chan work together, they forge a unique bond that blends the mystical and the mundane, creating an engaging tale of friendship, growth, and self-discovery.",
