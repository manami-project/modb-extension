    "text": "Dragon King, the pinnacle of shogi achievement, has been claimed by 16-year-old Kuzuryuu Yaichi, making him the youngest champion in history. Despite his impressive title, Yaichi finds himself in a slump, losing his passion for the game. That is, until an unexpected visitor arrives at his doorstep: Hinatsuru Ai, a nine-year-old elementary schooler with an extraordinary talent for shogi. Ai claims that Yaichi promised to be her master, a promise he can't seem to remember. However, after witnessing her skill and enthusiasm for the game, Yaichi agrees to take her on as his disciple, reigniting his own passion for shogi in the process. Together, they embark on a journey to improve their skills and prove to the world that age is just a number when it comes to mastering the game of shogi.",
