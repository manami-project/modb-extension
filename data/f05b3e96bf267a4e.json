  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Alphonso Academy, a prestigious all-boys boarding school located on a secluded island in the Atlantic Ocean, welcomes its newest student, Yuuta. The school, home to the children of the rich, famous, and aristocratic, specializes in unique subjects like empire studies and alchemy. The students here are affectionately referred to as 'Marginal Princes,' as they are destined to become kings in their respective fields.\n\nYuuta's arrival marks the beginning of a journey filled with trials and fate, as he navigates through the lives of his fellow Marginal Princes. From the charismatic student representative, Joshua Grant, to the enigmatic movie star, Alfred 'Red' Visconti, and the charming otaku, Sylvain Clark, each prince has a story to tell.\n\nDespite the idyllic setting, life at Alphonso Academy is far from perfect. Behind the veil of royalty, the Marginal Princes face their own set of challenges. As Yuuta immerses himself in his new life, he finds himself entangled in dramatic incidents, investigations, and musical numbers, all while studying to become a king. Will Yuuta be able to rise to the occasion and become a Marginal Prince himself? Only time will tell.",
