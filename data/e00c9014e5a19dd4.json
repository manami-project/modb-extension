  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As a high school student, Seiya Kanie's narcissistic personality and superior intellect lead him to believe he's the best thing since sliced bread. When the enigmatic and beautiful transfer student, Isuzu Sento, coerces him into a date at Amagi Brilliant Park, an amusement park that has seen better days, Seiya finds himself in a world of magic and wonder hidden beneath the park's dilapidated exterior.\n\nInstead of the romantic rendezvous he envisioned, Seiya is introduced to Princess Latifa Fleuranza, the park's owner, who makes an unusual request: she wants Seiya to become the park's new manager. The catch? Amagi Brilliant Park, populated by magical beings known as Maple Landers who thrive on the energy created by people having fun, is on the brink of closure. With less than three months to attract 500,000 guests and save the park from being redeveloped by a greedy real estate company, Seiya must use his wit and charm to turn the worst amusement park in Japan into a thriving magical kingdom.\n\nArmed with the knowledge that the park's employees are not just dressed in costumes, but are actual magical beings, and that the park's very existence is at stake, Seiya embarks on a wild and hilarious journey to save Amagi Brilliant Park. With an eccentric cast of characters, including scantily clad fairies, giant mice, and sniper-trained sheep, Seiya must navigate the challenges of managing a failing amusement park and discover the true meaning of friendship, teamwork, and love. Will he succeed in bringing the magic back to Amagi Brilliant Park, or will it fade into obscurity forever? Join Seiya",
