    "text": "Development of superhumans, mundane office tasks, and a secret organization with a nefarious agenda - this is the world of Touka Kuroitsu, an assistant researcher for Agastya. Agastya, disguised as an entertainment company, is secretly one of the leading organizations vying for world domination. Kuroitsu's role in the superhuman research and development department is far from glamorous. Instead, she finds herself juggling unreasonable demands from her superiors, creating presentations, implementing new superhuman features, and meeting strict deadlines and budgets. Despite the absurdity of her job, Kuroitsu remains determined to climb the corporate ladder and secure the promotion she desires. Amidst the chaos of her work life, Kuroitsu must navigate the challenges of working for an evil organization while striving to make her mark in the world of superhuman development. Will she succeed in her quest for career advancement, or will the absurdities of her job prove to be too much to handle? Only time will tell.",
