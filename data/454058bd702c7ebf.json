They arrive at Victor City, a beacon of civilization amidst the desolation, only to find it under siege by a technologically advanced group of fanatics. Daigo and his robotic pet are quickly enlisted into the defense force, but the battle seems all but lost against the relentless invaders. Just as hope fades, a colossal robot, Gordian, emerges from the shadows to repel the attackers.\n\nUnbeknownst to Daigo, his late father, a brilliant scientist, had designed Victor City and left him an extraordinary inheritance - the very same robot system that saved the city, Gordian.
