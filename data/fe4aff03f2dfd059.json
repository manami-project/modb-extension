  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story is set in the Kansei era of Japan's Edo period (1789-1800), a time when entertainment was strictly restricted under the \"Kansei Reforms\". In this setting, a man from modern-day Japan travels back in time and decides to produce a group of six Edo-period girls as idols using his knowledge of modern idol culture. The girls come from different walks of life - there is a teahouse girl, a samurai girl, a girl from a Dutch trading house, a merchant's daughter, an oiran (high-ranking courtesan), and a female ninja (kunoichi). Though they live very different lives, they share a feeling of being restricted and wanting more from life, like \"a bird trapped in a basket\". When the time traveler introduces them to the idea of being idols, it explodes their way of thinking and opens up new possibilities for them. He produces them into a group and they perform songs and dances like modern Japanese idols, despite the strict controls on entertainment in their era. Through becoming idols, the six girls find self-expression and liberation from the societal restrictions of the Kansei period.",
