    "text": "Toei Animation and Sotsu's young producers have joined forces to create SHAREDOL, an innovative fusion of two captivating concepts. Set in the Edo period's Kansei era (1789-1800), a time when entertainment was harshly suppressed under Roujuu Matsudaira Sadanobu's 'Kansei Reforms,' this anime explores the lives of six unique girls with their own set of worries.\n\nWhen a modern-day man finds himself transported back to this time, he introduces the concept of 'idols' to these young women, sparking a revolution in their otherwise mundane lives. As they embrace this new form of entertainment, the girls, each with distinct backgrounds—a teahouse girl, a samurai girl, a Dutch trading house girl, a merchant girl, an oiran, and a kunoichi—embark on a journey filled with captivating performances and personal growth.\n\nThe blend of Edo-period aesthetics and contemporary idol culture results in a visually stunning and emotionally engaging experience. With the girls' lives forever changed, they must navigate the challenges of their newfound fame while staying true to their roots. Get ready to be transported to a world where history and modernity collide in SHAREDOL, a thrilling tale of music, friendship, and self-discovery.",
