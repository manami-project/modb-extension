  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lydian Music Academy is home to some of Japan's most talented young musicians, including celebrity songstress Tsubasa Kazanari. However, unbeknownst to most, Tsubasa and her late partner Kanade Amou secretly wield ancient weapons called Symphogears to battle deadly aliens called Noise. When ordinary high school girls Hibiki Tachibana and Miku Kohinata enroll at Lydian, their lives quickly become extraordinary. Attacked by the Noise at a Tsubasa concert, Hibiki is severely wounded yet miraculously survives due to a fragment of Kanade's Symphogear embedded within her. Two years later, the Noise resurface and Hibiki discovers she now wields Kanade's Symphogear power. Despite lingering grief over Kanadeâ€™s sacrifice, Tsubasa must mentor Hibiki in mastering her newfound abilities. Together, the girls struggle to balance school life with their covert mission to harness the Symphogears' magical armor in order to defend humanity. Along the way, they learn painful lessons about loss while discovering their own courage and hope.",
