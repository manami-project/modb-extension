    "text": "Aida Mana, a compassionate and lively middle school student, finds her peaceful world disrupted when malevolent entities from the Trump Kingdom invade, unleashing monsters born from people's negative emotions. During a school visit to Clover Tower, Mana encounters one of these creatures, only to be saved by a magical fairy named Sharuru, who grants her the power to transform into Cure Heart, a legendary warrior of love.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trump Kingdom, once a haven of happiness under Princess Marie Ange's rule, has been overrun by evil forces known as the Jikochuu or Selfish. In a desperate bid to save her kingdom, Princess Marie Ange sends her loyal warrior, Cure Sword, and three fairies to the human world to find the chosen ones who can become the legendary PreCure warriors.\n\nJoining forces with Cure Sword, Cure Diamond, and Cure Rosetta, Mana, now Cure Heart, embarks on a mission to protect everyone's hearts from the corrupting influence of the Jikochuu. As they navigate through daily life and extraordinary battles, the Dokidoki PreCure team must unite to preserve love in the world and restore peace to the Trump Kingdom.",
