    "text": "Even though the magical cherry blossom trees of Hatsune-Jima have lost their enchantment and now only bloom in spring, life goes on for Jun'ichi Asakura, a soon-to-be graduate of Kazami Academy. Two years after the first season, the island's magic has faded, leaving its inhabitants to live ordinary lives. However, when a mysterious girl named Aisia arrives at Jun'ichi's doorstep in search of his late grandmother to learn magic, the quiet life he once knew is disrupted. Despite the misunderstanding that Jun'ichi possesses magical abilities, Aisia remains determined to uncover the island's hidden enchantment. As Jun'ichi's non-blood-related sister, Nemu, returns from nursing college to work at the academy's infirmary, she finds her brother living with this new girl. Meanwhile, Yoshino Sakura, who has also been gone for two years, reappears. As Aisia delves deeper into the island's past and her connection to the ever-blooming sakura, will history repeat itself, or will she bring happiness back to Hatsune-Jima?",
