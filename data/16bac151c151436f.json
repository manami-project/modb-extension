    "text": "Ryokan Hinata, a once bustling hotel now turned all-girls dormitory, becomes the unexpected home for Keitaro Urashima, a young man with a lifelong dream to attend Tokyo University. A childhood promise to a mysterious girl drives him to relentlessly pursue his dream, despite his less-than-stellar academic performance. As the new manager of the dorm, Keitaro finds himself surrounded by a diverse group of young women, each with their own eccentricities and dreams. From the fierce Motoko to the inventive Kaolla, the shy Shinobu, and the sake-loving Mitsune, Keitaro's life takes a dramatic turn as he tries to navigate this new world while keeping his promise. As he forms bonds with these women, he begins to wonder if one of them might be the girl from his past. Will Keitaro find the girl he promised to meet at Tokyo University, or will his life take an entirely different path? Only time will tell in this heartwarming and comedic tale of love, friendship, and perseverance.",
