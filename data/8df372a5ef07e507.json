    "text": "Xylo Forbartz, once a revered leader of the Holy Knights, now leads a motley crew of convictsâ€”criminals condemned to the fate of 'heroes,' forced to fight on the front lines against the demon king's army. In this brutal world, death is not an escape; instead, fallen heroes are resurrected to face the battlefield once more. When Xylo, accused of slaying a goddess, encounters another divine being, Teoritta, they forge a pact that could potentially reshape the world. As they navigate the treacherous landscape of war and intrigue, Xylo seeks vengeance against those who wronged him, while striving to survive and break the cruel cycle of death and rebirth. With the goddess's power at his side, Xylo embarks on a journey that may either save or doom the world. Witness the tale of a man determined to leave his past behind and embrace a new future!",
