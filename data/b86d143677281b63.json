    "text": "Misa and her son, Masato, live in a city shrouded in mystery, where the line between life and death is blurred. Meanwhile, Yuta and Mana, two immortals who gained their eternal life by consuming mermaid flesh, wander the world seeking a way to regain their mortality. As they journey, they offer aid to those in need, hoping to find a mermaid who can undo their immortal curse.\n\nWhen Yuta and Mana arrive in Masato's city, they stumble upon the boy's dark secret. Despite his cherubic appearance, Masato possesses mermaid flesh, and his bond with his mother is far from ordinary. As Yuta and Mana delve deeper into the enigma surrounding Masato and Misa, they discover that the boy's life hangs in the balance, and the truth may cost them their own lives.\n\nIn a world where mermaids are harbingers of both immortality and death, Yuta and Mana must navigate a tangled web of secrets to protect Masato and uncover the key to their own salvation. But as monstrous creatures begin to emerge, the stakes are raised, and the immortal duo must confront the true nature of their eternal existence.",
