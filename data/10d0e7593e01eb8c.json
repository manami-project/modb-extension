Despite his lackluster career and constant disagreements with his wife, he finds solace and joy in his beloved hobby.

Even his superiors, including the president of his company, are drawn to his magnetic personality and become his fishing students. Hama-chan's love for fishing transcends all boundaries, and he prioritizes it above all else, even if it means inviting the disapproval of those around him.
