    "text": "Ari is an earnest fifth grade student who enjoys helping others. On the first day of the new school year, Ari and her best friends Suha and Min decide to form an after-school \"Problem Solving Club\" to assist classmates in need. However, with no one asking for help just yet, the club struggles to find purpose. While heading home disappointed one day, Ari stumbles upon an unconscious hamster, who mysteriously begins speaking to her once she picks him up. The hamster claims he is searching for a magical ring to save his kingdom. Moved by his plight, Ari offers to help. Shortly after this fateful encounter, Ari discovers she has gained the power to temporarily transform into an adult with magical abilities. It becomes clear her newfound gifts are tied to the hamster's quest. Each time Ari utilizes her powers to kindly help other people, she gathers \"hopeful energy\" that can be transmitted to save the hamster's homeland. However, the evil Queen Canaby also seeks to exploit Ari's hopeful energy for her own selfish ends. With her friends and magical abilities by her side, courageous Ari must rise to the challenge to restore hope, both in the human world and in the hamster's magical kingdom.",
