Nozomi, a runaway with a secretive past, finds solace at the 'Stray Cats' confectionery, working as a pâtissière and gradually opening up to her newfound family.\n\nAs Takumi and his friends embark on various adventures, from starting a 'Stray Cats' club to help people to navigating the complexities of their relationships, they discover that life is anything but ordinary. Amidst the chaos, Takumi must unravel the mystery behind Nozomi's past and help Fumino confront her true feelings in this heartwarming love comedy.",
