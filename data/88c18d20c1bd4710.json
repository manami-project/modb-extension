    "text": "Yukari, an upperclassman, and Nanako, a high school girl with dreams of becoming an idol, find themselves becoming local idols, or 'Locodols,' for their town, Nagarekawa. At the request of Nanako's uncle, the pair form the idol unit 'Nagarekawa Girls' and use their talents to promote the town and its businesses. From interviews at shopping malls to appearances on local TV and small live events on department store rooftops, the girls work hard to boost their town's image. As they gain popularity, they are joined by Yui, the town's mascot, and Mirai, Yui's substitute. Despite the less-than-glamorous aspects of their new lifestyle, the girls find joy in being local idols and bringing attention to their beloved Nagarekawa.",
