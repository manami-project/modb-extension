  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Maya's brother, Shin Natsume, reigns supreme at Toudou Gakuen High School, where students form gangs and engage in martial arts battles to prove their strength. Despite Shin's friendly demeanor and apparent concern for his friends and sister, a dark secret lurks beneath his victorious facade. As Maya and her friend Mitsuomi strive to become stronger, they uncover a hidden world of intrigue and danger, with Shin at the center of it all.\n\n\"Tenjou Tenge: The Past Chapter\" is a condensed retelling of the flashback scenes from episodes 10-23 of the TV series, presented in movie form. This film omits the comedy elements and some leading characters from the series, resulting in a more dramatic and tragic tone. With shortened fights and a focus on the past, Mitsuomi and Maya must confront the horrors of Shin's secret history, which threatens to destroy them all. It's up to Mitsuomi to put an end to the chaos, as he believes only he can stop Shin.",
