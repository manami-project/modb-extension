    "text": "A meteor strike has devastated the world, leaving humanity's future uncertain. To ensure the survival of the human race, the government initiates the 7SEEDS project - placing select individuals into cryogenic sleep to be revived after the apocalypse has passed. Upon awakening, the 7SEEDS subjects find themselves in a harsh new world filled with giant insects, extreme weather, dangerous animals, and desperate fellow survivors willing to do anything to live another day. As the 7SEEDS forge ahead in this post-apocalyptic landscape, forging new bonds and overcoming perilous challenges, it becomes clear their mission is only just beginning. Rebuilding civilization from the ground up will require cooperation, ingenuity, and perseverance. But the future remains unwritten - will humanity rise to the occasion or fade to extinction? Only through trials by fire will the 7SEEDS discover if they have what it takes to inherit this brave new world.",
