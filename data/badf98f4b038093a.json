    "text": "What begins as a thrilling treasure hunt for five university students in the quiet summer break at Kikka University, quickly turns into a gruesome fight for survival when they stumble upon two ancient Italian mummies hidden deep within the library storage. Unbeknownst to them, the mummies harbor a powerful secret â€“ a mysterious stone that grants them superhuman strength and eternal life. When Sayaka, one of the students, snatches the stone from one of the mummies, she unwittingly awakens the vengeful spirits of Euphrosyne Studion and her maid, Alma V. Now resurrected as powerful zombies, the two mummies embark on a relentless pursuit to reclaim their stolen stone, leaving a trail of blood and terror in their wake. Trapped in the university building, the students must find a way to kill the zombie girls to escape. Will they outsmart the undead and survive, or fall victim to the wrath of the mummies?",
