  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kino's Journey follows a young traveler named Kino and a talking motorcycle named Hermes as they journey across a mystical world of many countries, each with its own unique customs. In each place they visit, Kino and Hermes observe the way the country's residents live, striving to understand their hopes, fears, dreams and failures. They learn about the diverse challenges these nations face, from moral dilemmas to technological issues to folk legends influencing society. As travelers merely passing through and not wanting to meddle, Kino and Hermes' time in each country is brief, usually only three days. Their goal is to explore new places and learn about different ways of life, while avoiding getting entangled in others' problems. Kino has an open mind, not judging the values of each nation as right or wrong, absurd or sensible. This is reflected by the overarching belief that \"the world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\" With its meditative atmosphere and thoughtful themes focused on self-discovery and universal truth, Kino's Journey uses its episodic structure to highlight the diversity of the lands through atmospheric slice-of-life storytelling rather than following a specific plot or action. It promises to be an imaginative and meaningful viewing experience.",
