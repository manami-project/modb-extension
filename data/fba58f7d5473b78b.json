    "text": "Easier said than done, the task of saving two worlds rests on the shoulders of the Magical King Munto. The Heavens, a collection of floating islands hidden beyond time and supported by the divine power of Akuto, is on the brink of collapse due to an energy crisis. As the other kingdoms in the Heavens conspire to seize the remaining Akuto, Munto embarks on a perilous journey to Earth in search of a mysterious girl shown to him by a seer.\n\nMeanwhile, Yumemi Hidaka, a young girl living on Earth, struggles to cope with her ability to see the floating islands that no one else can. With her best friend Ichiko Ono as her only confidant, Yumemi questions her own sanity. But when Munto suddenly appears before her, Yumemi's life takes an unexpected turn. As the Magical Kingdom nears its doom, Munto's quest to save both the Heavens and Earth becomes increasingly desperate. Will Yumemi be able to overcome her doubts and help Munto save both worlds, or will the Heavens fall from the sky? The fate of two worlds rests on their shoulders.",
