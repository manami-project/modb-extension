    "text": "Cybersix is a genetically engineered super-soldier created by the evil Dr. Von Reichter, a former Nazi scientist conducting horrific experiments. She is one of his \"Cyber\" creations exhibiting free will, so Von Reichter destroys them, but Cybersix escapes. Now hiding as Adrian Seidelman, a male high school teacher, Cybersix discovers her survival depends on a special substance from Von Reichter. By night in the city of Meridiana, she becomes a black leather-clad vigilante, battling Von Reichter's monstrous new creations called Technos to get this substance. Her allies are Data 7, a panther with the brain of her younger brother, and friends Lucas Amato, a colleague and love interest, Lori Anderson, a smitten student, and street urchin Julian. Cybersix wages a secret war against the diabolical plans of her creator while struggling to understand her identity. Can she protect her new life despite being hunted by Von Reichter? Will she give in to her non-human origins? Or can she embrace her humanity to defeat this threat?",
