    "text": "Game on! Meet Toua Tokuchi, a gambler and a baseball prodigy who's been ruling the roost in the high-stakes world of 'One Outs,' a one-on-one baseball duel between pitcher and batter. With a seemingly ordinary fastball that clocks in at just 134 kmph, Toua has racked up an impressive 499 victories, using his wit and cunning to outsmart his opponents.\n\nEnter Hiromichi Kojima, a celebrated slugger for the struggling Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, who's on a quest to find the secret ingredient to turn his team's fortunes around. In Okinawa, Kojima crosses paths with Toua and, captivated by his extraordinary skills, manages to recruit him for the Lycaons. However, Toua's not your average team player â€“ he strikes a unique 'One Outs' deal with the team's mercenary owner, Tsuneo Saikawa: every out Toua pitches earns him a whopping five million yen, but every run he concedes costs him a staggering fifty million yen.\n\nWith millions of yen hanging in the balance, Toua's psychological battles extend beyond the baseball diamond as he navigates the complex world of high-stakes gambling and professional sports. Can this maverick pitcher, who's spent his life gambling on a simplified version of baseball, lead a real team to victory and bring the Lycaons back from the brink of failure? Join Toua in this thrilling ride as he takes on the challenge of a lifetime!",
