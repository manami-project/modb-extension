  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With the relentless echo of gunfire and explosions, a fierce skirmish unfolds in the heart of a dense, foreboding forest. Armored tanks, mercilessly commanded, clash against formidable robotic machines, each pilot determined to outlast the other. Amidst this chaos, the grim specter of death looms large, and survival hinges on every split-second decision.\n\nAs the night wears on, the odds grow increasingly stacked against the combatants, with no reinforcements in sight and no escape route at hand. The battlefield becomes a chilling testament to the devastating price of failure, as the lifeless bodies of fallen soldiers litter the ground.\n\nMeanwhile, in the sterile confines of a hospital, a man teeters on the brink of life and death. As doctors race against time to save him, his mind remains trapped in the throes of his final battle. The memory of the brutal confrontation, punctuated by a hailstorm of bullets and the cold, unyielding efficiency of cutting-edge technology, refuses to release its hold on him.\n\nThis intense narrative forms the crux of a short film, meticulously crafted by Studio 4Â°C as part of the \"Grasshoppa\" collection. A poignant exploration of war, survival, and the indelible scars they leave behind, this anime promises a gripping and thought-provoking viewing experience.",
