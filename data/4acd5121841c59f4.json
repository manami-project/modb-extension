  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Thus, in the not-so-distant future of 2039, when androids have become as common as everyday electronics, we find Keiichiro, a solitary young man who has lost his family in a tragic car accident and has abandoned his passion for music. On a rainy day, he stumbles upon an outdated android model discarded in a garbage dump. Despite being told by a repair shop that the android is beyond repair, he brings her home, only to discover her making breakfast for him the next morning. Thus begins an unforgettable summer journey of an amnesiac android and a disheartened young man, both trying to find their place in the world. Originally an independent animation, Kowarekake no Orgel has now been adapted into a theatrical release, offering viewers a unique blend of emotion and introspection.",
