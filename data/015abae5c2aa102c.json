    "text": "Sana Hidaka, once a resident of the tranquil town of Sakuranomori, was compelled to leave his hometown and friends behind when his parents relocated to Tokyo for work. He held onto the belief that distance wouldn't diminish the cherished memories of his childhood friendships. Five years later, Sana returns as a high school student to find his hometown and friends significantly changed. Among them, Nanaka Yatsushiro, a childhood friend he once shared a close bond with, now seems distant and aloof. Despite her cold demeanor, she still wears the bracelet Sana gifted her years ago, hinting at lingering feelings. As Sana navigates his new life in his old town, he aims to rekindle his friendship with Nanaka while grappling with a haunting secret from his past.",
