  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sana Hidaka returns to his childhood hometown of Sakuranomori after five years of living in Tokyo. There, he reunites with his old friends - Aoi, the Wakatsuki twins Shuri and Shuusuke, and Nanaka. However, while the town itself hasn't changed much, his friends seem different. Nanaka in particular is no longer the cheerful girl Sana remembers. She has become gloomy and withdrawn. Even so, Sana notices she still wears the bracelet he gave her years ago, sparking hopes of reconnecting. As Sana settles back into life in Sakuranomori, he aims to rebuild his broken friendship with Nanaka and discover the reasons behind the changes in his old friends. Burdened by secrets from their past, can the bonds between this group be restored? Or will the shadows looming over the town tear their friendships apart forever? Full of nostalgia, this anime promises a bittersweet reunion story of childhood friends changed by time and tragedy. Yet with bonds once forged so strongly, the embers of friendship may still remain, ready to be rekindled.",
