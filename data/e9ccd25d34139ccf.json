    "text": "Queen Ramiris has aided Rimuru in stabilizing the condition of the children, allowing them to lead normal lives, much to his relief. However, not all is well in this fantasy world, as there are factions of humanity that are hostile towards a nation of monsters led by a slime. As Rimuru returns to his kingdom, Tempest, he faces rising tensions between humans and monsters, and encounters a formidable enemy unlike any he has faced before. Meanwhile, the Jura Tempest Federation, founded by Rimuru and his followers, has entered into agreements and trade with neighboring countries, making the dream of a nation where humans and monsters coexist a reality. But when faced with the harsh reality of anti-monster sentiment, Rimuru must make a choice to protect what he holds dear. The reincarnation story of Rimuru Tempest takes a thrilling new turn in its second season.",
