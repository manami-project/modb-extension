  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Many millennia ago, celestial beings, including the divine entity El Cantare, graced our solar system and birthed humanity on Venus. As global warming ravaged their home, humans sought refuge on Earth, where these godlike beings aided in the establishment of sophisticated civilizations. However, when a tyrannical king named Satan descends into Hell and begins misleading souls, El Cantare makes the noble decision to reincarnate on Earth, time and time again, to steer humanity back towards the light.\n\nThroughout history, El Cantare has been a beacon of hope and wisdom, guiding the lost civilizations of Mu, Atlantis, and the ancient Inca Empire. Alongside him, a group of individuals bear witness to his enlightened teachings and miraculous deeds, ultimately culminating in his final incarnation as Shakyamuni Buddha, bringing enlightenment to ancient India.\n\nThis sweeping spiritual anime film unveils the mysteries behind the creation of the universe and the divine reincarnations of El Cantare, providing a visual exploration of life's ultimate question: \"What is the purpose of the universe?\" As the second anime movie created for the Japanese cult Kyoufuku no Kagaku, prepare to delve into a world of pseudohistory and moral complexities.",
