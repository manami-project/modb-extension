  "synopsis": {
    "text": "18-year-old Makoto Katagiri had to drop out of middle school to work at a factory in order to support his younger sister Maaya. When Maaya fails to get into high school, the siblings both enroll in the same correspondence program. On their first day, Makoto has a fateful encounter with Rio Aizawa, the daughter of a prosperous family. Makoto and Rio come from vastly different backgrounds - he has battled hardship his whole life while she has been privileged. Their contrasting life experiences breed an initial rivalry. However, as the story unfolds, seeds of attraction and romance may blossom. This anime promises humor and drama as the tough, working-class Makoto crosses paths with the pampered and pedigreed Rio. Will their differences divide them or pave the way for an unlikely high school romance? Their story offers insight on social class while showing how love can bridge disparate worlds.",
