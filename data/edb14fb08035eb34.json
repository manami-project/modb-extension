  "synopsis": {
    "text": "During the third season of this chilling anime, an old man uses the traditional Japanese storytelling method of kamishibai to share eerie tales of urban legends and ghost stories with schoolchildren. Based on rumors and folklore throughout Japan's history, these picture-story animations showcase more than 100 bizarre characters and delve into the realm of the occult. A young boy brings these horrifying tales to life through his silent sketches, revealing gruesome secrets such as a hospital room with a hidden terror and a taxidermy museum shrouded in silence. With its distinctive art style and commitment to delivering creepy and gruesome stories, Yami Shibai 3 promises a thrilling and spine-tingling adventure for those who dare to watch.",
