  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yami Shibai is an animated Japanese horror anthology series that focuses on urban legends and ghost stories from throughout the country's history. Each episode features a mysterious old man who uses the traditional Japanese art of kamishibai (paper theater) to tell creepy tales to a group of schoolchildren. The upcoming third season promises over 100 new bizarre characters and stories, continuing the trend of bringing lesser-known scary Japanese folktales to life through striking visuals and an eerie atmosphere. Highlights include urban legends about a hospital room hiding a grim secret, a taxidermy museum with a foreboding silence, and a recurring nightmare about a muscular arm that must not be looked at. As with previous seasons, Yami Shibai 3 utilizes a distinctive art style inspired by kamishibai storytelling to create a visually arresting viewing experience that pulls the audience into a disquieting world of nightmares, ghosts, and the occult. Those with a taste for the macabre will surely be intrigued by this horror anthology's creepy aesthetic and exploration of the more sinister side of Japanese folklore.",
