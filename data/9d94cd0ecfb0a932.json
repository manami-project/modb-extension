    "text": "Tang San was once a prodigious disciple of the Tang Sect, dedicated to mastering the art of hidden weapons. However, in pursuit of the sect's deepest secrets, he committed an unforgivable act that was punishable by death. Accepting his fate, Tang San threw himself from the perilous Hell's Peak, fully expecting to die. Instead, he found himself reborn into the fantastical world of Douluo Dalu, where all people possess spirits that grant them incredible abilities. Excited by this new world, Tang San eagerly awaited the awakening of his spirit. Tragically, the spirit that emerged was the lowly Blue Silver Grass, regarded as useless by all. Undeterred, Tang San draws on his extensive combat knowledge and memories of his previous life to begin cultivating despite his disadvantage. Though the road ahead is long and arduous, Tang San is determined to defy expectations and become an esteemed Spirit Master in this mystical land. With cleverness and grit, this young blacksmith's son just may bring glory to the name of the Tang Sect once again.",
