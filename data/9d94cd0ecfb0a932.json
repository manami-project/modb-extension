Facing the consequences, he chose to plunge to his death from the treacherous Hell's Peak. But instead of meeting his end, he found himself reincarnated in a world known as Douluo Dalu, where every individual possesses a unique spirit. In this new world, those with powerful spirits can harness their spirit power to become formidable Spirit Masters. However, Tang San's awakened spirit is Blue Silver Grass, considered to be one of the weakest.
