  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Together, two young schoolgirls, San and Mayu, find themselves thrust into the brutal realities of World War II as they navigate the closing chapters of the Pacific War in Okinawa. Attending the most prestigious female school in the region, their lives take a dramatic turn when they, along with their classmates, are enlisted to serve as nurses for the Japanese army.\n\nAs the war intensifies, these adolescent girls are confronted with a far harsher and crueler world than they could have ever fathomed. Their story unfolds through the lens of the Himeyuri Corps, weaving together fact and fiction to create a gripping narrative that transcends the boundaries of time.\n\nWhen the unthinkable happens and they are ordered to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country, the remaining members of the group choose to defy their orders and escape. In doing so, they face the daunting challenges of surviving in a once idyllic tropical paradise that has been transformed into a nightmarish battlefield.\n\nThis poignant tale of friendship, courage, and resilience invites viewers to explore the past and engage in a deeper conversation about the realities of war. Through the eyes of these young girls, the story becomes a deeply personal journey that resonates with the audience and serves as a stark reminder of the human cost of conflict.",
