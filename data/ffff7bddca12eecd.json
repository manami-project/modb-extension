  "synopsis": {
    "text": "At Mei's residence, a delightful cookie-baking session is underway, with Aiko, Asami, and Nagi joining in. Simultaneously, Yamato and Kai reminisce about their shared past, while Momo subtly hints at Megumi's affection for Kai.\n\nIn this heartwarming anime episode, bundled with the 11th manga volume, we witness a charming day filled with cookies and nostalgia. As the baking process unfolds, Nagi playfully pushes Yamato out of the house, leading him to a rendezvous with Kai at a familiar park. This rundown park holds cherished memories for the duo, as it's where they first connected. Engaging in light-hearted banter, Kai inquires about Yamato's tendency to always be the first at the park after school. Yamato confesses his past struggle with identity, feeling like a chameleon adapting to please others. Kai, in turn, reveals his newfound appreciation for their town, thanks to Yamato's influence. Reassuring Yamato of his unique individuality, Kai triggers Yamato's realization of his loneliness before meeting Mei.\n\nLater, Kai encounters Megumi at a bus stop, commending her authenticity as a model, which leads to a misunderstanding. Megumi's regret for her harsh response becomes evident when Momo implies Megumi's fondness for Kai. Back at Mei's house, the cookies are ready, and the friends savor their delicious creation. Mei's mother gently nudges Mei and Yamato outside, where Yamato expresses his gratitude for Mei's companionship. Hand in hand, they watch a beautiful sunset before resuming their walk together.",
