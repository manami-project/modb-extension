  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Since his graduation, Duan Jiaze has been thrust into the unexpected role of managing a struggling private zoo, which he inherited. In an attempt to revive the business, he signs a peculiar contract, leading to the arrival of unconventional \"animals\" such as Luya, Daji, Bai Suzhen, and a black bear. The zoo, now known as Luya, becomes the first ever to enforce an age restriction, barring anyone under 21 years old from entering.\n\nWith the pressure of attracting more customers and keeping the zoo afloat, Duan Jiaze finds himself in a whirlwind of dreams about increased visitor traffic. Meanwhile, mythical creatures and spirits from a bygone era grow restless. Years later, Duan Jiaze finds himself in conversation with Luya at an annual meeting, reflecting on the unconventional path that led Luya to become a resident of the zoo.\n\nThe future of Lingyou Zoo hangs in the balance as Duan Jiaze and his extraordinary team of employees, including a sun crow, a nine-tailed fox, and a demon snake, strive to restore prosperity to the once-thriving establishment. Will they succeed in turning the tide and ensuring the survival of the zoo? Only time will tell.",
