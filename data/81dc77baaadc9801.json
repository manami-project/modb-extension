  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seoyeon Jin, a ruthless, demon-like woman with the power to control the Energy of Chaos, ended the life of Alka's master Hon without a shred of remorse. As a skilled assassin for the Clan of the Sword, Alka has learned to kill with the same cold detachment. However, her master's dying wish was for her to abandon her life of violence. Driven by a thirst for vengeance and the rules of her tribe, Alka embarks on a journey to find and confront Seoyeon Jin. Along the way, she meets three formidable female warriors, each with their own unique abilities.\n\nMeanwhile, the fragile peace that has lasted a millennium is under threat. The Wind Empire, a burgeoning power, seeks to overthrow the declining Stratus Empire and unite the four continents under a new banner of equality. However, their vision of unity is enforced through military might, causing further strife and division among the people. Amidst this turmoil, the ancient Darksiders reemerge, with Seoyeon Jin as their harbinger. With the world already torn apart by internal conflict, there may be no one left to stand against the Darksiders' wicked plans and save the world.\n\nThis anime is inspired by the popular Korean MMORPG 'Blade & Soul'.",
