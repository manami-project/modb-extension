  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dark Realm's once formidable and feared second-in-command, the Great Jahy, finds herself in an unexpected turn of events when a magical girl banishes her to the human world. Once living a life of opulence and power, Jahy now faces the harsh realities of poverty and survival in a world far removed from her own. With her powers diminished and her once-imposing figure reduced to that of a child, Jahy must navigate the challenges of human life, including working at a bar and living in a cramped apartment. Despite these hardships, Jahy remains resolute in her ambition to restore the Dark Realm to its former glory, embarking on a quest to reassemble the shattered mana crystal that once powered her world. Filled with humor, resilience, and a touch of the supernatural, \"The Great Jahy Will Not Be Defeated!\" is a testament to the indomitable spirit of its titular character.",
