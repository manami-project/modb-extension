  "synopsis": {
    "text": "However, in the bustling city of Edo, where the once-proud samurai now struggle to find their place, one silver-haired man named Gintoki Sakata refuses to let go of his samurai spirit. In a world dominated by advanced alien technology and a sword ban, Gintoki runs a small business called Yorozuya, taking on odd jobs with the help of his motley crew: Shinpachi Shimura, a bespectacled boy with a passion for the samurai way; Kagura, a feisty girl with superhuman strength and an insatiable appetite; and Sadaharu, a colossal pet dog with a penchant for head-biting. From encounters with extraterrestrial royalty to skirmishes with local gangs, the Yorozuya team embarks on unpredictable adventures, striving to make ends meet and, perhaps, make the world a slightly better place. But don't be fooled by Gintoki's laid-back demeanor and love for sweets; beneath the surface lies the heart of a true samurai. Join Gintoki and his friends as they navigate the challenges and absurdities of life in this alien-occupied world, where the old ways clash with the new.",
