  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jin's popular vocaloid song series follows the members of the 'Mekakushi-dan' secret club. With emotive songs performed by vocaloids IA and Miku, the anime explores the interwoven stories and abilities of the red-eyed teenagers. The first video, Yobanashi Deceive, centers on Shuuya Kano, a natural-born liar whose shapeshifting red eyes let him disguise himself however he likes. But who is the real Kano behind the lies and masks? Lost Time Memory looks at Shintarou Kisaragi, haunted by past regrets and struggling to move forward. At a crossroads, will he overcome his anguish or remain trapped in memories? Finally, Ayano no Koufuku Riron shows Ayano Tateyama happily adopting three red-eyed orphans into her family. To protect their happiness, she gifts them red scarves and starts the Mekakushi-dan club to embrace their abilities. With imaginative animation and an emotional musical core, Jin's series intricately explores identity, memory, and the bonds between the Mekakushi-dan members.",
