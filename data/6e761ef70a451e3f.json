  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This abstract animation explores the theme of 'one continues to live, leaving his trace'. The visuals consist of repetitive pencil drawings and erasures on paper that create an illusionary sense of movement. This minimalist technique aims to reflect the ephemeral yet impactful nature of life. Created in 2013 by director Saki Nakano during her first year at the Tokyo University of the Arts' Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation, the piece invites viewers to contemplate legacy, memory, and our lasting imprint on the world around us. With imaginative visuals and a thought-provoking message, it promises to be a unique and captivating viewing experience.",
