  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime, directed by Saki Nakano, explores the profound theme of life's enduring traces through an innovative approach to abstract animation. Crafted meticulously during Nakano's first year at Tokyo University of the Arts in 2013, the animation unfolds through a mesmerizing sequence of pencil drawings and erasures on a single piece of paper. As the drawings take shape and dissolve, they echo the transient yet impactful nature of life's journey. The sound design by Yasutake HIRAI and production by Koji YAMAMURA further enrich the experience, making it a compelling watch for those who appreciate thought-provoking narratives and unconventional storytelling techniques.",
