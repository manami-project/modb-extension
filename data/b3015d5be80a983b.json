  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime \"Otokojuku\" centers around an unusual private school designed for juvenile delinquents who have been expelled from traditional educational institutions. This school specializes in teaching Japanese chivalry, drawing from both feudal and military principles. The learning environment is intense and action-packed, with a high level of violence that mirrors an action movie. Only the strongest and most resilient students will survive and graduate, thereby proving their manhood.\n\nThe anime is an adaptation of a manga bearing the same title. Initially, the series presents a comedic tone, but as the narrative progresses, it shifts towards a more serious and action-oriented theme. Among the diverse student body, several standout characters emerge, including Momotarou, a first-year student known for his wisdom and swordsmanship, Ryuji, a student driven by his insatiable appetite, and Genji, a fearless street fighter. In this school, where unconventional methods like carrying a 200 kg load for six months as punishment are the norm, these young men find the perfect setting to hone their masculinity, chivalry, and combat skills.",
