  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around a group of sextuplet brothers with the surname Matsuno. One day, the six Matsuno brothers wake up to find their daily routine unexpectedly altered. What follows is a day filled with amusing and strange events for the siblings. The anime's first Blu-Ray and DVD volume contains a special replacement episode instead of the normal episode one. This new episode consists of two short stories. The first short, titled \"Matsu Soup,\" focuses on the Matsuno brothers waking up to an unusual morning which leads into an out-of-the-ordinary day for them. The second short, \"Virgin Hero,\" involves brother Choromatsu feeling insecure after observing a group of carefree college students. Overall, the anime is a comedy following the humorous daily lives of sextuplet brothers and their interactions. The replacement episode offers more wacky adventures for the siblings, with one short providing a change-of-pace story involving self-confidence issues. Fans can look forward to amusing tales of camaraderie and family.",
