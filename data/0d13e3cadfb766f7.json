    "text": "Blu-Ray and DVD enthusiasts of Osomatsu-san are in for a treat with the first volume, as it features a brand-new episode that substitutes the original first episode. This fresh addition, often labeled as 'episode 3.5,' finds its place right after the third episode in the series. The new episode comprises two delightful segments, 'Matsu-jiru' and 'Douteina Hero.'\n\nIn 'Matsu-jiru,' the Matsuno boys wake up to an unusual morning, marking the beginning of an extraordinary day for them. 'Douteina Hero' follows Choromatsu as he stumbles upon college students having a barbecue, leaving him feeling somewhat out of place in their sophisticated world. As the story unfolds, a surprising revelation comes to light.\n\nThis exciting new content is sure to captivate fans of the series, providing a fresh perspective on the beloved characters while maintaining the show's signature humor and charm. Don't miss out on this unique addition to the Osomatsu-san universe!",
