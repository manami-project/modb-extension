  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There's a magical realm called Alfheimr, where the young succubus princess Astarotte Ygvar, or Lotte as she's affectionately known, is about to reach a critical milestone. As a succubus, Lotte must form a harem of men to replenish her magic and maintain her health. However, she harbors a deep-seated dislike for men, a sentiment that could put her life in peril as she matures. To help her overcome this aversion, her attendant Judith Snorrevik embarks on a journey to the human realm, Midgard, and returns with a single father, Naoya Touhara.\n\nNaoya, who finds himself in the middle of this fantastical world, agrees to join Lotte's harem on one condition: he wants to bring his daughter Asuha with him. Despite Lotte's initial reluctance, she eventually agrees, and Naoya begins to help her navigate her way into adulthood. His caring and considerate nature, devoid of any sexual intent, slowly starts to soften Lotte's heart towards men.\n\nHowever, when Asuha finally arrives in Alfheimr, Lotte's relationship with Naoya takes a turn for the worse. Despite this, Naoya remains committed to mending their relationship and fulfilling his role in Lotte's life. As he continues to bond with Lotte, he begins to uncover the hidden connections that bind him to this enchanting world, suggesting that his arrival in Alfheimr may not have been a mere coincidence.",
