  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime spotlights the comedic clash of generations in a Japanese toy company, Popuu. At the heart of the story is Yutori, a vibrant high school student navigating her first job as a part-time worker. She's supervised by Tsumekomi, a dedicated office worker in her late twenties, who strives to instill professional values in Yutori, despite her unconventional and self-centered behavior. Adding to the mix is Dankai, a middle-aged regular employee, who brings a different perspective to the table. As these three characters, each representing distinct Japanese generations, work together, they create a lively and entertaining office environment filled with misunderstandings and unexpected camaraderie.",
