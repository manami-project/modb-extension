  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around a kind-hearted duke who has been cursed since childhood - anything he touches dies. This curse makes his interactions with others, especially his flirtatious maid Alice, extremely complicated. Though their deepening fondness suggests romance, they cannot physically express their affection. The duke races against time to break this curse, as his inheritance hangs in the balance. His mother has given him until spring to undo the curse, lest his brother Walter assume the dukedom. Aided by his witch friends Zain and Cuff, the duke desperately seeks the witch who cursed him years ago. But the friends have curses and problems of their own. They've managed to hide their magical talents while working incognito at the Circus Gemini, but struggle to keep their true identities concealed. As the threat of the spring deadline approaches, the duke refuses to expose his friends in his frantic search for clues. Torn between responsibilities to his legacy and loyalty to his loved ones, he tries to balance enjoying the hilarious antics of daily life while hunting for the witch. Can he break the curse without betraying those he holds most dear?",
