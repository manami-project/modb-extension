  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tooru Taki's classmate, Takashi Natsume, possesses a unique ability to communicate with spirits known as Youkai. He inherited the \"Book of Friends\" from his late grandmother, Reiko, which holds the names of Youkai that she had previously controlled. Now, Takashi, accompanied by his Youkai protector and advisor Madara (also known as \"Nyanko-sensei\"), aims to return these names to their rightful owners.\n\nOne day, a seemingly ordinary delivery leads Takashi to a village where he encounters Yorie Tsumura, a woman from Reiko's past. This chance meeting sets off a series of events, leading to the splitting of Nyanko-sensei into three kittens after consuming a mysterious fruit from a \"Spirit Seed.\" As Takashi and his friends search for a solution to Nyanko-sensei's predicament, they uncover hidden secrets about the town and Takashi's grandmother.\n\nAlong the way, Takashi reunites with an old classmate, Yuki, which stirs up painful memories of a particular Youkai. Despite the challenges, Takashi finds solace in spending time with Yorie and her son, Mukuo. However, a mysterious Youkai lurks in their town, and Takashi must navigate the complexities of both human and Youkai worlds to restore balance and help those in need.",
