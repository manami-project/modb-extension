    "text": "Tokyo Ghoul: Hibi revolves around the unusual encounter between high school students, Shuu Tsukiyama and Chie Hori. Unbeknownst to most, Shuu is a 'ghoul', a creature with a taste for human flesh. One night, as he prepares to indulge in his grisly meal, a flash of light interrupts him. The source? A camera wielded by none other than Chie, who inadvertently captures Shuu's true nature in a chilling photograph.\n\nAs fate would have it, Chie and Shuu are not only classmates but also develop an intriguing bond following their unsettling introduction. Shuu's initial motivation to protect his secret identity shifts into a morbid fascination with the eccentric Chie. As their relationship deepens, Shuu challenges both of them to delve into each other's vastly different worlds. With Shuu's promise of a superior photograph, Chie embarks on a dangerous journey to uncover the truth behind the ghoul's existence.",
