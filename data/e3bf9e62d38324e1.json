  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shuu Tsukiyama is a ghoul - a creature who feeds on human flesh - who enjoys savoring his grisly meals. His indulgent routine is interrupted one night when aspiring photographer Chie Hori snaps a perfectly timed photo capturing Shuu reveling over a fresh kill. This incriminating evidence threatens to expose his true monstrous identity. Shuu and Chie both attend the same high school, though oblivious Chie remains unafraid even after learning his secret. Morbidly curious about her nonchalant reaction, Shuu draws closer, challenging them to delve deeper into each other's alien worlds. He promises that Chie will obtain an even more impactful photo if she accompanies him on his nightly hunts. As this unlikely pair spends more time together, the line blurs between predator and prey. Will Chie emerge from this macabre relationship unscathed, or will she become Shuu's next meal? One thing is certain - she will never look at the world the same way again.",
