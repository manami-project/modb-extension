As the comet's light illuminates the world, a relentless army of viruses wreaks havoc across the globe. Netto and Rockman.EXE, fresh off their battle against Dr. Regal and Nebula, find themselves face-to-face with this new menace. As they attempt to intervene using cross fusion, they are transported to an unfamiliar realm, only to come face-to-face with Duo, the orchestrator of this chaos. With Earth in peril, can Netto and Rockman.EXE prove to Duo that the planet is not consumed by darkness, but rather home to a vast amount of goodness?
