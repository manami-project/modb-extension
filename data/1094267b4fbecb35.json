However, Roboly realizes there is one crucial \"important thing\" she cannot make on her own. Longing to discover what this missing piece is, she embarks on a journey with her robot bird companion Koto. Along the way, Roboly finds a music box and arrives in Anpanman's world seeking its owner. During her time getting to know Anpanman and his friends, Roboly experiences a strange new sensation - a warmth growing in her chest. As she struggles to understand these first fledgling feelings, her connection with Anpanman deepens. Meanwhile, the villainous Baikinman has created a powerful new mecha called Roboking with plans to wreak havoc on Comet Robo. Anpanman and his allies race to protect Roboly's home while she continues her personal quest to find that mysterious \"important thing\" she seeks. Through this touching adventure, Roboly may at last come to grasp the deeper meaning of friendship, courage and what it truly means to have a heart.",
