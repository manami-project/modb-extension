The OVA brings to life five of the most beloved characters from the series: Riona Kisaragi, Yuki Shihoudou, Nana Morimura, Asuka Senou, and Mai Kannazuki.\n\nEach of these captivating women harbors intriguing secrets, which they reveal through their individual narratives. Mai, for instance, delves into the alluring aesthetics of a woman's legs when she bends down, while Nana, a maid by profession, shares her unsettling feeling of being watched. Riona, on the other hand, expresses her excitement for the color red and showcases various ways a woman can sit. Yuki, in her daring nature, dons revealing outfits for her lover, and Asuka finds herself in a provocative roleplay scenario with a female doctor at the hospital.\n\nThese stories unfold as monologues, offering glimpses into the women's past erotic encounters. The OVA promises an engaging and enticing experience, weaving together these unique narratives into a captivating tapestry of stories.",
