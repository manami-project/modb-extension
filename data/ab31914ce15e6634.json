The final round of the 12th IGPX is about to witness the determination of young amateur pilots led by Takeshi, who form Team Suzaku.

As Team Suzaku steps into the arena against the formidable Team Sledge Mamma, will they be able to prove their mettle and achieve their dream of becoming the greatest IG team ever, or will their lack of funds and experience stand in their way? Only the Immortal Grand Prix can decide their fate.",
