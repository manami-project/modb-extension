  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tori Aoi and his fellow students find themselves in a critical juncture in a world where humans have returned to a devastated Earth after abandoning it for the celestial realm of Tenjo. With Earth left uninhabitable except for the Shinshu area, humans recreate a parallel world, Juso Sekai, to accommodate the overflowing population. As they attempt to restore Tenjo and the law of causation by recreating history from 10,000 BC, a war in 1413 AD causes Juso Sekai to collide with the original world.\n\nIn this strange new world, only the islands of Japan remain habitable, and the nations of the world compete for power, each wielding an ultimate weapon known as the Roysmoi Opro. With the Testament, a guide to help humanity return to the skies, ending abruptly, rumors of an impending apocalypse begin to circulate.\n\nNow, in the final year, Tori Aoi and his friends aboard the aerial metropolitan ship Musashi must unravel the mystery of the Horizon in the Middle of Nowhere and challenge the course of destiny. Will they find a way to prevent the end of humanity, or will they succumb to the inevitable? Join Tori Aoi and his companions as they navigate this perilous journey to uncover the truth and save their world.",
