    "text": "Much of the Earth's population has been decimated by enigmatic beasts known as 'Huge.' In response, humanity unites to create a powerful weapon called 'CHARM' (Counter Huge Arms), a fusion of science and magic. The most effective wielders of CHARM are adolescent girls, who are hailed as heroes known as 'Lilies.' These Lilies are trained at specialized military academies called 'Gardens,' which also serve as bases for protection and guidance. This is the tale of young girls striving to become Lilies and protect the world from the Huge at one such Garden. Among them are Riri Hitotsuyanagi and Yuyu Shirai, who share a unique bond and a common goal to become Lilies and save humanity.",
