  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese society is under constant threat from colossal monsters known as Kaiju. Kafka Hibino, once an aspiring Kaiju fighter, finds himself working for a company that cleans up the aftermath of Kaiju battles. Alongside his childhood friend, Mina Ashiro, he had pledged to join the Defense Force and protect humanity from these monstrous creatures. However, life took them on separate paths, with Mina now serving as a captain in the Defense Force while Kafka's dreams remain unfulfilled.\n\nWhen Kafka encounters Reno Ichikawa, a determined young man who shares the same aspirations, his dormant ambition is rekindled. Reno's unwavering resolve to join the Defense Force serves as a reminder of Kafka's own forgotten promise. But just as Kafka begins to reconsider his future, an unexpected Kaiju encounter leaves him infected with a parasite, granting him extraordinary abilities.\n\nNow, with the power of a Kaiju coursing through his veins, Kafka—dubbed \"Kaiju No. 8\"—finds himself with a second chance to fulfill his childhood promise. Alongside Reno, he embarks on a journey to join the Defense Force, determined to stand by Mina's side and protect humanity from the ever-looming Kaiju threat.",
