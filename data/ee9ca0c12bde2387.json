    "text": "Technology still eludes them, but the Angel Troupe is back with a new member and a renewed determination! Chitose Karasuma, the latest addition to the team, joins Milfeulle, Ranpha, Vanilla, Mint, and Forte on their quest to uncover the elusive Lost Technology. As they navigate through a series of unpredictable escapades, the Angels face challenges that range from extraterrestrial physicians to ticking time bombs, and even enigmatic murder mysteries.\n\nWhile Chitose's struggle to form bonds often leads to discord and skepticism within the group, their mission to bring joy to a terminally ill patient reveals a softer side to the Angels. However, once the initial empathy fades, the team grapples with the complexities of their new dynamic. Will Chitose's presence strengthen the Angel Troupe, or will internal conflicts jeopardize their search for the coveted technology? Only time will tell as this unconventional team continues their thrilling and often hilarious journey!",
