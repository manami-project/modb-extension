    "text": "Hiroshi Aramata's novel-inspired anime, \"Reign: The Conqueror,\" also known as \"Alexander Senki,\" debuted in 1999, offering a unique interpretation of Alexander the Great's life. This groundbreaking international production united the talents of the global adult animation community, with Korean-American animator Peter Chung designing the characters and settings, and Korean animators handling most of the production work.\n\nBorn as Prince Alexander to King Philip II, the young heir to the Macedonian Empire must navigate treacherous political waters, thwart assassination attempts, and overcome his father's envy to claim his rightful place on the throne. Upon becoming king, Alexander embarks on a relentless quest for global domination, aspiring to be recognized as the Great King.\n\nHowever, an ancient prophecy looms over Alexander's ambitions, foretelling that he will become the world's destroyer, remembered as the Devil King. In 356 BC, Alexander's fateful journey unfolds, leading him to confront Darius the Third in a cataclysmic war with Persia. As Alexander embraces his dark destiny, he transforms into the very devil he was prophesied to become, leaving devastation in his wake and potentially sealing his own doom.",
