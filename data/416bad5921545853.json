  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ayumu is a young boy spending the summer with his father in the rural town of Tana. Though initially reluctant, Ayumu agrees to go in exchange for a mountain bike from his mother. Upon arriving, Ayumu notices strange events - flowers blooming oddly, ghost stories swirling, and an encounter with a mysterious boy named Wakkun. Meanwhile, Kisa is a lonely high school girl in Yokohama who has shut herself off from the world. One night, Kisa discovers an injured, egg-shaped machine that seems alive. Naming it Bun-chan, Kisa is unaware of the chaos it may bring. As Ayumu searches for answers about Wakkun and the odd lights, and Kisa connects with the odd Bun-chan, both will discover that isolation can leave one vulnerable to the mysterious and unknown. Their encounters with these strange forces will begin to open their eyes to truths about themselves and the world around them.",
