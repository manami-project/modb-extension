  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a calamitous event known as The Oblivion, China's once spirit-filled land lost its magical energy overnight, leaving the powerful exorcists powerless and relegated to the annals of history. In the war-torn era of the Qin and Jin Kingdoms, the bitter spirits of the fallen rise, awakening the dreaded Great Diablo, a millennial demon. To thwart this catastrophic resurgence, Chen Xing, the world's last exorcist, embarks on a perilous quest with the Lamp of the Heart, a mystical artifact residing within his soul. His mission: to locate Xiangshu, the prophesied ally who will aid him in vanquishing the demon.\n\nIn this dark age where spiritual energy has faded into obscurity, a glimmer of hope emerges in the form of a 16-year-old boy. With a prophecy foretelling his demise on his twentieth birthday, he takes on the monumental task of restoring the celestial and terrestrial magical currents to save the Divine Land from impending doom. As ominous enemies gather and the end of the world looms, the young hero faces insurmountable odds in his four-year race against time.",
