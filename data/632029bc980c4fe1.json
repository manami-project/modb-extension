  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The kingdom of Antifarnia is under siege by the undead legions of the Demon King, leaving its army decimated and its people in despair. Amidst the chaos, the king's daughter is kidnapped by a monstrous creature and held captive in a heavily fortified castle. Just when all hope seems lost, the melodic notes of a violin echo through the air, heralding the arrival of four unlikely heroes.\n\nHamel, a skilled violinist, and his companions - Raeil, a talented pianist, Flute, a powerful magess, and Sizer, a fearless female warrior - stumble upon the besieged kingdom during their quest to defeat the Demon King. Informed of the princess's kidnapping, the quartet of heroes bravely volunteers to rescue her from her monstrous captor.\n\nHowever, the task proves to be more challenging than they initially anticipated, as the castle is heavily guarded and teeming with danger. With their unique skills and unyielding determination, the four heroes must overcome the seemingly insurmountable odds and save the princess before it's too late. Little do they know, their actions may very well tip the scales in the battle against the Demon King himself.",
