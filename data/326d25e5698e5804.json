  "synopsis": {
    "text": "His name is Vash the Stampede, a notorious gunslinger with a bounty of 60 billion double-dollars on his head, making him a constant target for bounty hunters and causing chaos in every town he visits. Despite the destruction he leaves in his wake, there's no evidence that Vash has ever taken a life, which seems odd for such an infamous outlaw. Instead, Vash is a pacifist with an insatiable love for doughnuts, who would rather avoid violence than engage in it.\n\nTasked with keeping Vash under surveillance and minimizing the damage caused by his pursuers are Meryl Stryfe and Milly Thompson, two insurance agents who find it hard to believe that this spiky-haired, gangly young man could be the legendary gunman they've been sent to find. However, as they delve deeper into Vash's past, they discover that there's more to him than meets the eye.\n\nAs Vash's journey through the desert wasteland of Gunsmoke continues, he must confront his past and face a group of legendary assassins who seek to bring suffering to him and those around him. With his principles and morality put to the test, Vash must find a way to protect his newfound friends and stay true to his pacifist beliefs.",
