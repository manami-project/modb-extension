    "text": "To prevent the resurrection of Anthrasax, the god of destruction who once plunged the world into chaos, a young priestess named Yoko must enlist the help of the notorious and lecherous sorcerer, Dark Schneider. Sealed within the body of a 14-year-old boy, Dark Schneider is released by Yoko's kiss in the hopes of thwarting his former companions, the Four Divine Kings, who seek to revive Anthrasax and recreate the world. However, Dark Schneider's chaotic and unpredictable nature may prove to be more trouble than Yoko bargained for, as he is determined to fulfill his own desires and conquer the world. With the fate of the world hanging in the balance, Yoko must find a way to control Dark Schneider and stop the Four Divine Kings before it's too late.",
