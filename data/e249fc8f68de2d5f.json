  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Candy is an orphan girl living at the Pony Home orphanage. As an infant, she was found abandoned in the snow near the orphanage, and the sisters gave her the name Candy. She is a spirited and rambunctious girl who often gets into mischief. Tragedy begins to strike when Candy's good friend Anne is adopted from the orphanage. Soon after, Candy herself is also adopted, but not into a loving family - rather, she is to be a companion to a girl named Elisa from a wealthy household. The story follows Candy's experiences after her adoption. She navigates her first love as well as cruelty from her new family. The movie summarizes the key events from the television series but with some differences - for example, Candy meets a prince rather than her love interest from the original story. The movie also has an alternate, happy ending compared to the series. Overall, Candy is a hopeful and resilient orphan whose life takes an unexpected turn when she leaves the orphanage. Despite facing hardships with her new family, the story suggests she finds some brightness in her life.",
