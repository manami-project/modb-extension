    "text": "Madoka finds herself back in Kamogawa after struggling to pilot Midori, just in time to celebrate the New Year. As she settles back into her routine, she receives heartfelt letters from her friends Lan and Muginami, who share their recent adventures. Madoka promptly responds to these letters, eager to maintain their connection.\n\nAs the year progresses and Madoka advances a grade in school, Lan and Muginami take a trip to the tourist planet Polyhedron. Here, they discover an intergalactic replica of Kamogawa, a nostalgic reminder of their shared past. This anime interlude takes place between the first and second seasons, offering a glimpse into the characters' lives during their time apart.\n\nMeanwhile, Youko is engaged in a mysterious mission, scouring the seabed for an unknown object. Back in Kamogawa, Madoka resumes her Jersey Club activities, while Lan and Muginami assist their brothers in ruling their respective territories on Polyhedron. In a touching gesture, they even go shopping for Madoka's birthday. This slice-of-life narrative offers a refreshing break from the main storyline, highlighting the characters' personal growth and enduring friendships.",
