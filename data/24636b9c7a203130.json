  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is the latter half of Universal Century 0096. The Earth Federation government feels threatened by the mysterious Psycho Frame technology and orders Lieutenant Mehmet Merka to investigate. Merka assembles a covert team called Mastima and is sent to infiltrate Axis, an abandoned asteroid base drifting near Earth. Accompanying Merka are two civilians with Zeon ties - Arlette Almage, a former engineer, and Danton Hyleg, an ex-test pilot. Once inside Axis, Mastima is ambushed by Gundams deployed by Birnam, a rogue private militia somehow operating within the vacant base. Arlette and Danton fight back using a customized Zaku mobile suit they helped develop. During the fighting, Arlette breaks away, secretly seeking the remains of the legendary Zeon mobile suit Sazabi, which lies dormant on Axis after the last war. What new threat does Birnam pose? Can Axis hold the key to unlocking the mysteries of the Psycho Frame? As the battle rages on, the stakes continue to rise.",
