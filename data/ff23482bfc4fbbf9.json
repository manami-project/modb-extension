  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Star pitcher Haruka Kiyomine and skilled catcher Kei Kaname were an invincible battery in middle school, crushing the dreams of aspiring players across Japan. But when Kei suffers amnesia, losing his baseball skills and memory of playing, the two enroll at Tokyo Municipal Kotesashi High School instead of an elite baseball academy. At this little-known school with a newly founded club, they unexpectedly reunite with former rivals like Tarou Yamada, who gave up baseball after being crushed by Haruka and Kei. Though Kei can't remember playing, Haruka is determined to pitch to him again. He forces Kei and Tarou to join Kotesashi's scrappy team. Hilarious antics ensue as hotheaded Haruka tries pushing aloof Kei to relearn catching, while the team of has-beens seeks to recapture their passion for baseball. Can this ragtag club help Kei recover his skills and memory? Will the infamous battery duo lead Kotesashi to victory and redemption? Get ready for fierce rivalries, wacky humor, and maybe even new dreams as the baseball story begins anew!",
