After a failed attempt to dethrone the dance king, Bureikin was stripped of his Dance Stones, the source of his dance power, and banished to the human world. To regain his lost power, Bureikin embarks on a mission to collect all the Dance Stones scattered across Earth. However, chaos ensues as the Dance Stones wreak havoc in the human world. To combat this, Bureikin merges with Hibiki, transforming them into a formidable Dance Hero, determined to retrieve the Dance Stones and restore order.",
