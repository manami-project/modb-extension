  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Xabungle unfolds on the lawless planet of Zora, where a unique rule allows individuals to keep stolen goods if they can evade capture for three days. Amidst this chaos, Jiron Amos, a determined young man, seeks vengeance against the outlaw responsible for his parents' murder. However, the three-day rule and the advanced society of the 'Innocent' pose significant obstacles to his quest for justice.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, Jiron sets his sights on stealing Xabungle, a state-of-the-art mecha owned by the powerful merchant, Carring Cargo. In his pursuit, Jiron joins forces with the Sandrats, a notorious motorcycle gang, and finds himself embroiled in a larger conflict between the oppressed 'Civilians' and the privileged 'Innocent'. As Jiron's quest for revenge intensifies, it sparks a rebellion that could forever alter the balance of power on Zora.",
