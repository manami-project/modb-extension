  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the desert planet Zora, there exists a stark divide between the technologically advanced \"Innocent\" who live in comfortable domed cities, and the oppressed \"Civilians\" who must scrape by in the harsh wilderness. Civilian Jiron Amos has long harbored a personal vendetta against the Innocent outlaw Timp Sharon, who murdered his parents yet evaded justice due to the planet's three-day statute of limitations on crimes. When Jiron crosses paths with the rowdy Sandrat biker gang, he sees an opportunity to finally get revenge by stealing the powerful Xabungle robot walker from merchant Carrying Cargo's bazaar. After kidnapping Cargo's daughter Elchi, Jiron and the Sandrats form an unlikely alliance standing up to injustice. Their personal battles soon ignite into a full-blown rebellion, as for the first time the downtrodden Civilians unite to challenge the Innocent's tyrannical rule over planet Zora.",
