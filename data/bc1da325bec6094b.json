  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Over in a quaint West Coast town, Harry McQuinn, an atypical American teenager, finds himself in the throes of adolescence. He's socially awkward, paranoid, and friendless, but beneath his unassuming exterior lies an extraordinary secret. Harry possesses telekinetic powers that he neither believes in nor consciously controls.\n\nWhen Harry unexpectedly saves his classmate Catherine from bullies, he inadvertently reveals his unique abilities. As they grow closer, Harry demonstrates his telekinetic powers to Catherine, but unbeknownst to him, there's a sinister catch: every time he uses his powers, someone nearby dies.\n\nAs video evidence of his abilities surfaces, Harry finds himself in the crosshairs of a clandestine organization and the local police. As the stakes escalate, Harry must navigate the perilous waters of his newfound powers and the ominous forces vying to exploit them, all while grappling with the deadly consequences of his abilities.",
