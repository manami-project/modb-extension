    "text": "Hikaru Amagi believed herself to be an ordinary high school girl, spending her days crushing on boys, hanging out with friends, and enjoying pop culture. However, her world is turned upside down when she discovers that she is actually an alien princess from the distant planet Gran. As the inheritor of the legendary Royal Armor, Hikaru possesses incredible power. This power attracts the attention of an invading alien force intent on capturing the armor to further their galactic conquest. They send a massive battle robot to retrieve the armor, attacking Hikaru's hometown in the process. To protect everything she holds dear, Hikaru must embrace her extraterrestrial heritage. By transforming into the Hyper Speed GranDoll, she gains the strength to confront the invading aliens head-on. Though uncertain of her newfound duties, Hikaru resolves to master the Royal Armor and serve as the last line of defense for both Earth and the universe at large.",
