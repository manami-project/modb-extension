  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After receiving an invitation from Professor Oak, young Pokémon trainer Ash attends the opening ceremony of Professor Sakuragi's new research lab in Vermillion City. There, Sakuragi receives word of a rare Pokémon appearing in the harbor - the legendary Lugia. Ash rushes to the harbor along with other trainers, hoping to observe or even battle the elusive Lugia. Upon finding Lugia engaged in confrontation with some trainers, Ash commands his partner Pikachu to strike Lugia with Thunderbolt. Lugia appears unaffected and quickly flees, but not before Ash courageously leaps onto its back mid-flight. To Ash's surprise, another ambitious young trainer named Gou has done the same. The two ride on Lugia's back as it transports them on a thrilling ocean voyage. When Lugia finally returns them to land, Ash and Gou part ways with the majestic Pokémon. Their daring encounter leaves quite an impression on Professor Sakuragi, who asks them to become research fellows at his new institute. Excited by the prospect of exploring new regions and discovering rare Pokémon, the two trainers embark on an epic journey across the Pokémon world. They meet fascinating new creatures like the Gigantamax Snorlax and even some Mythical Pokémon. With boundless curiosity and determination, Ash and Gou experience the adventure of a lifetime in their quest to better understand these wondrous pocket monsters.",
