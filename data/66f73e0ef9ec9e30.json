  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Teekyuu follows four high school girls who are members of their school's eccentric tennis club. Despite their nominal interest in tennis, the girls—Kanae, Nasuno, Marimo, and junior member Yuri—spend most of their time goofing off together. Kanae is easily bored and often causes chaos through her rule-breaking antics. The wealthy Nasuno can get her way with money. Marimo has unusual habits like eating panties or kidnapping kids. Yuri is the most normal and mature of the group, though she often has to rein in her silly seniors. When these wildly different personalities come together, hilarity and insanity ensues. The girls embark on hilarious misadventures that frequently involve Marimo's perverted tendencies, Nasuno solving problems with her wealth, Kanae wreaking havoc, and poor Yuri trying to be the voice of reason. While they occasionally play tennis, their club is mostly an excuse to have fun. With its zany characters and rapid-fire comedy, Teekyuu offers a madcap take on high school life.",
