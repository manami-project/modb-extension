  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Xie Lian is a fallen god who was once a revered Crown Prince in the heavenly realms. However, after a series of mishaps and misfortunes, he loses the faith and worship of humans on earth. As a result, Xie Lian descends to the mortal realm to wander without aim or purpose. One day, he ventures into the foreboding Ghost City on a mission from the Heavenly Emperor to locate a missing godly official. There, he encounters the Ghost King, Hua Cheng - a fearsome and mysterious being who rules the ghostly domain. Though dreaded across the realms, Hua Cheng treats Xie Lian with unexpected kindness and familiarity. As they spend more time together, an intriguing bond seems to form between the outcast god and ghost king. Meanwhile in the heavens, the other gods accuse Xie Lian of suspicious relations with spirits and ghosts. His past blunders and bad luck have already made him an amusing laughing stock. To make matters worse, word of an old crime committed by Xie Lian spreads in the celestial courts. With his reputation on the line, will Xie Lian once again become an exile among the divine beings? Or will his budding connection to the Ghost King Hua Cheng prove to be a blessing in disguise - one that gives him purpose amidst adversity?",
