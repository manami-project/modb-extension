    "text": "After Wu Xin's departure, Xiao Se and Lei Wu Jie make their way to Xueyue City. There, the renowned Third Lord Sikong Chang Feng insists on taking Xiao Se as his disciple. Meanwhile, Lei Wu Jie boldly challenges the legendary Dengtian Chamber, seeking an audience with the renowned Xueyue Sword Deity, Second Lord Li Han Yi. He aims to persuade Li Han Yi to visit his master, Lei Hong, leader of the Lei Faction. The two make a dangerous wager - if Lei Wu Jie can withstand three strikes of Li Han Yi's sword, she will accompany him. In the months that follow, Lei Wu Jie rapidly improves his martial arts skills. Ultimately, he endures Li Han Yi's fearsome onslaught, and she keeps her word, departing the mountain with him. As Xiao Se settles in Xueyue City, the other Princes of Tianqi grow restless, conspiring against the city and seeking out allies for an impending conflict. Unbeknownst to the heroes, a scheme brews that soon threatens to engulf them all.",
