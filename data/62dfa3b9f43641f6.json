  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Code Geass: Soubou no Oz is a picture drama that explores the backstory behind the formation of the Glinda Knights, an elite unit within the Britannian Empire. The drama follows two key characters: Orpheus Zevon, a young theorist from the Order of the Black Knights searching for his mistress' killer, and Oldrin Zevon, a member of the Glinda Knights fighting against the Black Knights. Inspired by the classic tale The Wizard of Oz, the drama shows Orpheus and Oldrin on opposite sides of the conflict, providing perspective on both the Britannian and resistance forces. Their intertwining stories offer insight into pivotal events leading up to the conception of the Glinda Knights. Through the lens of this creative reimagining, Code Geass: Soubou no Oz promises to shed light on unexplored corners of the Code Geass universe while entertaining fans with its drama and intrigue.",
