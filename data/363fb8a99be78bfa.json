  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Even a few decades ahead, Earth finds itself in a devastating war against extraterrestrial beings known as Worms, leading to the loss of a third of the human population and a significant number of young men. Desperate for survival, humanity resorted to using weapons of mass destruction, which resulted in the melting of Antarctica and the submersion of much of Earth's land underwater.\n\nNow, as the Worms resurface, hope lies in the hands of three young girls - Otoha, a determined country girl; Karen, a brilliant technician; and Eika, a resolute and strong-willed individual. These three are trained to pilot Sonic Divers, powerful mechas specifically designed to counter the alien threat.\n\nAs the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, these young girls prepare to take on the responsibility of protecting Earth and ensuring the survival of the human race. Will they be able to rise to the challenge and defeat the Worms once and for all?",
