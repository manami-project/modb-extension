  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Azusa Noyama is a 12-year-old 5th grade student who goes by the nickname \"Azuki-chan,\" which she has disliked since being given it in 1st grade. However, when a new student named Yuunosuke Ogasawara transfers into Azusa's class and stands up for her when she's being teased about her nickname, her perspective changes. Yuunosuke mentions that Azuki-chan was such an unusual name that it was the first one he memorized in the class. Touched by his defense and comment, Azusa suddenly feels pride in her nickname, and develops feelings for Yuunosuke. Though he is quite popular, Azusa falls in love with him. The two begin dating, sharing a diary and officially becoming boyfriend and girlfriend. Despite initial disdain for her nickname, through her relationship with Yuunosuke, Azusa comes to appreciate being called Azuki-chan.",
