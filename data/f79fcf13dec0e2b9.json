Sei Iori, a first-year middle school student, is skilled at building GunPla models but lacks fighting experience. When the mysterious Reiji, an adept GunPla Fighter, enters his life, they decide to team up. Combining Sei's unparalleled building talents with Reiji's combat prowess, they resolve to take on the GunPla Battle World Tournament and emerge victorious. Along the way, Sei constructs their signature model - the Build Strike Gundam - to spearhead their championship bid.
