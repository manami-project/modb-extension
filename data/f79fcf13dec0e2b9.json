The enthusiasm for Gunpla has been reignited with the advent of Gunpla Battles, thrilling competitions that bring these models to life in virtual reality combat. Sei Iori, a middle school student and the son of a model shop owner, is a gifted Gunpla builder but lacks experience in the high-stakes battles. When he crosses paths with Reiji, an enigmatic boy with an uncanny knack for Gunpla combat, they form an unstoppable duo. With Sei's custom-built Build Strike Gundam and Reiji's battle prowess, they embark on a journey to conquer the Gunpla Battle world championships.",
