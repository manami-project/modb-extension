  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Allen is a former hero who has been reincarnated in hopes of finally living a peaceful life. However, due to a mistake in measuring his power, he is branded as a failure by his aristocratic family and expelled from their duchy. What seems a curse becomes a blessing for Allen, as he now has the freedom to roam the lands unchecked. That is, until he crosses paths with his former fianc√©e Liz and saves her from a monster using the power he still retains from his past life. Rather than turn him over to his family, Liz hires Allen as her bodyguard for a dangerous quest she must fulfill. Though yearning for simplicity, Allen is fatefully drawn back into the heroic lifestyle he left behind. With Liz at his side, adventures and trials await the banished hero who only wanted to relax in his new lease on life.",
