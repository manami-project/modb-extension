  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the Divine Empire's dominance sweeps across a mystical realm reminiscent of medieval Europe, the island of Erin, home to the Gael tribe, finds itself in the Empire's crosshairs. In a desperate attempt to counter the Empire's power, the tribe seeks to resurrect the demon king Arawn by sacrificing their priestess, Riannon. However, when the ritual goes awry, Arawn emerges not as a fearsome demon, but as an enigmatic grey-haired man. With his true identity hidden, Arawn aligns himself with Riannon, her brother Arthur, and their diverse group of allies, including a skilled swordsman, a nimble hunter, and a lively band of pixies. Together, they embark on a journey to thwart the Empire's tyranny, unveiling the land's dark secrets as they forge ahead.",
