    "text": "Episodes of \"Hand Shakers\" unfold in the futuristic cityscape of Osaka, where select duos, known as Hand Shakers, can manifest powerful weapons called Nimrodes by joining hands. These Nimrodes are physical manifestations of their deepest desires and psyches. In a quest to have their one true wish granted, Hand Shaker pairs engage in fierce battles against one another. The ultimate victors will earn the right to challenge the divine entity known as \"God.\"\n\nTazuna, a high school student with a knack for repairing machines, finds himself drawn into this fantastical world after accepting a repair request from a university lab.
