    "text": "It's a delightful adventure for Hiyori Iki as she embarks on two exciting trips with the eccentric Yato and his companion Yukine. The first excursion takes them to a ski resort, where they encounter a group of gods on a corporate retreat. However, the joy of the vacation is overshadowed by a sinister plot brewing in the background, with Yato as the intended victim. In another episode, Yato's successful job leads to a windfall, and he decides to treat Hiyori and Yukine to a day at Capyper Land. Despite Hiyori's initial agreement, her past experience at the park leaves the enjoyment of the day in question. These captivating tales are part of the limited edition 15th and 16th volumes of the Noragami manga, released on November 17, 2015. The 15th volume features the adaptation of the \"Following A Stereotypical Two Hours\" story from the first volume of the Noragami: Shuuishuu spinoff manga, while the 16th volume showcases the main characters' visit to Capyper Land.",
