    "text": "Yousei Chiitan is an anime that follows the adventures of Chiitan, an eternally young Asian small-clawed otter fairy with no gender. Chiitan wears a turtle named Kame-chan on their head and brings fun and mischief wherever they go. The character of Chiitan is loosely based on a real-life female Asian small-clawed otter in Japan named Chiitan. The real Chiitan became an internet celebrity for the stunts and pranks captured in videos posted on social media. This fame led to Chiitan being named an honorary tourism ambassador for the city of Susaki. However, the controversial and sometimes violent nature of the videos led to backlash. Chiitan's status as a tourism ambassador was not renewed and a planned anime series was canceled after only a promotional video. Yousei Chiitan imagines an alternate life for Chiitan as a magical fairy baby. The anime aims to capture the playful spirit and humor that attracted fans to the original otter, while leaving behind the more problematic elements from the real-life videos. Join Chiitan's new adventures in a whimsical fantasy world!",
