  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kame-chan-wearing, eternally youthful, and genderless, Chiitan, the Asian small-clawed otter fairy, takes center stage in Yousei Chiitan. This whimsical character, inspired by a real-life pet otter, once served as the unofficial mascot of Susaki city in Kochi prefecture, Japan. Chiitan's playful antics and pranks, shared widely on social media, garnered a substantial fan base, leading to its recognition as an honorary tourism ambassador. However, the city government later distanced itself from Chiitan due to the sometimes unsettling and violent nature of the videos. Originally slated for a TV series debut on April 3, 2019, the broadcast was ultimately canceled, with only a 15-second promo video ever released. Join Chiitan on its delightful, mischievous adventures, always donning a peculiar turtle hat, in this captivating anime series.",
