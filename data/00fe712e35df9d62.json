    "text": "Naoya—a young man juggling two girlfriends, Saki and Nagisa—finds his summer vacation heating up when two more admirers enter the scene. First, there's Mirika, who boldly stole a kiss from him, and then there's Shino, harboring a secret crush on him. As they embark on a romantic escapade filled with fireworks, camping, and a trip to Okinawa, the complexities of Naoya's love life only intensify. Adding another layer to this neo-standard love comedy is the arrival of Mirika's younger sister, Risa. With summer in full swing and swimsuits galore, this season promises more laughter, romance, and excitement than ever before!",
