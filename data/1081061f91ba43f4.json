  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Earth Union is engaged in a massive intergalactic war in Space Era 0156, struggling to defend humanity's far-reaching space colonies from foreign threats. The fate of Earth hangs in the balance as the Union secretly builds its new ace battleship, the Tiramisu. At the helm of this crucial warship is Subaru Ichinose, a lonely but ingenious pilot. Though awkward with his crewmates, Subaru finds solace in the cockpit of his personal mecha, Durandal F, which he likens to the comforting enclosure of his mother's womb. As the Tiramisu heads into battle, Subaru must overcome threats both outside and within his ship - from hostile aliens to stray pork skewers invading his beloved cockpit sanctuary. With the entire human race counting on his piloting skills, Subaru launches daring food attacks on his own face to relieve tension. But the Tiramisu still has a long fight ahead to secure humanity's future among the stars. Can this eccentric pilot and his battleship turn the tide of war and lead Earth to victory?",
