  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ron Kamonohashi was once the star student at the prestigious Detective Training Academy BLUE, but a tragic case gone wrong resulted in his expulsion. Now a reclusive private eye, Ron is approached by rookie detective Totomaru Ishiki to help solve a difficult serial murder case. Though eccentric and deranged, Ron's brilliant intuition cracks the case in a day. More cases come their way, but Ron seems cursed - those around him tend to meet tragic fates. Yet the ever-optimistic Totomaru has a knack for saving lives. This mismatched pair joins forces against criminals and corruption despite opposition from Totomaru's department and threats from Ron's mysterious past. Together, they shine light on the truth and take on justice one case at a time. From the creator of \"Reborn!\" comes an offbeat buddy detective story where the stakes are life and death but the bond between opposites leads to exceptional crimesolving.",
