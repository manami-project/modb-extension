    "text": "Koryu, a special vessel, embarks on a critical mission in the year 2086, carrying humanity's last hope against the resurgent threat of the Worms, enigmatic mechanical cell clusters that had previously decimated the Earth. In the aftermath of a devastating two-year war, humanity, united in desperation, had resorted to weapons of mass destruction, causing catastrophic damage to the planet and the loss of 90% of its military personnel, primarily men in their twenties and thirties.\n\nNow, the Worms have re-emerged near Midway, and the world's fate rests in the hands of the Sky Girls, three courageous young pilots commanding the Aviation Exoskeleton Sky Divers: Reijin, Fujin, and Raijin. The Sky Girls - Sakurano Otoha, Sonomiya Karen, and Ichijou Eika - each bring unique skills to the battlefield, combining genius, swordsmanship, and quick thinking in their quest to vanquish the unfathomable enemy.\n\nAs skepticism surrounds the capabilities of the Sonic Diver Unit, the Sky Girls must rise to the challenge and prove their worth in a series of intense battles that will test their courage and determination to the limits. Can they succeed in their mission and save humanity from the brink of extinction? Join the Sky Girls on their thrilling journey and discover the fate of the world in this action-packed anime.",
