  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a series of bombings rocks Tokyo, bumbling police officer Ryotsu finds himself reluctantly paired with Lisa, an FBI agent, and Dandy, her robot assistant, to track down the masked bomber Benten. The bombings exclusively target the gaudy buildings of the Shinatora Corporation, leading Ryotsu and Lisa to believe the bombings are personal. As the attacks escalate, the newly formed team races to stop Benten from detonating a massive Soviet-era rocket equipped with a deadly one-ton bomb under the Shinatora amusement park, which would obliterate the entire Katsushika ward of Tokyo. Despite his incompetence, Ryotsu may be the only one who can crack the case and save the city from catastrophe. This whimsical crime story pairs high stakes action with plenty of oddball laughs.",
