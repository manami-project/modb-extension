    "text": "The anime follows the story of Yuuya, a lackadaisical member of the pop duo ZINGS, who views his idol status as a mere means to an easy life. His lackluster performances and disdain for fans have him teetering on the brink of being fired. However, his life takes an unexpected turn when he encounters Asahi, a spirited ghost of a former idol who yearns to return to the stage. In a bizarre twist, Asahi possesses Yuuya, aiming to reclaim her lost glory through him. Asahi's infectious enthusiasm and Yuuya's newfound success as an idol create a chaotic yet entertaining partnership. But will Yuuya learn to appreciate the spotlight and the fans, or will he continue to yearn for his previous life of leisure? Join this unusual duo as they navigate the ups and downs of the idol world, blending humor, heart, and a touch of the supernatural.",
