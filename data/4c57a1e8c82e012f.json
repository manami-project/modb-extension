  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuuya is an idol singer who is part of the duo ZINGS, but his extreme laziness and apathy towards fans has him on the verge of getting fired. During a chance backstage encounter, he meets the ghost of Asahi, a passionate former idol who died a year ago. Asahi is eager to perform again and realizes she can possess Yuuya's body to make that happen. At first, Yuuya thinks this arrangement allows him to coast along while Asahi essentially does his job for him. However, Asahi has bigger plans - she wants the two of them to become the greatest idol act ever. Her fiery spirit for performing ignites a change in the previously unmotivated Yuuya. Together they work on revamping their stage presence and connecting with fans. But trying to balance a professional partnership with a literal possession presents more than a few challenges. This odd couple will have to overcome their wildly different personalities if they want to achieve Asahi's ambitious goals. Their partnership seems destined for either massive success or utter disaster - either way, hijinks are sure to ensue in this supernatural idol comedy.",
