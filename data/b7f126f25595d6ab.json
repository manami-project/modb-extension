    "text": "As the cherry blossoms herald the end of spring break and the start of a new school term, Kyouya finds himself in an unexpected predicament. Abruptly bundled into a bag, he is transported to a room that mirrors the familiar surroundings of the GJ Club, but with a twist. Instead of the usual Japanese landscape, he's greeted by the bustling cityscape of New York! Joined by his fellow GJ Club members, including the recently graduated Mao, this unforeseen journey promises a graduation trip filled with intrigue and excitement. What adventures await the GJ Club in the heart of New York, and how will they adapt their club activities to this new setting? Only time will tell in this delightful escapade that blends humor, friendship, and a touch of mystery.",
