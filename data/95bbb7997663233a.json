  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now living on a tranquil, remote island following her father's untimely passing, young Momo finds herself in a world far removed from the bustling city she once knew. Surrounded by aged wooden structures, serene fields, and ancient shrines nestled among the trees, Momo struggles to adapt to her new environment. Haunted by her father's unfinished letter bearing just the words 'Dear Momo,' she stumbles upon an old book in her attic, sparking a series of peculiar events that she can't quite explain.\n\nAs Momo grapples with her grief and the mystery surrounding her father's final message, she discovers three mischievous yokai residing in her attic. Invisible to everyone but her, these spirited creatures bring a whirlwind of chaos to the quiet island life. Despite their penchant for mischief, they may hold the key to helping Momo unravel the enigma of her father's letter and find solace in her new home.\n\nWith the support of her newfound friends—both human and yokai—Momo embarks on a heartwarming journey of self-discovery, growth, and healing, as she learns to embrace the beauty of her new life and the secrets it holds.",
