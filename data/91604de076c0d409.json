    "text": "Ibushi Silver Veteran's triumphs on the global stage have reignited a passion for women's cycling in Japan, a sport that had been dormant for decades following its brief post-WWII heyday. Inspired by this resurgence and the exploits of their idols, Tsutsuji Kurume and Remu Tachikawa, five young women forge a connection online, bonding over their shared love of the sport.\n\nWhen they finally meet in person, they make a life-changing decision: to breathe new life into the sport they adore by training together to become professional cyclists. This decision leads Izumi Itou, one of the aspiring athletes, to a fateful encounter with Nana Hiratsuka, a prodigious talent who will become both her closest friend and fiercest rival.\n\nTogether, they embark on a grueling journey filled with sweat, tears, and perseverance, aiming to claim the coveted title of 'Girls' Fresh Queens' - the pinnacle of Keirin racing. As they navigate the harsh realities of this unforgiving world, their unwavering dedication to each other and their dreams propels them towards greatness.",
