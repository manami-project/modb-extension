    "text": "Ever since Rikka was rescued by Gridman, an interdimensional super agent, her life has changed dramatically. Not only does she possess immense powers, but she also shares a mysterious connection with a terrible monster. Despite the looming threats, high school student Yuta decides to confess his feelings to Rikka, drawn to her kind heart. Soon after, new enemies emerge, threatening the safety of the city once again. Called to action, Yuta bonds with Gridman to defeat the invading kaiju. Though Yuta has no memory of previously uniting with Gridman, he seizes the opportunity to step up as a hero and protect all that he holds dear. With Rikka and friends by his side, Yuta faces the battles ahead with courage and determination. This continuation of SSSS.GRIDMAN promises thrilling kaiju showdowns underscored by themes of friendship, bravery, and the quiet strength of the human spirit. As the next chapter unfolds, both new and familiar threats will test the resolve of our heroes. Yet some bonds transcend even lost memories, lighting the way forward.",
