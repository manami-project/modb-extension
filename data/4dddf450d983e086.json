The world is tranquil, with no recollection of the kaiju, Gridman, or Akane Shinjou among its inhabitants, barring Rikka and Utsumi. Surprisingly, even Yuuta, who once served as Gridman's vessel, remains oblivious to the pivotal moments of his past. However, when a new kaiju emerges, Yuuta sees an opportunity to reaffirm his heroism and reunites with Gridman once more. Meanwhile, Rikka, who was once saved by Gridman, a super agent from another realm, finds herself bestowed with extraordinary powers and a clandestine link to a monstrous entity. Despite this, Yuta, a high school student, is drawn to Rikka and decides to reveal his feelings for her. As new threats loom, another battle is set to commence.",
