    "text": "Nicoletta travels to Rome as a young woman seeking her mother, Olga, who abandoned her 15 years prior. She discovers Olga has remarried and now works at a popular local restaurant called Casetta dell'Orso. When Nicoletta arrives at the restaurant intent on confronting her mother, she finds herself enchanted by the warm and welcoming staff of older bespectacled gentlemen. She agrees to keep secret her connection to Olga and ends up staying in Rome to train as a chef at the restaurant. As Nicoletta adjusts to her new life and tries her hand at cooking, she forms a close bond with one of the waiters, Claudio, despite their age difference. Though she came to Rome seeking vengeance, Nicoletta discovers new beginnings full of promise.",
