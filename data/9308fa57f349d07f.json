    "text": "It's been 15 years since Olga left her daughter, Nicoletta, and eloped to Rome. Now, with vengeance in her heart, Nicoletta embarks on a journey to Rome to disrupt her mother's life. Her search leads her to Casetta dell'Orso, a quaint and popular restaurant nestled in a small street near the city center. This unique eatery is staffed entirely by older, bespectacled men who exude warmth and wisdom. As Nicoletta steps inside, her plans of retribution begin to waver, captivated by the enchanting atmosphere and the gentle smiles of the staff.\n\nNicoletta's initial intention was to reveal her mother's hidden past to her new husband, the owner of Casetta dell'Orso. However, she finds herself increasingly drawn to the restaurant and one of its waiters, Claudio. Despite the age difference, Nicoletta's feelings for Claudio deepen, leading her to promise to keep her mother's secret and take up an apprenticeship at the restaurant as an aspiring chef. As she navigates the culinary world, Nicoletta struggles to bridge the age gap and win the affection of the reserved Claudio. Will her love for him overcome the odds, or will her past continue to cast a shadow over her newfound life in Rome?",
