  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ii Naomasa receives a fatal wound from Shimazu Toyohisa during the Battle of Sekigahara, but Toyohisa is also critically injured. As he staggers away from the battlefield, Toyohisa is mysteriously transported to a corridor filled with doors. He encounters a bespectacled man named Murasaki, who sends him through a door leading to an alternate world. In this new realm, Toyohisa joins forces with other legendary warriors, collectively known as 'Drifters,' who have been summoned from various time periods.\n\nTogether with renowned historical figures such as Nobunaga Oda and Yoichi Nasu, Toyohisa must navigate a world filled with magical creatures, including elves and dwarves. However, they face a formidable challenge: a rival group of warriors called the 'Ends' seeks to conquer the world and annihilate the Drifters. As the Ends' army, commanded by the ruthless Black King and reinforced by fearsome creatures like dragons, advances on the continent, the Octobrist Organization, a group of native human magicians, strives to unite the Drifters in a desperate attempt to save their world from destruction.\n\nIn this alternate universe, Toyohisa and his fellow Japanese samurai may be the last hope against the encroaching darkness, as they find themselves embroiled in a new global conflict that will test their skills and determination to the limits.",
