    "text": "Unyan is an eager young kitten from Cat Island who is thrilled to take on his first job making a special delivery. However, he quickly gets distracted along the way by fun diversions - flying soap bubbles capture his attention and he can't resist snacking on some tasty candy gifted to him. Caught up in the wonder and excitement around him, Unyan accidentally loses his important delivery bag! Once he realizes his mistake, the determined kitten sets off on an epic chase to retrieve the lost bag. We follow along on Unyan's heartwarming and humorous quest as he learns about responsibility, overcoming challenges, and the kindness of helpful strangers along the way. Ultimately, this is a story about the endearing interactions between an adorable yet scatterbrained little kitten and the patient adults who watch over his journey with guidance and support when he needs it most.",
