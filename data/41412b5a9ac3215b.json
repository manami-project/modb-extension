    "text": "Bundled with the 11th volume of the novel series, this new anime short series introduces the Pleiades combat maids and the rest of the Floor Guardians in a chibi art style. After the events of \"Overlord: Ple Ple Pleiades,\" Lord Ainz has successfully modified and disarmed a troublesome magic item, but accidentally activates it before safely storing it away. The Pleiadians and the Guardians of the Plains give in to their emotions, causing chaos as some search for an antidote and Lord Ainz attempts to maintain control. Despite their efforts, collateral damage is inevitable. (Source: Anime News Network)",
