    "text": "They'll strip or be stripped of their chance to return home! After Junpei's failed attempts to transport back to Japan, our unlikely heroes - Junpei, the martial arts expert, Airi, the Hollywood superstar, and Ritsuko, the machine gun-toting tomboy - must embark on a quest to collect spell fragments. These fragments, however, are no ordinary pieces; they're tattooed on the bodies of unsuspecting female elves. With the help of their shape-shifting companion, Celcia, who's been cursed into the form of a different animal, the trio must navigate through a world filled with everything from Satan Santa to legendary pillows that make dreams come true. The stakes are high, as their failure to find the fragments could lead to the destruction of both their world and the world of the elves. Join the trio in this wild and hilarious journey as they hunt elves and strip their way back home!",
