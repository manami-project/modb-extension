    "text": "Niwa's life takes a dramatic turn on his 14th birthday when his confession of love to his long-time crush, Risa, is rejected. As if that wasn't enough, he discovers his family's secret legacy - he transforms into the notorious phantom thief, Dark Mousy, whenever he thinks about Risa. His mother, aware of this heritage, coerces him into stealing valuable artworks for reasons unknown to him. As Niwa grapples with his new identity and struggles to maintain his relationships, he learns that he's not alone in this predicament. His classmate, Hiwatari Satoshi, seems to share a similar fate. Will Niwa be able to navigate through his adolescence while balancing his unwanted thieving persona? Only time will tell.",
