  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On his 14th birthday, average teenager Daisuke Niwa attempts to declare his love to his longtime crush Risa Harada, but is rejected. That night, Daisuke transforms into the phantom thief Dark Mousy whenever thoughts of Risa cross his mind. Daisuke's mother Emiko reveals that the male heirs in their family inherit the alter ego of Dark upon turning 14. She makes Daisuke transform into Dark to steal valuable artwork, though her reasons are initially unclear. As Daisuke struggles balancing his normal life, his emerging feelings for Risa, and his thieving at night as Dark, he learns that classmate Satoshi Hiwatari shares the same type of inherited alter ego transformation ability. Though details remain scarce, it becomes evident that Daisuke and Satoshi's families have a mysterious shared history tied to their phantom thief legacies. Moving forward, Daisuke faces inner turmoil as he tries to understand the secrets of his family's past and determine the purpose behind his predetermined role as Dark.",
