  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Von Flügel, a high-ranking robot royalty, and her faithful cyclops-arachnid servant, Gedächtnis, reside in the grand Tempest Tower, far into the 49th millennium. Amidst a raging war between humans and machines, the eccentric duo remains unbothered, engaging in light-hearted conversations and nonsensical activities. Joined by Schadenfreude, a monkey-robot, the trio explores the complexities of human life, from letter writing to verbal communication, in a delightfully clueless manner, providing a humorous and engaging escape from the ongoing conflict.",
