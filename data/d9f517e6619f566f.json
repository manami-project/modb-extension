  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Toudai entrance exams have arrived yet again for Keitaro. Brimming with confidence, he sits down to take the test, but ends up falling asleep and dreaming about Narusegawa instead. Waking up with barely any time left, Keitaro assumes he has failed and tries escaping Hinata Inn to forget the memories made there. By chance, he runs into Seta, but ends up stranded on a remote island with the whole Hinata crew searching for him.",
