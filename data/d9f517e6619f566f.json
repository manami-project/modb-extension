    "text": "The moment of reckoning arrives as Keitaro faces the Tokyo University entrance exams, yet again. Brimming with confidence, he begins the test, only to find himself lost in a daydream about Narusegawa. With mere minutes left, he fears the worst and, in a desperate attempt to escape his impending failure and the memories tied to Hinata Inn, he flees. Serendipitously, he crosses paths with Seta, only to find himself stranded on a distant island, with the entire cast in hot pursuit. Back home, Narusegawa and Shinobu refuse to accept Keitaro's disappearance and embark on a mission to find him. As the search unfolds, Keitaro encounters Nyomi, a local island girl with dreams of discovering the mythical Paralantis. With adventure beckoning, can Keitaro be persuaded to return to Japan and face his responsibilities?",
