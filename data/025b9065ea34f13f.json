    "text": "The wrestling world is left in shock as a menacing figure, Space Mask, emerges, unbound by any federation, and unleashes a vicious attack on Shoji. Amidst the chaos, a hero thought to be lost re-emerges: Tiger Mask, driven by the injustice, swoops in to save the day. The legend of Tiger Mask had seemingly ended with the tragic death of Naoto, the previous wearer of the mask, who sacrificed himself to save a child. However, the spirit of Tiger Mask lives on in Tatsuo Aku, an orphan and devoted fan of Naoto.\n\nAku's journey to becoming Tiger Mask II is fraught with trials and tribulations. He dedicates himself to mastering various martial arts and even becomes a journalist. But when a fight turns fatal, resulting in the death of a dear friend, Aku's life takes a drastic turn. Consumed by vengeance, he takes matters into his own hands, only to be arrested for his actions. His fate takes an unexpected twist when he is rescued by a man from the new Tiger's Cave, who convinces him to join their cause.\n\nAfter rigorous training, Aku embarks on a global journey, learning new martial arts techniques and eventually assuming the mantle of Tiger Mask II. With his newfound power, he vows to stand against the illegal activities of the organization, setting the stage for high-stakes battles and thrilling encounters in the wrestling ring.",
