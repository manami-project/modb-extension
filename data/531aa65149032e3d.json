  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mulnite Empire's newest commander is none other than Terakomari Gandesblood, or Komari, a shut-in vampire who has spent the last three years confined to her room. Despite her prestigious lineage, Komari's aversion to blood has left her physically frail, unskilled in magic, and far from the powerful vampire her ancestors were. As she takes charge of the empire's notorious 7th unit, a motley crew of rogues and criminals known for their insubordination, Komari faces an uphill battle. With the threat of mutiny looming over her, Komari must rely on her loyal maid, Vill, to navigate her new role. Can this reclusive vampire rise to the challenge and lead her unruly troops to victory, or will her secret weakness be her downfall? Join Komari in her unlikely journey as she attempts to blunder her way to success while keeping her true identity hidden.",
