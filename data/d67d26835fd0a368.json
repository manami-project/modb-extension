    "text": "Miina Miyafuji and Karen Onodera, two girls with the same eye color as Maiku Kamishiro, enter his life unexpectedly, each claiming to be his long-lost twin sister. Maiku, who grew up in orphanages with only a childhood photograph as a memento, recognizes his former home in a TV report and sets out to uncover his past. He settles into the house from the picture, working as a programmer, until the day these two girls turn his world upside down. Both Miina and Karen possess a copy of the same photograph, showing Maiku and an unidentified girl playing in a children's pool. As they all live together under one roof, Maiku must navigate this newfound complexity to determine who his true twin sister is and who might become his romantic interest.",
