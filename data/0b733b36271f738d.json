    "text": "Kazuyo Hata is a 22-year-old newcomer to the TV news industry. After leaving university, she achieves her dream of becoming a TV newscaster. However, Kazuyo soon discovers that life at the top is filled with challenges. She struggles to navigate office romances and professional rivalries, all while trying to establish herself and get on the good side of the company boss. Despite the difficulties, Kazuyo remains determined and keeps her sweet, goofy disposition. Her journey in the high-pressure industry tests both her journalistic skills and her moral purity. Though conflicted at times between her good heart and bodily desires, Kazuyo perseveres in pursuit of her reporting ambitions. Based on the manga series \"Young Action\" by Michio Yanagisawa, this anime follows an earnest young woman striving to find both career success and personal fulfillment in the competitive world of TV news. Kazuyo's charming naivete collides with the unsavory realities of the media in an entertaining fish-out-of-water tale.",
