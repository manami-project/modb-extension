    "text": "What a vibrant universe we dive into, where idol stardom is the ultimate dream! Meet Mimu Emilton, a spirited 14-year-old brimming with ambition to become an idol, inspired by her role model and Earth's President, Yuri. The annual Starland Festival, a grand celebration on a unified Earth, is Mimu's chance to shine. However, her audition attempts are persistently foiled by a series of comedic misadventures, often leaving her in embarrassing situations.\n\nDespite these setbacks, Mimu's luck turns when she befriends the current Excellent Idols, handpicked successors of Yuri. Just as Mimu's audition begins, an alien abduction sweeps her and the Excellent Idols into an interdimensional escapade. This new world's salvation hinges on unconventional contests, from swimsuit competitions to mud wrestling, all underscored by idol singing!\n\nAs Mimu navigates this wild, intergalactic idol competition, she finds herself in a unique position to save not just this new world, but also her own. The question remains: Can Mimu harness her self-belief and rise to the challenge, becoming the idol she's always aspired to be? Only time will tell in this thrilling, ecchi-filled adventure!",
