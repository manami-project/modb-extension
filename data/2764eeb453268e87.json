  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Sorceresses Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent arrive in a quiet town, hoping to enjoy a peaceful lunch. However, they soon notice the townspeople fleeing indoors as an army of dragons led by a young girl in armor approaches. Lina prepares to defend the town, but the ruler reveals that the invading girl is actually his daughter Marlene. She is demanding an increase in her allowance and attacking the town with her dragon forces in defiance. While Lina agrees to help the ruler with this predicament, Naga sees an opportunity for profit and joins forces with Marlene instead. What follows is a raucous confrontation filled with magical mayhem and rampaging dragons. Lina and the ruler face off against Marlene and Naga in an explosive feud over allowances. Though the conflict may seem trivial, the destructive potential of the parties involved makes it a serious threat to the town. Only Lina's spellcasting mastery can resolve this ultimate showdown between unruly youth and fed-up father.",
