    "text": "While savoring a meal in an unnamed village, the renowned sorceresses Lina Inverse and Naga the Serpent find themselves in the midst of a peculiar conflict. The tranquility of the village is shattered by the arrival of two armies: one human and the other a formidable force of dragons led by a young, armored girl named Marlene. As the skirmish unfolds, Lina learns that Marlene is the rebellious daughter of the village's ruler, and their battles are rooted in a domestic dispute over Marlene's allowance. Lina aligns herself with the ruler, while Naga seizes the opportunity to join Marlene's cause, adding a twist to this magical family feud. As Lina and Naga face off on opposite sides, a more ominous threat to the village may be lurking in the shadows.",
