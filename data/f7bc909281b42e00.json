    "text": "The synopses describe an animated music video for the Japanese song \"Kitakaze Kozou no Kantarou\" that was featured on the NHK television program Minna no Uta. The original 1974 version was performed by singer Maasaki Sakai and the NHK Tokyo Children's Choir. In 1981, a new version was made using the same animated footage but with a different musical arrangement and performers - singer Saburou Kitajima and the Hibari Children Chorus. Over the years, this beloved song and its imaginative video have been enjoyed by Japanese television audiences. With its two distinct renditions, it serves as a unique example of how the same animation can come alive in different ways through the power of music.",
