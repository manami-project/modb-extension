    "text": "Kanako Miyamae has enrolled at Ame no Kisaki, an all-girls academy, with the hope of finally finding her one true love. However, her quest for romance faces several absurd obstacles. Her roommate, the beautiful Mariya Shidou, is actually a mischievous cross-dressing boy who delights in tormenting Kanako. His sharp-tongued maid Matsurika also adds to Kanako's misery. In her second year at the school, Kanako continues searching for love, though dorms filled with traps, distracting snacks, and questionable legal trials make focusing difficult. Mariya remains dedicated to interfering with Kanako's efforts through relentless teasing. Despite the bizarre distractions and Mariyaâ€™s tricks, the ever-optimistic Kanako persists in believing she'll find the girl of her dreams at Ame no Kisaki. However, with secret rooms distorting the laws of time and space, achieving her fairy tale ending seems unlikely. Nonetheless, Kanako holds out hope that fate will guide her to true love.",
