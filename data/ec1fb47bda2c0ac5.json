  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The new anime project centers around a group of heroes called the \"108 Stars\", loosely based on the characters from the classic Chinese novel Water Margin. It is an original story created by veteran anime scriptwriter Yu Yamamoto, known for Mobile Suit Gundam. This project is related to Yamamoto's previous early 80's J9 anime trilogy - Ginga Senpuu Braiger, Ginga Reppuu Baxingar, and Ginga Shippuu Sasuraiger. However, Ginga Jinpū Jinraiger features an entirely new set of characters and narrative. One of the goals behind this anime is to revive 'original anime' in an era dominated by manga adaptations. For this purpose, Yamamoto has set up a 'Practice Anime School' to mentor new writing talent that will carry the anime industry forward. The production of Ginga Jinpū Jinraiger itself serves as practical training for these emerging scriptwriters. With its grand storyline based on a literary classic and Yamamoto's distinctive style, Ginga Jinpū Jinraiger promises to be an exciting mecha anime rich with the spirit of old-school anime. It remains to be seen if it succeeds in its mission to keep original anime alive.",
