  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ginga Jinpuu Jinraiger, an original anime project spearheaded by Yu Yamamoto, is set to revive the spirit of the J9 anime trilogy that captivated audiences in the early 1980s. The trilogy, which included Ginga Senpuu Braiger, Ginga Reppuu Baxingar, and Ginga Shippuu Sasuraiger, was renowned for its unique motifs, ranging from the Hissatsu Series to the Shinsengumi and Around the World in 80 Days.\n\nIn a bid to rekindle the magic of the J9 series, Yamamoto, a seasoned scriptwriter known for his work on Mobile Suit Gundam, has announced that the new series will retain the classic 'J9 taste' while introducing a fresh cast of characters and an original storyline. The new series will draw inspiration from the Chinese classic novel, Water Margin, adding a unique twist to the J9 legacy.\n\nIn an era where anime adaptations of manga are prevalent, Yamamoto aims to resuscitate the 'original anime' through this project. To foster the next generation of anime scriptwriters, he has initiated a 'Practice Anime School,' using Ginga Jinpuu Jinraiger as a teaching tool. This ambitious project promises not only to entertain but also to contribute to the future of anime scriptwriting.",
