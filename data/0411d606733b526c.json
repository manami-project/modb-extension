  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The lighthearted shorts offer a whimsical spin on the post-apocalyptic world of Girls' Last Tour. Chito and Yuuri, the two main characters, are depicted in super-deformed style as they attend fanciful classes in a classroom setting. Though civilization has collapsed, the shorts playfully envision what school life could have been like before the fall. As the girls go about their school day, the shorts provide comedic snapshots into curriculum topics that range from the practical to the absurd. However, the classroom setting also allows the charactersâ€™ endearing dynamic to shine through, revealing small insights into their personalities and relationship. By transplanting the characters into an unlikely yet familiar environment, the shorts strike an imaginative balance between comedy and poignant nostalgia. Fans can enjoy the characters they know and love, while also gaining a fuller appreciation of the human experiences lost amidst the ruins.",
