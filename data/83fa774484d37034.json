  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the director's personal journey to connect with her deceased great-grandmother. Having only known her relative as a portrait on the wall, the director aims to substantiate her great-grandmother's life by photographing and developing pictures of her at different ages. Through this experimental process, she strives to foster a deeper inner relationship with her ancestral heritage. As the director develops the antique photos, glimpses of her great-grandmother's life emerge from the chemical baths. The vague portraits and imaginings kindle more questions than answers about the mysteries of this woman's history. We witness the director's frustrations and insights as she tries to uncover the essence of a person she can never truly know. Ultimately, this anime is a poetic meditation on family, memory, and our attempts to commune with those no longer living. The director's journey speaks to our profound desire for ancestral connection - to know where we came from by reaching back through the generations. By wrestling with photos and spirits, she unearths not facts but rather a new way relating to her own origins.",
