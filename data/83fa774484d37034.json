  "synopsis": {
    "text": "My great-grandmother had always been a distant figure, her presence confined to a portrait hanging on the wall. In an attempt to forge a deeper connection with her, I embarked on a personal journey, directing a film under the helm of Sachiyo Kurosawa. My mission was to bring her to life by photographing and developing images of her at two distinct ages, transforming her static portrait into a tangible memory. This heartwarming anime explores the lengths we go to understand and connect with those who have passed before us.",
