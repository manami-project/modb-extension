    "text": "People often find solace and companionship in the most unusual places, and for Shun, it was his guitar that brought him joy since childhood. As a guitarist immersed in the electrifying world of rock & roll, Shun finds himself at a crossroads in life. His corporate job is about to transfer him to Shanghai, which seems like a promising opportunity for his girlfriend Kaori, but leaves Shun questioning his dreams and aspirations.\n\nIn the midst of this internal struggle, fate introduces him to Kyoko, a former idol who disappeared from the limelight due to her disdain for the industry. As they both grapple with the question of self-expression through music, Kyoko's words of encouragement strike a chord within Shun, urging him to reconsider his path.\n\nAs Shun contemplates the choice between a conventional, happy life with Kaori and an uncertain future in music, the story unfolds, revealing the complexities of relationships and the importance of staying true to oneself. The narrative reaches a climax as Shun and Kyoko confront their shared desire to express themselves, even if it means hurting those around them. In this quest for self-expression, they find themselves pondering a new 'What if...?' that could change their lives forever.",
