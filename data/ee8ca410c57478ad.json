  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese tradition meets whimsical animation in this captivating short film, which masterfully intertwines live-action and paper cutout animation for a unique viewing experience. The story unfolds as a petite man perched on a desk boldly declares to a young woman donning a classic Japanese hairstyle that women originated from tobacco. In response to his peculiar claim, the amused girl playfully ensnares him beneath a glass.\n\nInfuriated, the man retaliates by puffing on a pipe cigarette and exhaling smoke towards the girl. Undeterred, she seizes the cigarette and tucks it safely beneath her book. The man, escalating the confrontation, brandishes a firearm, only for the girl to swiftly discard the cigarette into the yard. Livid, the man attempts to shoot her, but the gun misfires. Ultimately, the man resigns to recounting the origins of tobacco to the girl.\n\nAs the oldest surviving work by Noburou Oofuji, this film showcases his innovative blending of animation techniques and live-action footage, resulting in a visually engaging and entertaining experience for viewers.",
