  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Almost everyone in contemporary society feels like they are being pushed and pulled by outside forces, as if they are game pieces in Sugoroku, a traditional board game. For most, it is their parents who first set them on this predetermined path. We follow a young boy as he grows up, dependent on his parents to make decisions for him. His family members each play a role in this game of \"life Sugoroku\"- his father rolls the dice and his mother moves him accordingly. He goes where he is told, living passively. But as the boy gets older, he begins to question how long he will allow his family to dictate his moves. Will he make the difficult decision to break away from this family \"game\" and take control of his own life's direction? This poignant anime explores the tension between conforming to expectations versus forging one's own path.",
