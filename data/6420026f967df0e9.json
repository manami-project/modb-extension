  "synopsis": {
    "text": "We all, in today's society, are moved and guided by someone or something, much like pieces in a Sugoroku game. The first guiding figures are usually our 'Parents'. This anime follows the journey of a young boy navigating through life's Sugoroku board, heavily relying on his parents for direction. His family embodies the roles of a Sugoroku game, with his father casting the dice and his mother propelling him forward as he passively treads his path. But how long can this family dynamic, mirroring a Sugoroku game, persist? The boy eventually decides to sever ties with his family, marking a significant turning point in his life. This compelling narrative is the graduate work of Tanaka Miki from Tokyo University of the Arts, Graduate School of Film and New Media, Department of Animation.",
