    "text": "Kuroki Tomoko is a 15-year-old high school student eager to reinvent herself and become popular. However, Tomoko suffers from extreme social anxiety that makes normal interactions incredibly difficult. Though she has experience navigating virtual social situations and dating simulators, Tomoko struggles to transfer those skills to real life. As Tomoko enters high school, she remains isolated and unable to make friends. Her expectations of instantly becoming a popular student crash quickly. Tomoko realizes she must overcome her anxiety and make genuine connections if she wants to have the high school experience she dreamed of. With some help from her one friend Yuu and the support of her brother Tomoki, Tomoko slowly begins facing her fears. Watashi ga Motenai no wa Dou Kangaetemo Omaera ga Warui! follows Tomoko Kurokiâ€™s humorous yet painfully awkward journey to push past her introverted nature and blossom into the social butterfly she always imagined herself to be.",
