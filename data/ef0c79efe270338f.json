    "text": "Though Kimihiko Kimizuka, a high school student, has always been a magnet for trouble, his life takes a dramatic turn when he becomes the assistant to the enigmatic and beautiful detective, Siesta. Together, they embark on thrilling, globe-trotting adventures, thwarting hijackings, and combating a secret organization. However, their partnership comes to a tragic end with Siesta's untimely death.\n\nIn an attempt to return to normalcy, Kimihiko resumes his mundane life as a student, but fate has other plans. He encounters a girl who bears a striking resemblance to Siesta, and a new case lands in his lap, threatening to disrupt his newly regained routine. This case not only stirs up old memories but also hints at a connection to his deceased partner and a global conspiracy. As Kimihiko delves deeper, he realizes that Siesta's legacy may not be as buried as he thought, and he might just be the one to uncover it.",
