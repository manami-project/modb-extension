    "text": "Toramizu Ginta is a young boy who dreams every night of a magical fantasy world called MAR Heaven, but his classmates tease him for his dreams. One day, a portal suddenly transports Ginta to the very world he has dreamed about - a land where magical weapons called Ã„RMS exist. Though initially enthralled, Ginta soon realizes MAR Heaven is also a harsh land torn by war. He joins a resistance effort led by the mysterious hero Babbo to liberate the kingdom from an evil queen. Alongside allies Jack, Snow, and Alan, Ginta discovers his own latent powers and fights to save this magical realm that was once only a dream. Though thrust into the midst of conflict, Ginta remains resolute in making his childhood fantasy a new reality.",
