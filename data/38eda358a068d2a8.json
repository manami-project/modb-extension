    "text": "For 15-year-old Marion, a French boarding school student, life is all about reason and rationality. He is admired by his peers for his intelligence and good looks, but he harbors a deep disdain for emotions, viewing them as unnecessary and even trivial. However, when he meets a captivating older woman named Sara, his beliefs about love and relationships are put to the test. As they embark on a secret affair, Marion's icy exterior begins to melt, and he discovers the power of love. But as he navigates the ups and downs of his newfound emotions, he must also confront the consequences of his actions and learn the true cost of his affair. Will Marion be able to reconcile his rationalist beliefs with his newfound emotions, or will the price of love be too high to bear? Only time will tell in this gripping tale of love, growth, and self-discovery.",
