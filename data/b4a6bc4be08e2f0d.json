As a skilled gun expert known as a Senshi, Rushuna's radiant smile and unmatched marksmanship are her ultimate tools to bring peace to the land. Despite her preference for non-violence, Rushuna is often compelled to demonstrate her extraordinary shooting abilities in the heat of battle.\n\nCrossing paths with Kojima Yajirou, a steadfast samurai turned mercenary, the two form an unlikely alliance. Yajirou, a master swordsman, finds himself time and again saved by Rushuna's high-caliber revolver and captivating charm. Together, they traverse the war-torn country, facing countless adversaries and leaving a trail of disarmed foes in their wake.\n\nThough guns have become the weapon of choice for many, Rushuna remains loyal to her seemingly outdated revolver.

United by their shared goal of restoring peace, Rushuna and Yajirou embark on a series of action-packed adventures, challenging enemies with both blade and bullet.
