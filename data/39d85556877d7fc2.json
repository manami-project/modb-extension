  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Little Kitaro, a benevolent Yokai, resides in the enchanted GeGeGe forest with his father, Medama-Oyaji, and a host of supernatural companions. Kitaro's unwavering faith in the peaceful coexistence of humans and Yokai stems from a past rescue by a human. However, not all Yokai share Kitaro's optimistic outlook. As civilization encroaches on nature, some Yokai grow increasingly resentful of humanity's selfish actions, leading to a conflict within the Yokai community. With the help of his allies, Kitaro navigates this conflict, defending his belief in love and coexistence while simultaneously protecting humans from malevolent Yokai who seek to punish humanity for their disregard towards nature. All the while, the mischievous Rat-man never misses an opportunity to stir up trouble, adding an unexpected twist to Kitaro's noble quest.",
