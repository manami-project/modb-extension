  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Soon to be known as Ivy, Femicia is born into a world where magical abilities are determined by stars, and those without are considered ill-fated. On her fifth birthday, she discovers her single skill is monster taming, but with zero stars, she's deemed a harbinger of misfortune. Shunned by her family and village, Ivy is forced to live in isolation in the forest.\n\nIn this lonely existence, Ivy befriends Sora, a seemingly ordinary slime with a fondness for blue potions. Despite her low abilities, Ivy successfully tames Sora, and together, they embark on a journey to survive and overcome their shared status as outcasts. As they travel from town to town, collecting discarded items and selling what they can, Ivy and Sora form a bond that transcends their circumstances.\n\nWith memories of a past life and a goal given by a fortune teller to reach the royal capital, Ivy and Sora may hold the key to solving the country's growing waste problem. In a world that values stars, Ivy and Sora's unlikely friendship and hidden talents may prove that there's more to a person than their magical abilities. Join Ivy and Sora on their heartwarming adventure as they challenge societal norms and discover their true worth.",
