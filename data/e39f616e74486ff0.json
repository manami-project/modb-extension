    "text": "Se-Heyon Choi is a professional climber who has dedicated her life to the sport. On the eve of the Climbing World Championships, her dreams are threatened when she discovers she is pregnant. Struggling with this revelation, Se-Heyon begins having vivid dreams and receiving strange text messages from an alternate version of herself - one who was injured in a car accident and is now pregnant and wheelchair-bound. As the messages continue, the lines between Se-Heyon's reality and her mysterious alternate life blur. She grapples with conflicting feelings over her pregnancy and career ambitions. On one hand, she strives to regain control and break free to follow her competitive climbing aspirations. On the other, the messages impart wisdom about embracing motherhood over athletic pursuits. Caught between two futures, Se-Heyon searches to determine what is real. She must confront difficult questions about her identity, purpose and what it truly means to have it all.",
