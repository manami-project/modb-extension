    "text": "Angeliono, a typical resident of the dilapidated Dark Meat City, shares a rundown apartment with his eccentric friend, Vinz. After a minor accident while delivering pizzas, Angeliono's mundane life takes a bizarre turn as he begins to suffer from persistent headaches and unsettling hallucinations. The accident, caused by a captivating woman named Luna, also triggers the emergence of extraordinary powers within him. As he grapples with these new abilities, he finds himself inexplicably pursued by Men in Black and the police SWAT team, leading to the destruction of his home. Unbeknownst to Angeliono, he is half-human, half-Macho - an alien race with sinister plans for global domination. Inspired by 1950s science fiction, hip hop music, and wrestling, this gripping anime unfolds the mysterious origins of Angeliono and the enigmatic happenings in Dark Meat City.",
