    "text": "Tatsunoko Productions' 55th anniversary brings us a captivating 3DCG anime with a unique twist on the original manga's storyline. Our protagonist, Emi Kaido, is a disillusioned 17-year-old living in Shibuya, estranged from her workaholic father for a decade. Emi's life takes an unexpected turn when she stumbles upon a magical pencil capable of granting wishes.\n\nWhile caught in the midst of a convenience store robbery, Emi's life hangs in the balance. In her desperation, she wishes for a hero to save the day. To her astonishment, not one, but four heroes from alternate realities emerge to answer her plea. United by the common enemy \"Z,\" who annihilated their worlds, they join forces with Emi to prevent further destruction.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Emi's once-dull life becomes a thrilling adventure filled with mystery and intrigue. Will these heroes be the key to the excitement she's been longing for, or do they bring with them an even greater challenge? Join Emi and her extraordinary companions as they strive to alter the course of destiny in this riveting anime.",
