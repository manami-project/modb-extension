    "text": "It's a tale of passion, friendship, and baseball in the high school arena. Hiro Kunimi, a prodigious pitcher and batter, is compelled to abandon his dreams of professional baseball due to an elbow injury. To distance himself from the sport, he enrolls in a high school devoid of a baseball team. Despite his efforts, baseball continues to haunt him as he encounters Haruka, the bumbling manager of an unofficial baseball club at his new school. Initially joining the soccer team, Hiro finds himself caught in a rivalry between the two clubs. When the soccer team attempts to humiliate the baseball club, Hiro's love for baseball reignites, leading him to switch teams mid-game. Alongside Haruka and his childhood friend, Hiro embarks on a mission to reestablish the school's baseball team and rekindle his dream of competing in the national championship. Will Hiro's injury stand in the way, or will his determination lead the team to victory?",
