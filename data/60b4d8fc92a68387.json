    "text": "Cape Fox serves as the backdrop for an unusual tale, where two girls, each grappling with their own challenges, find solace in a mysterious abode known as Mayoiga. After a devastating earthquake and tsunami, 17-year-old Yui, fleeing from her turbulent past, and 8-year-old Hiyori, rendered mute and orphaned by the catastrophe, cross paths at the Kitsunezaki gym.\n\nEnter Kiwa, an enigmatic elderly woman who, claiming to be their grandmother, extends an invitation to stay at Mayoiga, a legendary house rumored to shelter lost souls. This quaint, slightly worn-down dwelling, perched atop a cliff overlooking the ocean, exudes an aura of nostalgia and warmth, providing the girls with the comfort they desperately seek.\n\nAs they settle into their new life, Yui and Hiyori begin to heal, their hearts mending under Kiwa's nurturing care. However, the tranquility of Mayoiga is soon disrupted by the arrival of peculiar beings, referred to by Kiwa as \"Fushigitto.\" Despite these strange occurrences, the girls, bound by their shared experiences and the hope for a brighter future, continue their journey towards healing and self-discovery in this house that holds more secrets than it initially seems.",
