  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Itâ€™s all smiles and admiration for the picture-perfect couple, Hanabi Yasuraoka and Mugi Awaya, as they navigate their high school days. But beneath the surface of their seemingly idyllic relationship lies a shared secret and mutual understanding that only they know. Both Hanabi and Mugi are nursing unrequited love for individuals they cannot be with.\n\nHanabi's heart has always belonged to her childhood friend and neighbor, Narumi Kanai. Her joy knows no bounds when he becomes her new homeroom teacher, only to be replaced by despair as she watches him fall for the charming music teacher, Akane Minagawa. Mugi, on the other hand, has been enamored with Akane ever since she tutored him in middle school.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Hanabi and Mugi cross paths and, recognizing the same longing in each other's eyes, decide to form a makeshift alliance. They become surrogates for one another, seeking solace and physical intimacy in their shared loneliness, all while clinging to the hope of one day reuniting with their true loves. As they continue this delicate dance of love and longing, one question lingers in the air: Will their unusual arrangement stand the test of time?",
