  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story is set thousands of years in the future, where humanity has advanced into space and divided into two factions: the autocratic Galactic Empire and the democratic Free Planets Alliance. These two superpowers have been locked in intermittent war for 150 years by the start of the story, which takes place near the end of the 8th age of the space calendar. The Empire is led by the tactical genius Reinhard von Lohengramm, while the charismatic Yang Wen-li commands the Alliance forces. After Yang captures the strategically critical Iserlohn Fortress from the Empire, the emboldened Alliance begins pushing deeper into Imperial territory. However, Reinhard is determined to continue the unification of the universe begun by his best friend Siegfried Kircheis. As the two rivals repeatedly clash on an expanding scale, the neutral Dominion of Fezzan, ruled by the shadowy Adrian Rubinsky, schemes to exploit the conflict for its own political gain. One of Rubinsky's subordinates, Rupert Kesserling, plays his own long game while hiding Fezzanâ€™s involvement behind a facade of non-interference. The stage is set for an epic showdown between military masterminds commanding massive space armadas, even as secretive third parties maneuver unseen in the darkness between stars. The actions of these larger-than-life figures at a pivotal point in human history will determine the fate of their civilizations.",
