  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows a group of young female soldiers stationed in a fortress town. They go about their daily lives of military training and duties, while also finding small joys in activities like distilling wine. However, they hide a secret distillery from their newest and energetic recruit Kanata. When she grows suspicious on the day a visitor comes to town, the commanding officer Felicia hatches a plan. She proposes a mock battle where Kanata can learn the truth about their hidden room if she wins. But things spiral out of control when alcohol gets added to the competition. In another story that takes place after the seriesâ€™ conclusion, one of the local children asks Kanata about her dreams and goals. Unable to provide an answer, Kanata has conversations with the other soldiers about their hopes and aspirations for the future. Through these tales both humorous and reflective, the bonds of the fortress residents are highlighted against the backdrop of their dedicated military service. Their dreams take form through camaraderie and their daily lives find meaning through duty.",
