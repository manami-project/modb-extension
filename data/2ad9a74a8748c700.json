In the first extra episode, the girls find themselves in a pickle as Kanata grows suspicious of their clandestine calvados brewing operation. To divert her attention, they stage a mock battle with an intriguing wager. But as the alcohol flows, the situation spirals out of control! The second bonus episode takes a more introspective turn as Kanata, now a seasoned member of the clocktower fortress, ponders her dreams and aspirations. To gain some perspective, she initiates a heartfelt conversation with her comrades about their own future goals. Will Kanata discover her dream amidst their shared wisdom? Tune in to find out!",
