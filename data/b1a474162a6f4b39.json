    "text": "Government factions and their adversaries have their eyes set on Yonna, a young girl with extraordinary abilities, and her protective older brother, Stan. Living in seclusion in a distant fortress, Yonna and Stan have been ostracized by their fellow villagers due to their mysterious powers.\n\nThe king and his enemies are eager to exploit Yonna's abilities for their own gain, but Stan vehemently rebuffs any attempts at contact. Enter Garuda, a determined agent tasked with infiltrating the fortress and freeing Yonna. However, he's not the only one who has made it inside; a rival agent named Piggot has also managed to gain entry, harboring his own ulterior motives.\n\nAs the Imperial Government grows increasingly interested in Yonna and Stan's powers, agents are dispatched to capture them by any means necessary. With Stan fiercely guarding his younger sister, and Piggot employing deceit to achieve his goals, Garuda faces a daunting challenge in completing his mission.\n\nFeaturing stunning character design and facial expressions by Kengo Takeuchi, renowned for his work on Final Fantasy - The Movie, this captivating 30-minute film promises a unique and immersive experience.",
