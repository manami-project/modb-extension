    "text": "As a young boy, Souma Yukihira's life revolved around honing his culinary skills under the watchful eye of his chef father, with the aspiration of one day surpassing him and taking over their family-owned restaurant. However, when his father abruptly closes the establishment to refine his abilities in Europe, Souma is thrust into the prestigious Tootsuki Culinary Academy, where the competition is fierce, and the graduation rate is a mere 10%. The academy is renowned for its high-stakes cooking battles, known as 'Shokugeki', where students compete to settle disputes and demonstrate their culinary prowess. Faced with an unforgiving curriculum and an elite student body, Souma must adapt to this ruthless environment and rely on his creativity, skill, and daring culinary creations to rise to the top and fulfill his dream. Will Souma's talent be enough to conquer the challenges that await him, or will the heat of the kitchen prove to be too much?",
