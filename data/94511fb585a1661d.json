    "text": "Ward's neon-lit Kabukicho district, a vibrant yet chaotic area known for its red-light district, is home to a group of eccentric detectives led by the fastidious and rakugo-loving Sherlock Holmes. As the city's darkness hides behind its bright lights, the detectives are put to the test when the infamous serial killer, Jack the Ripper, begins a deadly crime spree. Among the detectives is John H. Watson, a university hospital employee who initially sought out Sherlock's help with a peculiar case. As Watson becomes more involved with the detective lifestyle, he begins to uncover the true nature of the chaotic city and the mystery behind his own case. With a mix of suspense and comedy, this indistinguishable drama unfolds in the heart of Kabukicho, where the detectives of Mrs. Hudson's tenement work to solve the bizarre murders plaguing the city.",
