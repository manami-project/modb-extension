    "text": "After going their separate ways, Yoshika Miyafuji returns to her quiet hometown, thanks to arrangements made by her former superior Mio Sakamoto for Yoshika to study medicine abroad in Europe. She embarks on this new journey accompanied by Shizuka Hattori, Sakamoto's protégé from the naval academy. However, their studies are disrupted by ominous signs of emerging Neuroi threats. Soon the old members of the now disbanded 501st Joint Fighter Wing reconvene one by one from across the globe. Miyafuji and Hattori ultimately come face-to-face with a formidable Neuroi, heralding a call to action for the once-scattered 501st squadron.",
