    "text": "Newcomer Rei Izumi is tasked with forming a specialized team to combat the alarming rise of drug-related crimes in Japan as part of the newly created STAND unit within the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. As a unique scout with an immunity to most drugs, Rei must recruit a diverse group of agents, investigators, and informants to help her take on this daunting task. However, each potential candidate brings their own set of challenges and ideologies, making the recruitment process more difficult than Rei anticipated. As she navigates the dangerous underworld of drugs, Rei's capabilities as a narcotics officer are put to the test, and she quickly realizes that the world of drug regulation is filled with deceit and unpredictability. Based on the popular mobile game of the same name, \"Stand My Heroes: Piece of Truth\" follows Rei's journey as she works to protect the citizens of Tokyo from the hazardous drugs flooding its streets.",
