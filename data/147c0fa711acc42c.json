    "text": "Urie Sogami, Shiki Natsumezaka, Mage Nanashiro, and their dashing leader, Rem Kaginuki, form the student council that unexpectedly summons the unsuspecting Ritsuka Tachibana. As a model student, she is bewildered by this turn of events, only to find out that the council members have hidden intentions. Her life takes a drastic turn when her mother is kidnapped, and she is unwittingly dragged into a perilous world of vampires and devils. Both factions are in pursuit of the 'Grimoire,' a forbidden artifact that grants its possessor ultimate power.\n\nRitsuka's hope for normalcy is briefly restored by her brother Lindo's return from abroad, but even he seems to be concealing secrets. As she navigates this treacherous landscape, Ritsuka struggles to determine who to trust while simultaneously grappling with her burgeoning feelings for the captivating student council members. Amidst the chaos, Ritsuka must confront the reality that her once-balanced life has been irrevocably shattered by the revelation that her charming classmates are, in fact, demons. In this dark musical tale, Ritsuka finds herself both desired and drawn to the very beings she should fear.",
