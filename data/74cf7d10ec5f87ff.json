    "text": "Hiryuu Palace's sole heir, Princess Yona, is accustomed to a life of luxury and protection, sheltered by her pacifist father, King Il, and her devoted childhood friend and bodyguard, Hak. On the eve of her 16th birthday, Yona's world is shattered when she discovers her beloved cousin, Soo-won, has assassinated her father to claim the throne. Heartbroken and betrayed, Yona and Hak flee the palace, seeking refuge in Hak's hometown.\n\nDetermined to reclaim her kingdom and avenge her father, Yona embarks on a journey to find the legendary Crimson Dragon King and his four Dragon Warriors, guided by the wisdom of a monk named Ik-Soo. As Yona navigates the perils of her new reality, she must grow from a naive princess into a strong and resilient leader, forging alliances and learning the true meaning of power and sacrifice. With Hak by her side, Yona will stop at nothing to restore peace to the kingdom of Kouka and protect her people from those who seek to harm them.",
