    "text": "Peace Maker Kurogane follows 15-year-old Tetsunosuke Ichimura in 1860s Japan during the late Tokugawa shogunate. After witnessing his parents' murder by an extremist faction, a traumatized yet determined Tetsunosuke joins the Shinsengumi - an elite group charged with upholding peace in Kyoto. Though lacking the ruthless skills required, Tetsunosuke perseveres with the support of his older brother Tatsunosuke and new Shinsengumi comrades. But unbeknownst to Tetsunosuke, his and Tatsunosuke's father was an influential reformist called the \"Peacemaker\" - a revelation brought to light by the mysterious swordsman Ryoma Sakamoto. As political tensions mount, the Shinsengumi relocates and prepares for battle against imperial forces aiming to end the shogunate. Amidst the swirling chaos, Tetsunosuke confronts the bloodshed of war, the complex ideologies at clash, and the sacrifices demanded of those who dedicate themselves to a cause. Through painful trials, the young page comes to reconsider revenge, strength, and what it truly means to pursue peace.",
