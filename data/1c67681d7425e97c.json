    "text": "The Storm tells an epic tale spanning three thousand years. It begins with two legendary martial artists, Bu Jingyun and Nie Feng, who face an impending global catastrophe. To survive, they transform themselves into quantum states with the aid of mysterious mentors. Three millennia later, an asteroid collision has rendered Earth a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Humanity survives underground, discovering a powerful inner energy called \"pulse energy.\" An orphan named Bu Tianyun accidentally awakens the sleeping Bu Jingyun from within a meteorite. Bu Tianyun realizes his own pulse energy potential, which allows him to begin training as a \"pulse warrior.\" Together with Nie Feng's successor Nie Zifeng, Bu Tianyun embarks on a journey to master pulse energy in order to protect the world. They face this monumental task as the last vestiges of a glorious age, hoping to usher in a new era for humanity.",
