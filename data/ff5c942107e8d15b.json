  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Guardians of Earth and malevolent beings from the Dark World are on a collision course once again, 30,000 years after their first epic battle. In the initial encounter, the Guardians managed to seal the gate connecting the two realms by sacrificing a boy named Kairen, the Key. The Remnants, as these dark entities are known, were left stranded on Earth and forced to live as ordinary humans.\n\nThe heroine, Jinno Hazumi, played a pivotal role in defeating the Remnant leader, Kijima Touta, with the assistance of her loyal allies, Chiryuu and Tenku. As a result, Kijima's memories were erased, and he too lived as a human. However, as the 30,000-year mark approaches, the remaining Remnants regain their memories and revert to their original forms, signaling the impending opening of the gate.\n\nIn modern times, the battlefield has shifted to the unlikeliest of places: Tobira High School. Here, a new generation of Guardians must balance their everyday lives with their responsibility to protect the world from the impending darkness. As the Remnants grow stronger, the Guardians must risk everything to keep the gate sealed and prevent the cycle of love, hate, and war from repeating itself. Will they succeed, or will history tragically repeat itself?",
