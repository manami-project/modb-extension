    "text": "Included in the \"Ghibli ga Ippai Special Short Twin Box\" DVD, \"Dore Dore no Uta\" is a delightful 3-minute animated music video by the renowned Studio Ghibli. The video features a lively girl strumming her guitar and singing her way through an extraordinary city, where the inhabitants are none other than insects. Despite the daily challenges they face, from the looming winter to the risk of being run over by cars, the bugs continue to thrive in harmony. This charming city sees bugs commuting to work on a caterpillar train, while ants and beetles collaborate on impressive construction projects. The video serves as a visual accompaniment to the single by Meiko Haigo, creating a captivating blend of music and animation.",
