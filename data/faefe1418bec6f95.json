  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japanese folklore meets modern eccentricity in this comedic tale of Kohina Ichimatsu, a young girl who refers to herself as a doll. Living alone and subsisting on a diet of cup ramen, Kohina's life takes a dramatic turn when she summons a low-ranking fox spirit, Kokkuri-san, through a divination game. The handsome, white-haired spirit, who has lost much of his power due to waning belief in the supernatural, initially intends to haunt Kohina. However, his concern for her unhealthy lifestyle and solitary existence leads him to assume a maternal role, preparing meals and protecting her from the world's peculiarities.\n\nAs Kohina's life becomes increasingly bizarre, she encounters additional supernatural beings, including Inugami, a two-faced dog spirit with a soft spot for Kohina, and Shigaraki, an alcoholic, gambling tanuki spirit. Despite his initial intentions, Kokkuri-san finds himself entrenched in Kohina's life, striving to provide the guidance and care she needs while navigating the chaos that ensues from their unusual living arrangement. Prepare for a whimsical journey filled with laughter, heartwarming moments, and a touch of the extraordinary as Kohina and her supernatural companions embrace their unconventional daily life.",
