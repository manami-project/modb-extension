  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ueno Zoo, a once vibrant sanctuary for animals in Tokyo, became a site of tragedy during World War II. As the threat of Allied bombings loomed, zoo officials made the heart-wrenching decision to slaughter dangerous animals to prevent potential chaos if the animals were to escape. The methods employed were as brutal as they were varied, including starvation, poisoning, firing squads, and decapitation. Despite the animals' tragic fate, the zoo itself remained untouched by the bombings that ravaged Tokyo over a year later.\n\nIn the aftermath of war, a touching tale unfolds when a devoted brother, Hide, vows to his critically ill sister, Miyoko, that he will arrange for her to see a real elephant. His quest leads him to the zoo, where an old man recounts the harrowing tale of the zoo animals' demise. However, the story doesn't end there. Inspired by true events, the narrative concludes with the arrival of Indira, an elephant gifted by the Prime Minister of India in 1949, offering a glimmer of hope and renewal. This poignant tale, originally penned as a children's book by Ren Saito for his daughter, explores themes of loss, promise, and the unyielding bond between siblings.",
