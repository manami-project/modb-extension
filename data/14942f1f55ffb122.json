  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Spirits of Cairn is set in a melancholic limbo, inhabited by those who died young. We follow a nameless protagonist carrying deep regrets from his past life, though the specific source eludes him. For reasons unknown, he is doomed to eternally bury the necks of children peeking from the dirt. Despite the gloom, mysteries abound in this purgatory. How long has the protagonist been toiling? Why is he here at all? The questions loom as large as the role he plays in this afterlife. Through vivid visuals, Spirits of Cairn explores the tragedy of lost innocence and the echoes left behind. Created as a graduation project, the anime promises to linger in viewers' minds just as our protagonist lingers between worlds. Will his labor ever end? Or is oblivion the only escape from this twilight state?",
