    "text": "Ever since watching a magic show by famous illusionist Mamoru Hoshisato and his wife Maeve, young Makoto Shiranui has dreamed of becoming a magician himself. He travels to Tokyo to apprentice under Mamoru, a family friend. Also living in the Hoshisato residence, a rumored haunted mansion, is Mamoru's daughter Hatena, Makoto's childhood friend. Though Tokyo has seen a recent string of burglaries by a mysterious female thief, Makoto feels reassured by Hatena's presence. Upon arriving, Makoto is welcomed by the Hoshisato's eccentric staff, including butler Jeeves and maid Emma. However, Makoto is surprised to find his childhood bond with Hatena now strained. As Makoto begins his magical training under Mamoru, he strives both to fulfill his promise to become a skillful illusionist and to mend his fractured friendship with Hatena.",
