  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Above the vast Serengeti plains of Africa, a young girl named Persia spent her formative years in harmony with the wildlife. When she's brought to Japan by the Muroi twins, Riki and Gaku, and their grandfather, Gouken, her life takes an unexpected turn. During the flight, Persia is whisked away to the enchanting realm of Lovely Dream, where she encounters the Fairy Queen. The queen reveals that Lovely Dream is in peril and seeks Persia's help.\n\nEquipped with a magical headband that can summon a mystical baton, Persia is granted the ability to transform into a teenage girl and wield magic. Her mission: to gather love energy to restore Lovely Dream and prevent Riki and Gaku from being transformed into women should she fail or be discovered using magic. Joined by three kappa and her beloved lion-turned-cat companion, Persia embarks on a heartwarming journey to collect love energy and save the dreams of Lovely Dream. Along the way, she learns valuable lessons about life, love, and the magic within herself.",
