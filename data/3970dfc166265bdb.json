    "text": "Shimarisu the chipmunk, Araiguma the raccoon, and Bonobono the kind-hearted sea otter are the best of friends living near a sprawling forest. Each day brings new, small adventures for this lovable trio, with Shimarisu's mischievous antics and Araiguma's short temper keeping life interesting for the good-natured Bonobono.
