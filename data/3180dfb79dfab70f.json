  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tortov Roddle is a quiet and introspective traveler journeying through surreal landscapes on the back of his unusually long-legged pig companion. As he passes through mysterious towns and meets their whimsical inhabitants, he has a series of gently contemplative adventures that blend dreamlike wonder with thoughtful rumination on life's strangeness. Though few words are exchanged, much emotion and meaning are conveyed through the expressive inhabitants, fantastical scenery, and symbolic events that Tortov encounters on his ongoing odyssey. With its creative visuals and thoughtful ethos, this series promises to take viewers on a journey both externally through delightfully surreal vignettes and internally to reflect on the subjective nature of reality and the self.",
