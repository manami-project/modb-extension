  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Son Gohan and Videl struggle to keep peace in Satan City when an elderly man named Hoy warns them of an impending threat - the terrible dragon Hildegarn. Long ago, Hildegarn was created by dark magicians and went on a rampage before being sealed within two brothers, Tapion and Minotia. Hoy believes the seal is weakening and that Tapion, having been trapped in a mystical music box, must be set free to slay the dragon once again. Thanks to the power of the Dragon Balls, the Z-Fighters release Tapion from his captivity. Though initially distrustful, Tapion reluctantly allies with the heroes to confront his sworn enemy. As Hoy feared, the seal on Hildegarn has indeed begun to break. Now free after eons of imprisonment, the vicious dragon descends on Satan City, overwhelming even Earth's mightiest warriors. With the fate of the world at stake, Tapion alone wields the knowledge and power to challenge Hildegarn. But can he triumph where so many others have failed? An epic battle is about to unfold with the city and potentially the entire planet hanging in the balance.",
