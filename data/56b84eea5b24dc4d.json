    "text": "Without the limelight, unsung heroes of the sports world take center stage in this anime/documentary series presented by NHK. Drawn from Tomoyoshi Itou and Shingo Morita's Weekly Young Jump biographical manga 'Eikou Naki Tensai-tachi' (Geniuses Without Glory), the series sheds light on the extraordinary lives of athletes who have left an indelible mark on their respective sports.\n\nThe first episode delves into the life of Hironoshin Furuhashi, famously known as 'the flying fish of Fujiyama.' Adapted from the manga, Furuhashi's story is a testament to the unwavering spirit of a swimmer who revolutionized the Japanese competitive swimming world. The episode also features exclusive interviews with Olympic swimmer Kousuke Kitajima and other prominent Japanese swimmers, offering a unique insight into Furuhashi's impact on the sport and the grueling training required to become an Olympic swimmer.\n\nIn the next episode, titled 'Rikujou' (track and field), the focus shifts to the inspiring journey of Japanese sprinter Takashi Yoshioka, continuing the series' commitment to highlighting the untold stories of remarkable athletes.",
