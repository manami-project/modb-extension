    "text": "Fantasium Garden, a seemingly ordinary theme park, harbors a secret. It's a sanctuary for individuals known as 'Attractors' - humans who have awakened to extraordinary abilities. Among these Attractors is Quon Mitsuchi, a resolute and optimistic boy determined to safeguard his kind.\n\nIn a not-so-distant future, fear and misunderstanding have led to the formation of Custos, a clandestine organization hell-bent on eradicating Attractors. Custos employs an elite group of cyborgs, the WTOC, to carry out their mission, viewing Attractors as threats to societal order.\n\nQuon, however, refuses to let his fellow Attractors become victims of unjust persecution. Rallying them together, they prepare to face off against the formidable WTOC. As intense battles unfold, Quon's unwavering determination shines through, igniting a beacon of hope for the survival of Attractors.\n\nJoin Quon and his allies in their daring quest for acceptance and survival, as they challenge the very forces that seek to extinguish their existence.",
