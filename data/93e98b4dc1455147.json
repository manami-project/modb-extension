Known as \"Attractors,\" these gifted people possess a diverse range of abilities. As Kestos ruthlessly hunts them down, the Attractors band together in resistance. Led by a determined boy named Quon, the Attractors fight to defend their right to exist. Quon rallies this persecuted community, vowing to save his fellow Attractors no matter the cost. Though vastly outmatched, this group wages a courageous battle for survival inside the fantastical theme park Fantasium Garden. They engage in intense clashes with Kestos's cyborg exterminators, called WTOC. Despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them, the valiant Attractors persist in their crusade. Fueled by Quon's inspirational optimism, they continue striving to end the oppression brought upon them by Kestos.
