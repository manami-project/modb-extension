    "text": "This thrilling installment of Boku no Hero Academia, titled \"Sukue! Kyuujo Kunren!\", follows the determined students of class 1-A at UA High School as they strive to complete their rescue training amidst unexpected challenges. After a shocking villain attack during a previous training session left some teachers severely injured, the school is under pressure to regain public trust.\n\nDespite the setbacks, the ambitious Izuku 'Deku' Midoriya and his fellow classmates persist in honing their unique quirks, preparing to face diverse situations and environments. However, the training center is not as secure as it seems; a masked figure lurks in the shadows, hinting at the possible return of the villains responsible for the earlier attack.\n\nAs class 1-A braces for another potential confrontation, they must ask themselves: are they ready to stand against the forces of evil? This OVA, initially screened at Jump Festa 2016 and later bundled with the 13th volume of the manga, promises a thrilling ride filled with action, growth, and camaraderie.",
