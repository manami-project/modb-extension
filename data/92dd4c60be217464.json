  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mars—the legendary God of War—is said to have left behind an armor of unparalleled power, divided into six elusive pieces. The Armor of Mars promises godlike strength to anyone from the ancient warrior Godimus' bloodline who can find and assemble all the pieces. However, a dark curse looms: the chosen one would also lose their sanity and become an unstoppable, mindless killing machine.\n\nLaocorn Gaudeamus, a young millionaire and one of the last descendants of Godimus, has already obtained three pieces of the armor. As he edges closer to his goal, his twin sister Sulia fears the worst and enlists the help of Terry Bogard and his friends to stop Laocorn from fulfilling the curse.\n\nTerry, Andy, Joe, and Mai embark on a global crusade to recover the remaining pieces before Laocorn does, but they must face his formidable allies and stay one step ahead of his relentless pursuit. Can they prevent the Armor of Mars from unleashing an uncontrollable force of destruction upon the world, or will they succumb to Laocorn's growing power? The fate of the world hangs in the balance as the race to find the legendary armor intensifies.",
