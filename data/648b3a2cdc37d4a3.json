  "synopsis": {
    "text": "To the casual observer, Miyano is just an ordinary high school student with a penchant for Boys' Love manga and a slight insecurity about his soft features. However, his ordinary life takes a dramatic turn when he crosses paths with Sasaki, a senior with a delinquent reputation. Intrigued by Miyano's unexpected bravery during a confrontation, Sasaki seizes every opportunity to get closer to him. As their unlikely bond deepens, Sasaki's initial fascination evolves into something more profound. Meanwhile, Miyano, a self-proclaimed Boys' Love aficionado, remains oblivious to the fact that he's become a character in his favorite genre. As they navigate their unique relationship, Sasaki is determined to steer them towards a happily ever after straight out of the pages of Miyano's beloved manga.",
