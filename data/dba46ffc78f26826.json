    "text": "Set during the tumultuous Bakumatsu era in Japan, the anime follows Shinsaku Takasugi, a passionate samurai warrior, and his comrade Kogoro Katsura. Seeking to change the course of history, the pair infiltrate a government ship in hopes of stealing a legendary pocket watch called the \"Jishingi\" which is said to possess the power to control time. Though they successfully obtain the artifact, it is promptly stolen by a mysterious woman in black. Takasugi and Katsura pursue the thief to Kyoto, but are shocked to discover the city much changed - the government has been overthrown and replaced by the deity Susanoo. As they investigate the strange events surrounding them, they cross paths with an enigmatic young woman who has herself traveled through time using the mystical pocket watch they seek. Though coming from different eras, she and Takasugi share an undeniable connection. Against the backdrop of a nation in turmoil, with the fate of history hanging in the balance, an unlikely romance blooms between the noble samurai and the woman from the future. Together they become determined to unlock the secrets of the magical timepiece in order to save Japan from those who would abuse its power.",
