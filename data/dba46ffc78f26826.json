Choshu samurai Shinsaku Takasugi and his ally Kogoro Katsura infiltrate the ship to seize the artifact, intending to destroy it to prevent its misuse.

Determined to save their country from those who seek to control time, the duo vows to reset the timeline and restore their homeland.\n\nMeanwhile, a young woman is unexpectedly transported from modern-day Kyoto to the Bakumatsu era when a mysterious man gives her a pocket watch.
