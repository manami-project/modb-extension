This revelation ignites a spark of competition among the trio, as they each strive to prove their worth and secure a spot in the coveted event.\n\nAs the festival approaches, the girls must confront a difficult choice: to pursue their long-held dream at the risk of jeopardizing their friendship, or to preserve the precious bond they have formed. Set against the enchanting backdrop of Kyoto, this poignant tale explores the delicate balance between ambition and loyalty.",
