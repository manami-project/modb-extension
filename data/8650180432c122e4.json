  "synopsis": {
    "text": "World War II's devastating aftermath unfolds in this poignant anime, set in the heart of Hiroshima, where the lingering shadows of radioactive black rain continue to haunt the survivors and their descendants. The story delves deep into the emotional turmoil and enduring hatred harbored by some Japanese people in the wake of the catastrophic event.\n\nAt the center of the narrative is Stand Akauma, a local bar that serves as a sanctuary for a group of survivors, known as hibakusha. Among them is Takeshi, a man grappling with the loss of his entire family; Tomoko, a scarred prostitute who endured the brunt of the bombing; and her marginalized younger brother, Junji. As their lives intertwine, the story introduces Eiko, a young pregnant woman loved by Junji, and Yuri, a determined prostitute striving for a better future for her blind son. This powerful anime interweaves their heartrending tales, offering a profound exploration of resilience, hope, and the enduring human spirit amidst unfathomable tragedy.",
