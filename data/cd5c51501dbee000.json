    "text": "Yuuko's mischievous spirit causes ghost stories to spread around the school, frustrating Kirie. In an attempt to curb Yuuko's antics, Kirie challenges her to a competition, threatening that Yuuko must behave if she loses. Meanwhile, the Paranormal Investigation Club explores a collection of mysteries hidden in an old book discovered by Momoe. One by one, the club members including Teiichi, Yuuko, and Kirie investigate these strange tales, leading them to face increasingly absurd situations - from a s√©ance gone wrong to a haunted bathhouse. Despite the ridiculousness, the determined group presses on to uncover the truth behind these peculiar school legends. With Yuuko's spirited nature landing the club in uncanny predicaments, one can only imagine what awaits them next in their paranormal adventures. Will they unravel the secrets behind the ghost stories or find themselves spiraling deeper into the unknown?",
