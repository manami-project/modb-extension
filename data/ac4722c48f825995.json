    "text": "An elderly married couple resides in a quaint Japanese village, earning their modest living by crafting beautiful blooms. Having spent their entire lives together, they now face fresh hardship as the wife exhibits concerning symptoms possibly stemming from illness. Though she soldiers on, her condition presents new difficulties for their floral business. Yet despite these obstacles, the enduring bond between the two continues to blossom. This poignant animated tale from Aya Tsugehata offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of two lifelong partners as they confront the realities of aging and mortality with steadfast devotion. Though brief in runtime, Tsugehata's graduate project promises to water the soul with its sincere exploration of love, loyalty, and the labors that have rooted this couple through the seasons.",
