As Kazuya develops a new hobby, he discovers that his camera is not just a gadget, but a tool that could transform his social life. Joining the school's photography club, he begins to see the girls around him from fresh perspectives. But it's not all smooth sailing for Kazuya, as he finds himself torn between two clubs: one that values the creative and moral aspects of photography, and another that focuses on secretive, exposing shots of unsuspecting girls. Will Kazuya's newfound passion for photography help him connect with the beautiful girls in school, or will he get caught up in the wrong side of the lens? Follow Kazuya's journey as he navigates the world of photography and discovers its unexpected challenges and rewards.",
