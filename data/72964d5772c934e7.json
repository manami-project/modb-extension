    "text": "Film synopsis: In the midst of a tranquil era, two friends, Maru-san and Kaku-san, find their curiosity piqued during a night of leisurely drinking as they stumble upon a grand military parade. As they delve deeper into the spectacle, they embark on a global exploration of the military prowess of various nations, discovering that Japan's forces are the humblest in comparison. Eager to uncover the true intentions of each country, they eavesdrop on an international arms control conference. This engaging anime offers a rare glimpse into a world of military might and diplomatic intrigue, with only one surviving volume of the series preserved at the National Film Center in Tokyo.\n\n(Please note that the names Sumi-san and Mr. Square were replaced with Kaku-san as they seemed to be inconsistencies in the provided synopses.)",
