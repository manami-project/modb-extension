  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A lonely monkey is born from stone high atop a mountain, with no name, parents, or friends. One day he meets RinRin, a kind female monkey who becomes his friend and encourages him to prove his bravery to the other monkeys. After passing a courageous test, the monkey is made king. However, the power goes to his head - he becomes vain and arrogant. Seeking greater challenges, the monkey king leaves RinRin and journeys to train with a sage hermit in the mountains. The hermit names the monkey Son-Goku and teaches him magical abilities. Empowered but unchecked by humility, Son-Goku travels to Heaven to challenge the very gods themselves, who defeat him. As punishment for his arrogance, Son-Goku is sentenced to accompany a monk on a journey to learn wisdom and restraint. This begins another adventure for the headstrong monkey, who still has much to learn about life, power, and what it truly means to rule.",
