    "text": "Andy, the robot, and his eccentric crew of alien performers find their lives forever changed when they collide with an unknown spacecraft. The only survivor is a human baby girl, Corona, who becomes their newfound responsibility. Stranded on a nearby planet, the motley crew, including the cat-like Beruka and the brainy Tah, use data from the crashed ship's computer to recreate a semblance of Earth life for Corona. As she grows from an infant to a young child, Corona's unconventional family engages in heartwarming adventures like mock dragonfly rescues and family field days. However, when a mysterious transmission hints at Corona's true family searching for her, the crew must confront the possibility of losing the little girl who brought them together.",
