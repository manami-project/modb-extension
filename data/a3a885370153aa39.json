    "text": "Emeralda, the Duchess of Sanborn, is vanishing, and Cobra, her devoted protector, must delve into her past to unravel the mystery behind her disappearance. As he embarks on a journey through time, he encounters a world where Emeralda was still a human, with a heart of flesh and blood, rather than the metal body she now possesses. Along the way, Cobra must confront his own past, including the menacing adversaries that once threatened Emeralda's life. As he navigates through this perilous journey, Cobra must also face the ghosts of his own memories, all in a desperate bid to save Emeralda from fading away into oblivion. Will he be able to uncover the truth behind her mysterious condition and save her before it's too late? Only time will tell.",
