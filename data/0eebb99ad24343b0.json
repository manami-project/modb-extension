    "text": "Horse play and inheritance collide in this enthralling anime, as Suekichi Terayama, a college student and member of the avant-garde theater troupe Bondage Horse, finds himself in a whirlwind of unexpected events. When his great-grandfather passes away, Suekichi is left with a hefty inheritance of 450 million yen, but there's a catch: he must graduate from college and start a career to claim it.\n\nAs if navigating his newfound wealth and academic responsibilities weren't enough, Suekichi discovers a seductive woman named Aya in his bed the morning after the funeral. Aya's intentions seem questionable, but her allure proves irresistible to Suekichi.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Suekichi must juggle the affections of Aya, the demands of his great-grandfather's lawyer, the interest of a theater-loving yakuza, and the presence of Aya's ex-husband. With the captivating Miyuki also in the mix, Suekichi's life takes a series of unpredictable turns, leading him down a path of desire, suspicion, and the complexities of love. Will he be able to keep his life from spiraling out of control and secure his inheritance? Only time will tell.",
