  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Much like any other ordinary fourth-grader, Taira Capeta, affectionately known as Capeta, masks his loneliness behind a facade of resilience. Having lost his mother at a tender age, he strives to be self-reliant to prevent further burdening his overworked father. One day, his father, inspired by a go-kart race, surprises Capeta with a makeshift racing cart constructed from discarded parts. Despite its initial lack of an engine and a bent frame, Capeta's natural talent for racing shines through as he manages to outpace Minamoto Naomi, the reigning East Japan Junior Cart champion. Recognizing Capeta's potential, Naomi's mother encourages him to participate in the official race, igniting a spark of passion in Capeta's heart for the world of competitive go-kart racing. Alongside his friends Nobu and Monami, Capeta embarks on a thrilling journey to achieve his dreams, despite the financial hardships that lie ahead.",
