  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Monkey Turn is a sports anime that centers around professional speed boat racing. The story follows Tadano Kenji, a young man who dreams of becoming a professional baseball player but is deemed too short. His baseball coach instead recommends he try boat racing. One day, Kenji unexpectedly reunites with his old girlfriend. They make a promise - if she remains faithful to him, he must become Japan's best boat racer within 3 years. Kenji joins a training school and develops a special boat maneuver called the \"Monkey Turn.\" This gives him an edge over his competitors, but reaching the top spot in such a short time will be hugely challenging. Ultimately, Monkey Turn is about pursuing your dreams despite the obstacles in your path. It explores themes of ambition, competition, young romance and finding alternative routes when your initial goals are blocked. With hard work and ingenuity, Kenji strives to become number one. But will his Monkey Turn be enough to defeat the reigning champions?",
