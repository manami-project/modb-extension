  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Makoto is a brilliant but unassuming high school student working on an experimental device, when his rival Jinnai sabotages the experiment out of jealousy. This causes a dimensional rift that transports Makoto, Jinnai, Jinnai's sister Nanami, and their teacher Mr. Fujisawa to the magnificent world of El Hazard. Upon arriving, the group becomes separated. Makoto lands in the kingdom of Roshtaria and befriends Princess Rune, using his scientific knowledge to help the kingdom. Meanwhile, Jinnai throws his lot in with the Bugrom, a race of giant insects trying to conquer El Hazard. His sister Nanami tries to survive on her own in the desert, while Mr. Fujisawa ends up helping the Alliance fight against the Bugrom. As Makoto searches for a way to return home, he must also defend Roshtaria against threats like the demon god Ifurita. Jinnai plots to take over El Hazard by leading the Bugrom in war against the other kingdoms. The stranded high schoolers find adventure and purpose in this strange new world, but also danger, as theyâ€™re caught up in the brewing conflict.",
