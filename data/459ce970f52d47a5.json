  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the Kanto region of Japan, seven rival high schools are locked in a constant struggle for supremacy. Their students carry sacred magatama jewels harboring the spirits of ancient Chinese warriors, granting them great fighting power. 17-year-old Hakufu Sonsaku, a skilled yet ditzy fighter, transfers to Nanyo Academy, one of the seven schools. Her arrival creates tension among Nanyo's strongest students, known as \"The Big Four,\" who view her as a threat. Unbeknownst to Hakufu, she carries the spirit of the legendary warrior Sun Ce within her magatama. She also possesses a strange inner power that surfaces when she is enraged, wreaking havoc. Hakufu aims to unite the feuding schools under her banner, as was her destiny. However, she must harness her power before it destroys her. With help from her protective cousin Koukin and Nanyo's Big Four, Hakufu takes on rival schools in intense battles as she pursues her goal. Yet darker forces seem intent on orchestrating her downfall. To fulfill her destiny, she must uncover the truth behind the warring schools and her own fate.",
