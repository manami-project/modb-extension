  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryosuke Kaga is a high school boy with an openly perverted nature. However, beneath this crass exterior lies a caring heart sworn to protect women. His life takes an unexpected turn when he meets Lisara Restor, an elite Grim Reaper dispatched to the human world. Needing spiritual energy to operate, Lisara forms a contract with Ryosuke, siphoning power from his abundant lecherous spirit. As the two strangely paired companions search for a singularly gifted person Lisara seeks, they encounter otherworldly beings and unravel dark secrets. Though fulfilling the contract proves awkward, Ryosuke finds purpose in assisting Lisara's noble cause while gaining insight into the complexities enveloping them. Ultimately, the profound bond they build teaches Ryosuke the true meaning of chivalry. This supernatural drama with comedic overtones promises outrageous hijinks and insight into the human condition. The central odd couple provides both fan service and heart as they navigate peril and intimacy in a realm rife with mystery.",
