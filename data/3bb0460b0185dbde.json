  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unless otherwise stated, the world has begun to witness an unprecedented wave of psychic evolution, giving rise to powerful Espers. Among these, three young girls stand out: Kaoru, the impetuous psychokinetic who can manipulate objects with her thoughts; Shiho, the sharp-tongued and enigmatic psychometric capable of delving into people's minds and uncovering the histories of lifeless objects; and Aoi, the calm and composed teleporter who can transport herself and others at will.\n\nTo manage these burgeoning psychic prodigies, the Base of Backing ESP Laboratory, or B.A.B.E.L., is established. The organization aims to harness the potential of these Espers, including the aforementioned trio known as \"The Children,\" to address the escalating psychic evolution. However, the task of overseeing these pre-teen girls falls to the weary Koichi Minamoto, a young man grappling with the daunting responsibility of commanding this formidable team.\n\nAs the girls navigate their roles within B.A.B.E.L., they must also contend with the challenges of their unique abilities and the public's perception of them. Can Koichi guide them through these trials and ensure their growth, or will the world succumb to the unpredictable whims of these psychic powerhouses? Join the adventure as The Children explore their extraordinary talents and confront the trials of a rapidly evolving world.",
