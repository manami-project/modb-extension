  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now entering the halls of Karai High School, meet Yukishiro Nanako, a charming and lively 16-year-old with an uncommon quirk: she communicates solely through senryuu, a form of poetry consisting of 17 syllables. Joining her in the Literature Club is the once notorious delinquent, Eiji Busujima, who now finds solace in the art of senryuu. Despite his intimidating appearance, Eiji forms an endearing bond with Nanako, effortlessly exchanging thoughts in 5-7-5 syllable rhythms. Together, they navigate the joyful and comedic complexities of high school life, proving that words are not always necessary to create meaningful connections. Delve into the lighthearted world of Senryuu Shoujo and witness the unique friendship between these two unlikely souls.",
