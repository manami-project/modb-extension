  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a world once torn apart by a civil war between the North and South, the outnumbered North resorted to forbidden dark magic to create formidable super-soldiers known as Incarnates. These part-human, part-beast entities, revered as gods, turned the tides of war and restored peace. However, in the aftermath, these once glorified warriors struggle to reintegrate into society, often feared for their immense power. Enter Nancy Schaal Bancroft, the daughter of an Incarnate, who seeks vengeance against the Beast Hunter responsible for her father's death. As she embarks on her quest, she uncovers the harsh realities and hidden secrets of the Incarnates' lives. Meanwhile, Hank, a former captain of the Incarnates turned Beast Hunter, grapples with his own guilt as he hunts down his former comrades who have succumbed to their inner beasts. The journey of Nancy and Hank intertwines as they navigate through the complexities of the Incarnates' existence and the truth behind their tragic fate.",
