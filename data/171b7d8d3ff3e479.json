  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's Yoshiko Hanabatake, a girl with a unique charm that stems from her profound lack of intelligence. With a peculiar fondness for bananas and an unwavering affection for her childhood friend, Akuru 'A-kun' Akutsu, she navigates through life with a series of absurd antics that leave everyone around her in disbelief. Even her mother has given up hope on her academic prowess, as Yoshiko consistently manages to score zeroes on all her tests.\n\nDespite the chaos that follows her, there's one person who stands firm against her ridiculous behavior - Akuru 'A-kun' Akutsu. A studious and somewhat intimidating character, he takes it upon himself to keep Yoshiko's idiocy in check, often resorting to physical means to knock some sense into her. Yet, his efforts seem futile as Yoshiko bounces back with renewed vigor, dragging others into her whirlwind of nonsense.\n\nThis summer, witness the long-awaited anime adaptation of 'Aho Girl', a hilarious tale of Yoshiko's antics and Akuru's attempts to keep her in check. Prepare for a rollercoaster of laughter and absurdity, as every moment with Yoshiko promises to be unpredictable and entertaining.",
