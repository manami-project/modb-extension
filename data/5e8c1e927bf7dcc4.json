  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Imagine a world in 2039 where androids, designed for various tasks, are as common as everyday electronics. In this world, Keiichiro, a musician who has lost his family and his passion for music, stumbles upon an outdated android model discarded in a garbage heap. Despite being informed that the android, whom he names Flower, is beyond repair, he is taken aback when he finds her functional the next morning, preparing breakfast for him. As the summer unfolds, the two form an unlikely bond - a boy who has lost his dreams and an android devoid of memories. Together, they embark on a journey of self-discovery and healing, with Keiichiro teaching Flower about the intricacies of life and the world around them. This heartwarming tale was initially an independent animation, later adapted into a theatrical release with additional content.",
