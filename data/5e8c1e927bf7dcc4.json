  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2039, helper androids are commonplace, though old models often end up discarded. Keiichiro is a musician struggling with grief after losing his family in an accident. One day while out walking, he finds an outdated Flower model android that has been dumped. Though a repair shop tells him she is beyond fixing, Keiichiro brings the android home. To his surprise, she reactivates and begins caring for him, cooking meals and brightening his lonely existence. Flower has no memories, but Keiichiro nurtures her curiosity about the world. Their unlikely connection leads them on poignant adventures over the course of one summer. Along the way, both find renewal and meaning. Originally released as an independent OVA, Kowarekake no Orgel is a slice-of-life story celebrating compassion. Through Keiichiro and Flower's relationship, the animation conveys that human warmth and kindness can be restorative, no matter what losses one has suffered.",
