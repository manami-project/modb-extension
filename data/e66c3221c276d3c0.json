  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Goro's son, Daigo, is destined for greatness in the world of baseball, or so it seems, given his father's illustrious career as a professional baseball player. Inspired by his father's legacy, Daigo joins the Mifune Dolphins, the same little league team his father once played for, with dreams of becoming an all-star player. However, Daigo's lack of innate talent and baseball sense soon become apparent, leading him to quit the team in less than a year, unable to bear the weight of his father's expectations.\n\nTwo years later, Daigo's world is shaken up by the arrival of a transfer student, Hikaru, the son of Toshiya Satou, a lifelong friend and fellow baseball star of Goro. Despite his father's professional background, Hikaru has never played baseball before, but when he's forced to join a game, he quickly proves to be a natural talent.\n\nDaigo and Hikaru, two boys with vastly different backgrounds and abilities, find themselves drawn into the world of baseball. As they navigate the joys and challenges of the sport, they discover their own paths in the shadow of their fathers' legacies. This is the story of their journey, as they learn to embrace the game and find their place in it.",
