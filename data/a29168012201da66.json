The spirits, who draw their energy from human music, are guided by Dantists, a select group of musicians with the unique ability to command them. Phoron Tatara, a talented Dantist, finds himself partnered with the powerful spirit Corticarte Apa Lagranges, known for her fearsome nicknames, 'The Crimson Annihilator' and 'The Bloody Duchess.'\n\nAs they journey through Polyphonica on Phoron's motorcycle-organ hybrid, the duo encounters various challenges that require their unique skills. Together with their friends, they help the population navigate issues that arise in this world of intertwined human and spirit lives. Along the way, Phoron and Corticarte discover not only the depth of their mutual dependence but also the blossoming of a deep affection for each other. Join them as they embark on a symphony of adventures, weaving a tale of love, friendship, and the power of music.",
