  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tsutomu is an average middle school student focused on studying for his high school entrance exams when his life takes an unexpected turn. While out one day, he accidentally gets caught in the crossfire of an altercation between an intergalactic police officer named Birdy and a dangerous criminal she is pursuing. Tsutomu gets fatally injured, but Birdy manages to save him by bonding their bodies and minds together. Now Tsutomu and Birdy must share the same body as Birdy continues her important work pursuing galactic criminals on Earth. This makes for a rather unusual and often comical forced partnership, as a bookish adolescent boy finds himself tangled up in the adventures of a fierce alien cop. Together they work to take down villains like the nefarious Christella Revi while also navigating Tsutomu's regular teenage life. Along the way, Tsutomu and Birdy build an endearing friendship despite their very different personalities and the sheer absurdity of their situation. As this mismatched pair take on bad guys and everyday challenges alike, they find that their two worlds may not be so different after all.",
