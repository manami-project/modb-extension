  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tyger, a gentle giant mechanic, and Beck, a prodigious 14-year-old hunter with the unique ability to transform into Red Ash, navigate a dystopian future where society is divided between the privileged Purerace and the oppressed Nanorace. The Nanorace, whose genes are infused with nanomachines that grant them extraordinary abilities, are subjected to discrimination and control by the Purerace. Beck, aspiring to become a Purerace, embarks on a perilous journey with Tyger, using their parallel machine to traverse the remnants of the old world.\n\nTheir lives take a dramatic turn when they cross paths with Call, a Purerace girl disguised as a Nanorace, who is relentlessly pursued by the ruthless duo Safari and Stripe, led by the enigmatic Deny. Together, Beck, Tyger, and Call venture into a clockwork world, with their adversaries hot on their heels.\n\nThis captivating anime, part of Anime Tamago 2017's young animator training projects, is the only 3D CG short in the selection. It was successfully crowdfunded through Kickstarter by game company Comcept as a tie-in to its Red Ash: The Indelible Legend game, offering a thrilling adventure that unfolds across diverse parallel worlds.",
