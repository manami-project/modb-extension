    "text": "Ren Aikawa, Yua Nakabeni, and Homi Moemi, three close friends, embark on a new school semester amidst the rainy April weather, surrounded by cherry blossoms and puddles. As they gather near the shoe locker, their conversation revolves around their everyday lives, each with their own unique personalities and interests. Ren, the serious and ambitious one, works part-time at a caf√©, which has seen a surge in customers since her arrival. Meanwhile, Homi, the energetic and bright friend, finds joy in jumping into puddles on rainy days, and Yua, the cheerful yet somewhat naive cosplayer, strives to maintain her anonymity from her Twitter followers with varying success. As the seasons change, these young women experience the ups and downs of high school life, their friendship unwavering as they navigate through the world of tights and growing up.",
