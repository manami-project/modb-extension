    "text": "Futsal has exploded in popularity globally over the past decade. In Japan, the fever is even more intense after native players like Tokinari Tennoji competed on the world stage. His electric play in the U-18 World Cup inspires Haru Yamato to take up the sport himself. Yamato joins the futsal club at Koyo Gakuen High School, eager to follow in Tennoji's footsteps. There he meets a cast of unique personalities - from talented captain Toi Tsukioka, a former U-18 teammate of Tennoji's, to the gifted but lone wolf Seiichiro Sakaki. Despite the roster's potential, the club has struggled against elite competition. As a complete futsal novice, Yamato has his work cut out for him as well. Together with his newfound friends, he sets out to transform Koyo into a futsal powerhouse.",
