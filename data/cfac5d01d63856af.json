  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A young girl is given a simple yet important mission - to water a radish plant. However, this task proves more difficult than expected as she faces a nonstop onslaught of pop culture characters ranging from menacing monsters to spaceships and robots. Undaunted, the resourceful heroine fends off her many foes with skill and determination, all while protecting her precious cup of water needed to nourish the radish. In a follow-up adventure, the same spunky girl, now clad in a playful bunny costume, takes on new intergalactic challengers. Wielding sci-fi weapons like lightsabers, she battles through waves of stormtroopers and other familiar faces from beloved franchises. Set to a rocking 80's soundtrack, this animated odyssey pays tribute to countless touchstones of science fiction fandom. Created by ambitious anime fans, these Daicon animated shorts burst with loving references to geeky pop culture. Their frenetic energy captures the rush of imagination that fuels fandom. Though originally made on a shoestring budget, these tributes to sci-fi dreaming spawned a professional animation studio and influenced an entire generation.",
