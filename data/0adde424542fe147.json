  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 1999, humanity has expanded beyond the solar system, coming into conflict with the planet Gishin ruled by Emperor Zule. Seeking to eliminate Earth as a threat, Zule sends an infant named Mars to infiltrate humanity. Accompanying Mars is a giant robot called Gaia powered by an explosive energy source capable of annihilating planets. Mars is adopted on Earth by a Japanese family and named Takeru. Now 17, Takeru refuses orders from Zule to detonate Gaia's planet-killing bomb, having grown to love his adoptive homeworld. However, if Takeru dies, the bomb will automatically detonate. Possessing psychic abilities, Takeru joins an elite defense force called the Crashers to protect Earth from the Gishin invasion led by his brother Maag. Unknown to the Gishin, Takeru's father created five additional robots - Sphinx, Uranus, Titan, Shin and Ra - programmed to protect Takeru. By combining with Gaia, these robots form the gigantic mecha Godmars, awakened whenever Takeru summons it to defend humanity.",
