    "text": "Haruto is a high school student who has been in love with his childhood friend Hime for years. When Hime reveals she is actually Princess Crystal from a parallel fantasy world, and must return to marry a prince, Haruto impulsively follows her back through the dimensional portal. Crashing the wedding, Haruto ends up accidentally married to Hime after she kisses him, granting him magical powers. According to prophecy, as Hime's husband Haruto is now destined to become the Ring King, a great hero who can save the world from the evil Abyss King. But first he must gain the power of four other magical princesses by marrying them too. Though overwhelmed, the responsibility of being the world's savior now falls to Haruto. With Hime by his side, he must rise to the challenge and gather the strength needed to confront the Abyss King, whose resurrection threatens them all. It's a daunting task for any high school student, but the fate of two worlds hangs in the balance.",
