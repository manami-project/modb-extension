    "text": "The Yuzuki brothers - Hayato, Mikoto, Minato, and Gakuto - form an unbreakable bond as they navigate life after the untimely passing of their parents. Hayato, the eldest at 23, shoulders the responsibility of caring for his siblings while working as a teacher. Mikoto and Minato, although not twins, share a school year and vastly different personalities; Mikoto's calm demeanor and responsibility contrast with Minato's impulsiveness and energy. Gakuto, the youngest, possesses wisdom beyond his elementary school years. Together, they experience the highs and lows of everyday life, from school to home, facing challenges and triumphs as a family. Witness the Yuzuki brothers laugh, cry, and support each other in this heartwarming tale of brotherhood and resilience.",
