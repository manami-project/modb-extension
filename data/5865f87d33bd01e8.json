    "text": "Jr.'s partnership faces an unexpected shake-up as Apollon Media welcomes a new corporate leader, Mark Schneider. Schneider's first order of business: dismissing Kotetsu T. Kaburagi, also known as Wild Tiger, and reassigning Barnaby Brooks Jr. to the First League alongside Golden Ryan, a powerful new hero with an ego as massive as his abilities.\n\nAs the city prepares for the 'Justice Day' festival to honor Sternbild's revered goddess, a sequence of peculiar events begins to unfold, eerily mirroring an ancient curse. Tasked with investigating these strange occurrences, the heroes uncover a sinister plot orchestrated by three formidable NEXTs, who aim to wreak havoc and destruction upon Stern Bild.\n\nWith the festival's day of celebration at risk and the city's safety hanging in the balance, the heroes must rise to the challenge and unravel the mystery surrounding the goddess legend. Will they succeed in thwarting the impending chaos, or will the dark forces prevail? Only time will tell in this thrilling anime adventure.",
