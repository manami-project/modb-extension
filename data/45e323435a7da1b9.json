  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Washio Sumi wa Yuusha de Aru takes place two years before the events of Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru and focuses on a group of middle school girls who are chosen to become heroes. Specifically, the story follows Sumi Washio and her friends Sonoko Nogi and Gin Minowa, sixth grade students tasked with fighting mysterious enemies called Vertex that are attacking Shinju-sama, the god tree protecting their world. Though they embrace their duty to protect others, the girls are unaware of the immense personal cost this battle will eventually exact. Over the course of their efforts, they strive to cherish the precious normalcy of school life with friends even as the dangers they face intensify. Sumi's tale sets the stage for the experiences of Yuuki Yuuna, the hero explored in the original anime. The prequel content is adapted from the Washio Sumi light novels and is first released theatrically as a movie trilogy. It is then included as the opening story arc in Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou, the second season of the Yuuki Yuuna anime series.",
