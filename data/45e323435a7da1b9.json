  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Takahiro's light novel series, \"Washio Sumi wa Yuusha de Aru,\" illustrated by Bunbun, serves as the basis for an anime set in the divine era's 298th year. The narrative centers around three elementary school girls: Washio Sumi, Nogi Sonoko, and Minowa Gin. These young heroes are entrusted with a mission of critical importance: to protect Shikoku, the world's last inhabitable region, and its divine guardian, Shinju-sama, from the enigmatic enemy, Vertex. Little do they know, the battle ahead will demand more of them than they ever thought possible.\n\nThis anime serves as a prequel to \"Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru,\" and it comprises the first six episodes of its sequel, \"Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru: Yuusha no Shou.\" Before airing on television, these episodes were screened in theaters as a trilogy of movies.\n\nTwo years prior to the events of \"Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero,\" we find Sumi Washio, a 6th grader, who has been chosen by Shinjyu to save the world. Balancing her heroic duties with her everyday life, Sumi cherishes her time with classmates Sonoko Nogi and Gin Minowa. As the story progresses from Sumi Washio to Yuuki Yuuna, an unexpected incident disrupts the tranquility of the Sanshu Middle School Hero Club's ordinary life.",
