    "text": "Kotetsu, Yui, and Akira are young explorers known as Gene Divers, embarking on thrilling virtual expeditions to gather DNA samples from extinct animals in a laboratory called Virtual Station. The ancient world is meticulously reconstructed using advanced technology, allowing the Gene Divers to delve into the depths of prehistory.\n\nOne fateful day, Yui stumbles upon an injured baby creature and, with Akira's assistance, decides to help it. However, their well-intentioned actions trigger an unexpected system malfunction. As Yui attempts to leave the virtual world during maintenance, she finds herself transported to a new virtual present instead of returning to reality.\n\nIn this uncontrolled digital realm, a cunning and intelligent species of rodents called Puglaistig has evolved. Perceiving humans as a significant threat, the Puglaistig are determined to halt human evolution by any means necessary. Now, it's up to Yui, Akira, and Kotetsu to thwart the Puglaistig's sinister plans and safeguard the future of humanity in this enthralling blend of anime and live-action adventure.",
