    "text": "This poignant anime explores the bittersweet parting between a young boy and his pet fish. One day, the fish expresses a longing to leave its tank and see the ocean. Though reluctant, the boy promises to grant its wish. As they journey to the sea, the boy reminisces on their time together, while the fish dreams excitedly of its new life ahead. Their recollections reveal a disconnect - the boy focused on the companionship, the fish on escaping confinement. Yet both grapple with complex emotions over their impending separation. Created while a student at Tokyo University of the Arts, this anime deftly examines the tension between freedom and attachment through a deceptively simple premise. With sensitivity and symbolism, it speaks to the difficult goodbyes we all must face as loved ones change and grow. More than a quirky fish-out-of-water tale, this film promises emotional resonance alongside visual artistry.",
