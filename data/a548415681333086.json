  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This abstract anime explores the imagination and how it manifests from everyday life. It shows that the mundane scenes we encounter can spark fantastical thoughts and daydreams within our minds. Over time, these fleeting visions accumulate into an elaborate inner world of reverie and creativity. The animation was created in 2015 by first-year graduate students at the prestigious Tokyo University of the Arts. It was produced within the Department of Animation's Graduate School of Film and New Media. The team who brought this innovative concept to life includes director Kaori Ryo, music composer Chika Watanabe, sound designer Sachi Takahashi, and producer Mitsuko Okamoto. Through artistic visuals, this anime provides a window into the boundless human imagination. It reveals how even routine moments can inspire flights of fancy. The creators have woven the ordinary and the extraordinary into a unique viewing experience that encourages us to embrace our own inner creativity.",
