    "text": "Touya Mochizuki's life is cut short when he is accidentally struck by lightning from God. As an apology, God offers to revive Touya by reincarnating him in a magical fantasy world, granting him one wish in the process. Touya asks to keep his smartphone with him in this new world. Now revived, Touya sets out on adventures in a land filled with magic, secrets, and new companions. He quickly befriends figures of importance, including several girls who compete for his romantic attention. Touya also inherits ancient powers on par with the world's kings. Through it all, Touya relies on his modern smartphone to help navigate this realm of swords and sorcery. Though killed once by happenstance, Touya now leads a charmed second life. His days are filled with laughter, mystery, and the wonders of a fantasy world viewed through a smartphone screen.",
