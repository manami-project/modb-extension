  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Cedar Hill's legendary Stony Cat statue is said to grant unique wishes, taking an unwanted trait from one person and passing it on to another in need. Youto Yokodera, a high school student with a secretly perverted mind, prays to the statue to reveal his true self to the world, rather than the misinterpreted kind persona everyone sees. At the same time, Tsukiko Tsutsukakushi, a classmate of Youto's, wishes to hide her emotions and become more mature.\n\nTheir wishes are granted, but not in the way they expected. Youto's unfiltered lewd thoughts now slip out uncontrollably, earning him the nickname \"Pervert Prince,\" while Tsukiko finds herself unable to express any emotions at all. In a twist of fate, Youto's old facade is transferred to Azusa, the admired school idol.\n\nWith their lives turned upside down, Youto and Tsukiko form an unlikely alliance to find a way to reverse the Stony Cat's powers. As they search for a solution, the trio - Youto, Tsukiko, and Azusa - develop an unexpected bond, navigating the complexities of their newfound selves and learning valuable lessons about honesty, acceptance, and the consequences of their desires.",
