    "text": "Upon celebrating the 25th anniversary of the series and the 40th anniversary of its mangaka, a CG anime brings back the timeless tale of Saint Seiya: Legend of Sanctuary. Since time immemorial, warriors known as Saints have safeguarded the Goddess Athena. When evil resurfaces, these Saints are destined to emerge. A young woman named Saori Kido discovers that she is the embodiment of Athena, the guardian of love and peace on Earth, and wields a force called 'Cosmos'. However, the Pope of the Sanctuary, the one who commands all the Saints, harbors ill intentions towards Saori and dispatches an assassin to eliminate her. In her time of need, one of the Bronze Saints, Seiya, comes to her rescue. As the story unfolds, Saori learns of her true identity and sets out to confront the Pope. Seiya, along with fellow Bronze Saints Hyouga, Shiryuu, Shun, and Ikki, must navigate through the twelve Zodiac Temples within Athena's Sanctuary in a race against time to save their goddess from certain doom. To reach the cure that will save Athena, they must face off against each of the twelve Gold Saints guarding the temples. Will Seiya and his fellow Saints succeed in their mission to protect Saori and Athena in this thrilling saga?",
