    "text": "After being crowned the Battle Bladers champion, Gingka finds himself targeted by bladers across the world seeking to defeat the new top Beyblader. This popularity sparks the WBBA, now led by Ryo Hagane, to announce a global Beyblade World Championship tournament. Countries begin assembling their best teams to compete on the international stage. For Japan's national team, old friends and rivals - including Tsubasa, Kyoya, Benkei, and Yu - battle intensely to secure a coveted representative spot. Gingka is selected to represent Japan, joined by the brash and fiery new blader Masamune Kadoya as his tag-team partner. However, Masamune soon makes it clear he also sees Gingka as a rival to overcome en route to being crowned the world's best. As the World Championships kick off, the Japanese team finds itself up against world-class competition. Rivals like Team Wild Fang and dangerous new foes like Faust emerge as threats to Japan's championship aspirations. To have any chance at victory, Gingka and his teammates must work together, using brand new Beyblade techniques and technologies while also overcoming internal divisions. The stage is set for dramatic showdowns and shocking revelations that will redefine the sport of Beyblading forever.",
