  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two years have passed since Yumemi, a young girl with the power to see the celestial world above, helped Munto, the ruler of the magical kingdom, prevent a catastrophic event known as the 'Continent's Dropping'. Now, as she navigates the trials of middle school, the heavenly world is on the brink of destruction once more. The kings of the celestial realm, having regained their divine powers, have turned against each other, plunging the heavens into chaos and war.\n\nAs the conflict threatens to spill into the human world, Munto is sent back to Earth to seek Yumemi's aid once again. However, Munto hesitates to contact her, even as the kings prepare to attack his magical realm. Meanwhile, the cunning Guntarl plots to capture Yumemi for his own nefarious purposes.\n\nDespite the mounting pressures of school and the incomprehensible decision she must make, Yumemi remains resolute. With her friends Ichiko and Suzume by her side, she must find a way to transcend the boundaries of space and time to reach Munto and save both their worlds from impending doom. As the destruction of the two realms looms ever closer, only Yumemi, the unassuming 'Girl of Destiny', can restore balance to the heavens and the earth.",
