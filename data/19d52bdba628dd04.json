  "synopsis": {
    "text": "On the lush green Southern Cross Isle off the coast of Japan, an organization named the Glittering Crux Brigade frequently gathers to plot unlocking the power of ancient giants called Cybodies. These stone warriors lie dormant deep underground, only able to transform in Zero Time. The Crux hopes that by breaking the seals of the island's four shrine maidens, they can utilize the Cybodies' strength freely. One fateful night, a youth named Takuto Tsunashi washes up on Southern Cross's shores and is rescued by Sugata Shindou and fianc√©e Wako Agemaki. After awakening, Takuto enrolls at the local academy, quickly befriending his rescuers. However, many students secretly belong to the Glittering Crux, seeking to eventually shatter Wako's seal. Yet Takuto holds his own secret - in Zero Time, he can control a powerful Cybody named Tauburn. A gifted 'Star Driver,' he will prove the key to stopping the Crux's ambitions and protecting both the island and his newfound friends. In the coming battles, this Galactic Pretty Boy will have to dig deep to prevent tragedy from tearing the island apart.",
