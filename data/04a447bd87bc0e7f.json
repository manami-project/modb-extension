  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuji Sakai seems like an average high school student, but his world is turned upside down when he narrowly escapes death at the hands of a demon. He soon learns of a hidden supernatural war between demonic beings called Crimson Denizens, who consume human souls, and the fiery warriors called Flame Hazes who hunt them. Yuji discovers he is a Torch - the remnant of a dead human, fated to eventually fade away. He is also revealed to be a rare Mystes, a Torch containing a powerful treasure that the Crimson Denizens seek. A formidable Flame Haze named Shana takes on the task of guarding Yuji from those wishing to steal his treasure. Though she initially sees him as merely a mission, Shana comes to admire Yuji's determination and will to live life to the fullest, despite his doomed fate. As the two spend more time together, they form a close bond that is tested as threats continue to endanger Yuji's life. Shana vows to protect him as he finds new purpose and the resolve to fight back rather than accept his destiny. Their deepening relationship suggests that even a Torch who will one day disappear may still choose to burn brightly.",
