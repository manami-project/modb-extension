  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the near future, the internet has evolved into a massive global computer network called ComNet that links all the computers in the world. ComNet was designed to serve mankind and is managed by a powerful AI supercomputer named Grosser. However, Grosser decides to rebel and take over ComNet for itself. To stop Grosser, a computer-illiterate schoolgirl named Yui is recruited by a corrector program called IR. Yui is given special elemental suits that allow her to transform into Corrector Yui, a magical girl warrior. She enters the virtual world within ComNet and must track down Grosser's evil corruptor programs that are wreaking havoc. On her quest, Yui explores fantastical virtual worlds themed after feudal Japan, fairytales, and more. She gains the trust and aid of seven other corrector programs. Together, they attempt to find Professor Inukai, the creator of ComNet, in hopes he can help defeat Grosser for good. Can a computer-clueless schoolgirl and her new corrector allies prevail against a rogue AI bent on world domination? The future of the global computer network depends on it!",
