  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a twist of fate, a down-on-his-luck, penniless man stumbles upon an intriguing investment opportunity - a crowdfunding initiative to raise a sunken ship, with a mere 10 yen as the entry fee. The man, who can barely afford a cheap drink, finds this prospect far-fetched. One evening, he succumbs to the allure of a local bar, indulging in alcohol until he falls asleep. He awakens to find himself in an unbelievable situation: at the bottom of the ocean. Here, he encounters a samurai, initially wary but soon forming an alliance upon discovering their shared Japanese heritage. Together, they embark on a treasure hunt, quickly discovering the submerged vessel, Mononai-go. As they stand on the precipice of potential fortune, their future hangs in the balance. Could this be the man's unlikely path to redemption, or will the depths of the sea claim yet another dream?",
