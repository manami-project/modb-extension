  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Isle of Marcleida, a land shrouded in mystery and terror, becomes the battleground for young warrior Tia Allbright and her clumsy sidekick Luke. Armed with her spirit-infused sword Grandeek, Tia is on a mission to put an end to the island's gruesome murders. However, gaining entry to the island proves challenging, as Tia and Luke are initially turned away.\n\nDetermined to fulfill her quest, Tia seeks a way past the heavily guarded fences, while another enigmatic stranger arrives on the island, also in search of something. The root of the island's troubles lies with the legendary sword Aihorn, now in the wrong hands after being stolen. The spirit residing within Aihorn yearns for vengeance, targeting those responsible for its master's death half a century ago.\n\nAs Tia infiltrates the island, it becomes apparent that both she and the stranger share a common goal: to retrieve Aihorn and stop its bloodthirsty rampage. However, the sword's power to possess its wielder puts them at a significant disadvantage.\n\nIn this thrilling tale of swords and sorcery, Tia and Grandeek must face their most formidable challenge yet. Inspired by Kohime Ohse's manga, the stage is set for an epic confrontation between Tia, the stranger, and the vengeful spirit of Aihorn.",
