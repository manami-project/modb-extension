  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2307 AD, humanity faces an energy crisis as fossil fuels have become completely depleted. As a solution, three massive solar power generation systems are constructed in orbit around the Earth, each managed by one of three major power blocs: the Union centered around North America, the Human Reform League centered around Asia, and the AEU centered around Europe. However, the benefits of this new energy system are not equally distributed, leading to resentment from excluded nations. Global conflict continues to ravage the world. Amidst this endless warfare, a mysterious paramilitary organization called Celestial Being emerges. Armed with advanced mobile suits called Gundams, they intervene in wars around the world with the stated goal of eradicating conflict and uniting humanity. Their actions quickly divide public opinion as governments oppose the threat to their sovereignty. The story follows Celestial Being's Gundam pilots - Setsuna, Lockon, Allelujah and Tieria - as they fight to achieve their mission for peace while the world's superpowers ally against them. Their ideological battle triggers a chain of events that will determine the future course of human history. Will humanity finally unite to end warfare, or plunge further into devastating conflict?",
