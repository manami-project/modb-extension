  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Daichi Kakeru, a 16-year-old high school student with no prior romantic experience, finds his mundane life turned upside down when a seemingly ordinary melon soda can transforms into a captivating human girl, Melon, upon contact with his lips. As if this wasn't perplexing enough, more girls materialize from various beverage cans, each requiring carbon dioxide infusion from kissing to sustain their existence. Unbeknownst to Kakeru, these occurrences are part of a clandestine government project involving 'Akikans' - aluminum and steel cans that morph into human form.\n\nAs Melon's newfound owner, Kakeru names her and permits her to stay despite his initial reluctance to accept her presence. However, the government project mandates that these Akikans engage in battles to determine the superior can material. With the emergence of Budoko, a grape juice Akikan, and Yell, a sports-drink Akikan, Kakeru and Melon find themselves drawn into a conflict they wish to avoid. Will they manage to elude the impending battles, or will they be forced to participate in this extraordinary war of cans?",
