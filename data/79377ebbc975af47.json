    "text": "Mad ness and mayhem reign supreme in the once peaceful city of Yokohama, now a haven for ruthless biker gangs. Amidst this chaos, the 'Crazy Babies' stand tall, led by the fearless 17-year-old Hiromi Katayama, a formidable fighter known for his unwavering moral compass. As Katayama navigates the tumultuous waters of maintaining peace in Yokohama and managing his affection for his motorcycling classmate, Asami, he faces unexpected challenges.\n\nIn an attempt to strengthen his team and explore his romantic interests, Katayama proposes a month-long truce, much to the disdain of his Tokyo nemesis, the Mad Emperor. Meanwhile, the fiery ambition of a new recruit, Toshi Ikeda, inadvertently ignites a feud with the menacing Nagoya-based gang, The Dragon Star Crew, who have their sights set on conquering the entire Kanto region. With the stakes higher than ever, can Katayama protect Yokohama from the looming threat and uphold the ideals of the Crazy Babies? Experience this thrilling, slightly comedic bousouzoku anime that echoes the spirit of Bomber Bikers of Shonan.",
