  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Usagi Kuro of Itsuka Tenma, the beloved anime, presents a special OVA episode in collaboration with the ninth volume of its novel. This episode, penned by the author Kagami Takaya, brings three captivating short stories to life. Two of these stories are born from the creative minds of fans who shared their ideas on social media, while the third is an exciting crossover with another of Kagami's acclaimed works, The Legend of the Legendary Heroes.\n\nThe OVA episode kicks off with Mirai, who wakes up from a nap with a parched throat. When Gekkō denies her request for a drink, she spots an unusual potion on the table and, ignoring Yūichi's previous warning, gulps it down. Little does she know, the potion initiates a soul-swapping frenzy, causing the main characters to spend their day unintentionally switching bodies due to Mirai's impulsive action.\n\nJoin the Itsu-Ten cast as they navigate through body-swapping chaos, chibi-style dreams, and an enthralling crossover with Densetsu no Yuusha no Densetsu in this must-watch OVA episode!",
