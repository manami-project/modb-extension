  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based on the provided information, this anime contains several short stories focused around a main cast of characters. One story follows Mirai after she accidentally drinks a mysterious potion that causes body-swapping whenever the drinker touches someone. This results in the main characters randomly trading bodies throughout the day. Another story relates Mirai's silly dream told in a cutesy art style. Additionally, there is a crossover episode with the fantasy anime The Legend of the Legendary Heroes, suggesting these stories take place in a fantasy setting with magic. While the exact plot remains unclear, these various tales promise lighthearted fun and magical hijinks with a group of friends. With ideas stemming directly from the original author and fan input, this collection of shorts aspires to provide extra enjoyment for existing fans while potentially attracting new viewers.",
