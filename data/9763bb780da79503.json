  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Lupin III's iconic style graced the silver screen in an unexpected way when Jackie Chan's 1979 martial arts comedy, The Fearless Hyena, made its Japanese debut in 1980 under the title Crazy Monkey. To commemorate the film's release, a delightful animated short was created by the renowned Toei Animation, using character designs by the legendary Monkey Punch, the mastermind behind Lupin III. Set to the catchy insert song Monkey Man, this unique animated piece featured characters bearing a striking resemblance to the beloved Lupin Sansei cast, making for an exciting and unforgettable fusion of live-action and animation.",
