  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's a new beginning for Rika and her friends as they strive to heal from the traumatic events that once plagued Hinamizawa. But just as life starts to regain its normal rhythm, Rika is thrust back into a whirlwind of tragedy following an unexpected accident. She awakens to find herself in a summer of 1983 that is eerily different from the one she remembers. Determined to break free from the vicious cycle of bloodshed that has held the town captive, Rika embarks on a mission to set things right. However, she soon realizes that the task is far more complex than she initially thought. As she navigates this new reality, Rika grapples with the question of whether she can abandon this seemingly perfect world she's been given a chance to live in, or if she should fight to return to the world she once knew.",
