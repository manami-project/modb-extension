  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This short film is a creative collaboration between the popular mobile RPG game Brave Frontier and the animated Himitsukessha Taka no Tsume franchise. It opens with an animated version of Brave Frontier's director Eiji Takahashi humorously mimicking the Taka no Tsume NEO trailer announcement. We then learn that Takahashi will be directing an ambitious crossover film mashing up the Taka no Tsume universe with DC Comics superheroes. This groundbreaking project aims to provide mutual benefits for fans of both franchises - Brave Frontier players can get discounted movie tickets, while Taka no Tsume viewers will see film characters appear in the mobile game. The short even features a lively animated version of Kaoringo, an actual Brave Frontier PR staff member. One perk for fans is special early access to film screenings where Kaoringo herself provides an introduction. Blending real personalities with creative cross-media promotions, this quirky collaboration promises an irreverent and entertaining experience for fans.",
