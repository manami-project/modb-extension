    "text": "Martial arts prodigy Layfon Alseif seeks a fresh start in the Academy City of Zuellni, one of the few remaining sanctuaries for humanity in a post-apocalyptic world ravaged by monstrous creatures called Filth Monsters. In this new haven, mobile cities known as Regios provide refuge, with Zuellni being a unique, conscious city guided by electronic fairies.\n\nAs Layfon settles into his new life, he draws the attention of Nina Antalk, the ambitious leader of the 17th Military Arts Platoon. Recognizing his extraordinary talents, she is determined to recruit him for her team. But Layfon's mysterious past and extraordinary abilities are not easily forgotten, and his presence in Zuellni may bring unforeseen challenges to both him and his new comrades.\n\nWith the ever-looming threat of Filth Monsters and the complexities of inter-platoon rivalries, Layfon's journey in Zuellni promises to be anything but ordinary. As he navigates this new world, he must confront the shadows of his past and embrace his destiny as a powerful Heavens-Blade wielder.",
