  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san is a lighthearted anime that follows the quirky relationship between two high school girls with contrasting personalities. Yachiyo Inugami is an energetic, masochistic cat-lover with a dog-like personality. Suzu Nekoyama is a shy, timid dog-lover with a cat-like personality. After a fateful first meeting, Inugami finds herself strangely attracted to the bashful Nekoyama. She begins instinctively trying to get close to Nekoyama, who reacts with embarrassment. Their friend Aki observes their antics with amusement, often poking fun at the unlikely pair. She also has to rein in some of Inugami's wilder behavior. As Inugami and Nekoyama spend more time together, they slowly begin to understand each other. With its wacky characters, humor, and an opposites-attract romance, Inugami-san to Nekoyama-san promises laughs as it explores the growing relationship between two very different high school girls.",
