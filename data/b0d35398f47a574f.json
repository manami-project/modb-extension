    "text": "Souhei's life takes a dramatic turn when the conflict between the Duchy of Krakozhia and the Republic of Grania pulls him into its vortex, all thanks to his father's unexpected role as the Duchy's military leader. To shield him from the Republic's wrath, two female bodyguards, First Lieutenant Lutgalnikov and Second Lieutenant Haruka, storm into his life with their unconventional methods of protection. Lutgalnikov's zealous dedication to her duty results in Souhei's home becoming a battlefield, while Haruka's grudge against him, sparked by an embarrassing first encounter, leads to her relentless pursuit of erasing his memory using explosives. As if this chaos wasn't enough, a lazy assassin from the Republic, Shachirof Gunsou, decides to ship herself to Souhei's doorstep to finish him off. Will Souhei survive this whirlwind of gunfire and grenades in his once-peaceful life?",
