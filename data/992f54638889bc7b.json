  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around Rakuga, a magical kingdom floating high in the sky that derives its energy from children's drawings and doodles. However, due to modern technology like tablets and TVs, fewer children are drawing, causing Rakuga's energy supply to dwindle dangerously. To save their kingdom from collapse, Rakuga's military travels to Earth to force children to draw more. Meanwhile, Princess Rakuga searches for a peaceful solution, hoping to find a hero on Earth who can wield the powerful \"Miracle Crayon\" whose drawings become real objects. The crayon ends up with young Shin-chan. Although an unlikely hero, he uses the crayon to draw himself some allies. Together, this ragtag group strives to restore children's creativity and save both Earth and Rakuga from disaster through the power of imagination. Despite the stakes, their hilarious and chaotic antics put their success in question.",
