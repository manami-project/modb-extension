  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shonen Jack has given the green light for Moritaka and Akito's manga to be serialized, marking the beginning of their professional journey in the manga industry. As they bid farewell to their previous editor, Hattori, they are introduced to their new manager, Gorou Miura, who, despite his occasional rudeness, is not inherently malicious. Although initially skeptical, the duo soon adapt to their new working environment, thanks to the assistance of an experienced assistant named Ogawa and a team of three additional assistants.\n\nAs the new year rolls in, Moritaka and Akito attend Shonen Jack's New Year Party, where they encounter Hiramaru Kazuya, a prodigious manga artist of an entirely different caliber than Eiji. The stakes are high, and the competition is fierce as they strive to keep their manga atop the reader polls to prevent cancellation. With the pressure mounting, Moritaka and Akito must not only meet the demands of their discerning audience but also outshine their fellow manga artists in order to achieve their ultimate dream of seeing their story adapted into an anime.",
