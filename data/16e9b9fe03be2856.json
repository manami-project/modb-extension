  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ichinomiya Shingo is a 25-year-old office worker who lives a normal, stressful life. One evening after work, he goes to sleep and awakens to find himself in the body of Wendelin Von Benno Baumeister, the 8-year-old son of an impoverished noble family. Through Wendelin's memories, Shingo learns that the Baumeister family possesses extensive lands in the countryside but lacks the administrative skills to properly govern them. Though born into poverty, Wendelin has been blessed with a rare and powerful talent for magic. While this gift presents opportunity, in Wendelin's situation it has so far only brought misfortune. Now inhabiting Wendelin’s body and mind, Shingo is determined to use his knowledge from his previous life along with Wendelin’s magical abilities to improve the family’s financial and social standing. However, escaping the shackles of an aristocratic society that frowns upon magical commoners proves challenging. This is the story of a young man striving to forge his own path in a harsh world with no legendary deeds of world-saving on his agenda - just freedom, respect, and a purpose.",
