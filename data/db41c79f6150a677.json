  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This avant-garde anime explores the complex nature of romantic relationships through an absurd yet thought-provoking premise. It centers around a desperate woman relentlessly pursuing a reluctant man across various surreal landscapes while repeatedly professing her love. Though her aggressive tactics like chaining him up fail, she persists in her attempts to win his affection. With its minimalist animation and dialogue, the anime offers a biting commentary on the darker sides of obsession and codependency. The endless chase also symbolizes the futility of forcing a connection rather than fostering mutual understanding. While the meaning is left ambiguous, the viewer is sure to find this work by renowned animator Yoji Kuri both unsettling and profound. Evoking themes of miscommunication, unrequited love, and the blurred lines between affection and coercion, this experimental short provides a unique perspective on romance in a strikingly raw form. Its imagery and message continue to resonate decades after its 1963 release.",
