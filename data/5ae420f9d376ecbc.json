    "text": "Unknown adversaries from another dimension have been waging war against humanity for decades, prompting the cryogenic preservation of children to safeguard their lives. Upon awakening, these children discover they have developed extraordinary abilities known as 'Worlds.' To protect their homeland from the Unknown entities emerging from Tokyo Bay, these young warriors establish defensive strongholds in Tokyo, Kanagawa, and Chiba.\n\nAs leaders of these fortified cities, childhood friends Ichiya Suzaku and Canaria Utara, siblings Kasumi and Asuha Chigusa, and the duo of Maihime Tenkawa and Hotaru Rindou, must unite their unique powers to defend against the relentless Unknown attacks. However, clashing personalities and petty rivalries often lead to disagreements among the city heads.\n\nWith the Unknown forces escalating their assaults, the leaders must put aside their differences and collaborate to maintain humanity's last line of defense against the brink of extinction.",
