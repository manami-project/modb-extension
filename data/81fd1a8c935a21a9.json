As the head of the Model Club, she leads a trio of schoolgirls in constructing intricate plastic models, ranging from automobiles and boats to robots.

From internal squabbles to impromptu lessons on love confessions, these three friends find themselves entangled in a series of absurd and hilarious predicaments that promise to keep viewers entertained.",
