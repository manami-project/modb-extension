    "text": "Earth, 26th century: the era of interstellar exploration and discovery. Among the curious minds is Shana T, a dedicated reporter for a television station, with a keen interest in alien civilizations and their languages. Her latest assignment takes her to the distant planet GO/7498/2, aboard the cargo-spaceship Lydia, captained by the initially reluctant but eventually amiable Harmer.\n\nTheir mission? To document the remnants of an extraterrestrial civilization. The planet is home to a dark-skinned, golden-eyed humanoid race that leads a seemingly carefree existence. However, the researchers unwittingly disrupt the natural equilibrium, revealing a dangerous symbiosis between these beings and a menacing reptilian parasite.\n\nAs the team delves deeper into the alien world, Shana's fascination with extraterrestrial languages could prove vital. Meanwhile, a mysterious foundation, advocating for 'friendly contact with aliens,' conducts clandestine excavations, secretly capturing an alien in the process. The stage is set for a thrilling exploration of courage, curiosity, and the consequences of meddling with forces beyond our understanding.",
