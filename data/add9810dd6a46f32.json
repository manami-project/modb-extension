    "text": "Christmas is just around the corner, and with it comes a unique opportunity: a rumor circulating suggests that any love confession made on this special millennial eve will grant one's deepest wish. Keitaro, a retaker of preliminary tests, faces a dilemma as he must balance his studies and his desire to confess his love to Naru. However, Keitaro is not the only one with romantic intentions this Christmas Eve, as others too plan to reveal their feelings.\n\nAs the festive atmosphere intensifies, so does the pressure on Keitaro, Naru, and Mutsumi to pass their exams. Keitaro, driven by the rumor, musters the courage to confess his love to Naru, but his nervousness leads to an unexpected outcome, leaving him questioning if his love is unrequited.\n\nMeanwhile, young Shinobu Maehara has her own confession to make to her beloved Urashima-senpai, and Mutsumi carries a secret confession of her own. Amidst the chaos, a mysterious letter accompanying Naru's Christmas present adds to the confusion, sparking a dramatic race against time.\n\nThis TV special unfolds shortly after the end of the TV series, offering a whirlwind of emotions, love confessions, and a touch of suspense, all wrapped up in the spirit of Christmas.",
