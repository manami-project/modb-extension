  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows a group of high school girls who participate in the sport of sensha-dō, or \"tankery\", where teams operate tanks in mock battles. After the events depicted in the Girls und Panzer der Film movie, several special episodes were released along with the film's home video editions to provide additional content. One special episode, Arisu War!, picks up the story after the conclusion of the movie. It offers fans a glimpse into the characters' lives post-competition as they partake in new sensha-dō adventures. Additional supplemental episodes also act as informative corner pieces that provide background details on the tanks and strategies involved in the sport. Though brief in length, these specials allow devoted viewers more time with beloved characters and the unique sensha-dō setting. With a blend of action and education, they underscore the franchise's commitment to offering audiences more of the tankery excitement that has captured their interests.",
