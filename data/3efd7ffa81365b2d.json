  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After death, certain souls arrive at a mysterious bar called Quindecim instead of heaven or hell. Quindecim is attended by Decim, a stoic bartender tasked with judging these souls. To determine if a soul will reincarnate or be sent into oblivion, Decim makes them compete against each other in deadly games which reveal their true natures. Initially emotionless in his judgments, Decim's methods are shaken when a mysterious black-haired woman with amnesia arrives at the bar. As she participates in the games, Decim begins questioning his own rulings and whether he is truly fit to decide souls' fates. At Quindecim, the stakes are life and death. Patrons bet their souls on simple bar games laced with sadistic twists, dancing to the whims of Decim while struggling to regain their lost memories. In this ghastly parade of death and memories, Decim doles out judgment - but even he is not immune to doubt.",
