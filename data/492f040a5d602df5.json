    "text": "Suit up for a gripping journey in the Cosmic Era (C.E.), a time when genetically enhanced beings called Coordinators and naturally born humans, Naturals, coexist uneasily. Their ideological conflict erupts into a full-scale war, threatening the very existence of both factions. Amidst this chaos, the Destiny Plan emerges, aiming to impose predetermined roles on individuals to eliminate competition. However, the plan is ultimately rejected to preserve humanity's freedom and aspirations.\n\nFast forward to C.E.75, the battle lines remain drawn, with independence movements and Blue Cosmos aggression intensifying. In response, the World Peace Supervision Organization, COMPASS, is established under the leadership of Lacus Clyne. Kira Yamato and his team join COMPASS, intervening in various skirmishes to maintain peace. As tensions escalate, an emerging nation, FOUNDATION, proposes a joint operation to strike at the heart of Blue Cosmos' stronghold. Will destiny prevail, or will Kira and his team defy the odds to resist it? Join them in this thrilling new Gundam SEED movie, part of the 'Mobile Suit Gundam SEED PROJECT Ignited,' celebrating Gundam SEED's 20th anniversary in 2022.",
