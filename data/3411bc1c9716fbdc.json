  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fighters of the Z-team have resumed their peaceful lives seven years after vanquishing Cell, with Goku honing his skills in the Other World, Krillin tying the knot, and Gohan grappling with high school. However, the upcoming World Martial Arts Tournament promises to bring them together once more to square off against Earth's mightiest combatants. Meanwhile, the nefarious sorcerer Babidi embarks on a cosmic mission to avenge his father and achieve universal conquest. To thwart Babidi's plans of awakening the formidable Majin Buu, the Supreme Kai seeks the Z-team's assistance. This remastered edition of the Majin Buu saga remains truer to the manga's narrative, boasting freshly recorded dialogue, sound effects, opening/closing sequences, and an all-new HD video transfer. This international version comprises 69 episodes, as opposed to the 61 released in Japan.",
