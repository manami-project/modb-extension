The story unfolds as we witness tender moments between the boy and his girlfriend, including a poignant farewell scene under a starlit sky as she prepares to move away with her family. Fast forward two years, the couple finds themselves reunited under the same celestial canopy, rekindling their shared love for stargazing.",
