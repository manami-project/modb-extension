  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Natsume Takashi is a young boy who has inherited the ability to see spirits from his late grandmother, Reiko. Along with his sarcastic spirit companion Madara, nicknamed Nyanko-sensei, Natsume seeks to return the names of spirits that were captured and bound by his grandmother, which are recorded in the Book of Friends. In his adventures, Natsume encounters a variety of spirits - some friendly, some hostile, and some simply in need of help. He learns that the connection between spirits and humans is complex, with resentment and prejudice on both sides. Still, through perseverance and compassion, bonds can form. As Natsume unravels the mystery of Reiko's life and reputation in the spirit world, he discovers insights about his own purpose and place between humans and spirits. With the Book of Friends in hand, perhaps Natsume can heal old wounds and bring reconciliation. However the path forward remains shrouded, demanding courage and faith from this boy who straddles two worlds.",
