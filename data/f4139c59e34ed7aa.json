    "text": "Earth becomes the stage for an extraordinary quest when the King of the Flower Planet, on his deathbed, requires the mythical Seven Color Flower to pass on his power to his successor. Lunlun, an ordinary girl from France, is thrust into this cosmic adventure on her 15th birthday when she encounters the talking animals, Nubo and Cato. As descendants of both humans and Flower Angels, Lunlun possesses a unique lineage that qualifies her to locate the elusive flower that embodies love and kindness.\n\nJoined by her newfound friends, the magical pin that channels the power of flowers, and an enigmatic photographer named Serge, Lunlun sets off on a journey that will reveal the virtues and vices of humans and Flower Angels alike. However, their mission is fraught with danger, as the ruthless Togenishia and her loyal servant Boris are determined to seize the flower for their own selfish desires.\n\nAs Lunlun navigates the trials and tribulations of her adventure, she forms a deep bond with Serge, who harbors a secret of his own. Guided by the wisdom of Cathy, the talking cat, and Wendel, the talking dog, Lunlun's epic odyssey unfolds, weaving a tale of love, growth, and the true meaning of power.",
