  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 7th century Tang dynasty China, imperial court general Huangfu Duanhua gets caught up in supernatural events after his friend accidentally enters the shop of a mysterious Persian merchant. This unleashes ancient secrets and intrigues kept hidden by the empire for a thousand years, sparking court disputes and strife within the royal family. As the wheels of history begin turning, where will they lead? In present-day Luoling City, an abnormal earthquake accidentally connects the human realm led by the Tianxuan sect with the alien realm. The two realms practice magic and are antagonistic towards each other. To prevent warfare from breaking out, aliens quietly do business in both realms while keeping the passageway on Chang'an Magic Street secret. When teenager Gu Shaoning befriends the aliens, his ordinary life is upended as he becomes entangled in the escalating tensions between the warring sects and races. Once set in motion, the winds of destiny can only push the youth onwards through a crucible of growth and tribulation.",
