    "text": "Hello Kitty and her adorable friends invite you to join their delightful adventures in the charming Stump Village! Nestled in a hidden corner of a lush forest, this unique community is made up of cozy tree stump homes. The village is home to a close-knit group of friends, including the mischievous Badtz Maru, the lovable Cinnamoroll, the sweet My Melody, the playful Pom Pom Purin, and, of course, the one and only Hello Kitty.\n\nIn this claymation series, each day brings new excitement and surprises. From creating a seesaw nutcracker and crafting vegetable sunglasses to constructing a scrumptious cookie town, there's always something fun happening. Although these friends occasionally have their disagreements, they never stay mad at each other for long. After all, the bonds of friendship are strong in Stump Village!\n\nWhile the focus remains on the main group of friends, you won't see many of the other Sanrio characters appearing frequently in this series. So get ready to immerse yourself in the delightful world of Hello Kitty and her pals, where every day is filled with laughter, friendship, and endless fun!",
