  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Thus begins the final chapter in the Captain Tsubasa saga, as Japan and Holland lock horns in a high-stakes exhibition match series. With the Japanese team reeling from consecutive defeats and their star player Hyuga sidelined by injury, the team's morale has hit rock bottom. In a last-ditch effort to turn the tide, the management reaches out to two of their most formidable players - Wakabayashi, who now resides in Germany, and Tsubasa, living in Brazil. However, both initially refuse the call.\n\nAs the third game commences, the Japanese team is struggling to keep up, but hope is not lost. In a dramatic turn of events, Tsubasa makes a surprise appearance in the second half, rejoining his team and reigniting their fighting spirit. With Tsubasa Ozora back at the helm, the team's confidence soars, and they go on to secure a resounding 11-1 victory over their Dutch opponents. Will this triumphant comeback be enough to bring Wakabayashi back into the fold? Only time will tell.",
