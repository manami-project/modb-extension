    "text": "Ever thought of a man becoming a billionaire by trying to lose money? Meet Pei Qian, the President of Tenda Group, a multi-billion dollar conglomerate spanning across games, internet, digital devices, cultural media, catering, and more. In an exclusive interview, Pei Qian confessed that his success wasn't due to business acumen but a stroke of luck.\n\nA decade ago, Pei Qian found himself in a parallel world with a peculiar system that rewarded him personally for every business loss. Eager to exploit this, he established Tenda Group, aiming to lose money through high-risk ventures in the gaming industry. His plan? Create games that defy market rules, expecting them to fail spectacularly.\n\nHowever, fate had a different plan. Pei Qian's 'alternative' games unexpectedly gained popularity, turning losses into profits and making him a 'business wizard' admired by all. Yet, only Pei Qian knows the truth behind his success, longing for the day when he can truly lose money.",
