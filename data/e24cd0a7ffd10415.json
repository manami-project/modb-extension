  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Pei Qian was an ordinary man who unexpectedly found himself bound to a strange wealth conversion system that gave him funds to start a business. However, the peculiar catch was that Pei Qian would personally earn more money if his business lost money. Motivated by this, Pei Qian decided to enter the high-risk game industry and deliberately produce terrible games that he hoped would flop, allowing him to pocket the losses. However, despite Pei Qian's best efforts to fail, the games he created ended up becoming wildly popular instead. As the president of Tengda Corporation, Pei Qian was hailed as a business genius even as he painfully watched his company grow into a massively successful $100 billion enterprise spanning gaming, internet, devices, media, catering and more. While the outside world perceives Pei Qian as a visionary trailblazer, he alone knows the ironic truth that his astronomical success is the result of persistently trying and failing to lose money. Fate, it seems, had other plans for this accidental business wizard.",
