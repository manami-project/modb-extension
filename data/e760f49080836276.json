    "text": "You Keika is a young man who comes from a lineage of esteemed exorcists, but has fallen on hard times after losing his parents. Struggling to make ends meet, he works odd jobs telling fortunes and repairing computers. One fateful night, while scavenging in a junkyard, You has a chance encounter with Tanmoku Ki, a mysterious white-haired exorcist battling evil spirits. Intrigued, You watches the display of spiritual power. But tragedy strikes when You is suddenly killed in an accident at the junkyard. Upon awakening, he discovers his spirit remains in the world of the living. It is then that Tanmoku Ki approaches You with a proposition: form a pact to fight evil spirits together, with Tanmoku providing protection and guidance in the spiritual arts, and You serving as his ever-present spirit shadow and guardian. United by this supernatural contract, the two find themselves immersed in the unseen world of ghosts and demons. There they face dangerous threats, overcoming challenges through teamwork and growing trust. Hardened warrior and vulnerable spirit forge an unlikely bond - one that deepens from obligation to a stirring admiration neither expected. Together, they vow to use their powers to keep both worlds safe. But can an exorcist truly join forces with a restless soul...or is a deeper mystery binding their fates?",
