  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Saoko Andou is an eccentric high school girl who refers to herself as a \"megaklutz\" due to her chronic tardiness and clumsiness. One morning while rushing to school, she forgets a crucial piece of clothing - her underwear! As she anxiously progresses through her classes, Saoko hopes she can avoid any embarrassing wardrobe malfunctions that could expose her situation to her peers. Simple actions like climbing stairs or changing clothes now pose a mortifying threat. With some luck and caution, perhaps Saoko can preserve her dignity. But for this accident-prone girl, even making it through a normal school day might prove a tricky ordeal when caught underwear-less.",
