    "text": "Autobots and Decepticons from various eras collide in the year 2004 over a newly discovered energy source, Solitarium! The peace of Autobot City is disrupted by a vicious Tyrannosaurus Rex who goes by the name Megatron. Optimus Prime and his team of Autobots must protect their city and the valuable energy source from this new threat. Meanwhile, the Decepticons, led by Starscream, are challenged by the arrival of Beast Megatron, who claims leadership over them. Amidst the chaos, the Autobots are developing technology to harness Solitarium's power. As the conflict escalates, a transformed Megatron, now known as Reverse Convoy, arrives from the planet Vehicon. However, the battle ultimately ends with the defeat of all parties involved, and the Transformers return to their respective time periods. This anime is set after the second season of the original Transformers series and promises action-packed battles and unexpected twists.",
