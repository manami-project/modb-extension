  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yui Hirasawa, a high school freshman with no particular talents or interests, stumbles upon the Light Music Club while deciding which club to join. Despite her initial misunderstanding about the club's focus and her lack of musical experience, Yui is warmly welcomed by the club's existing members—Ritsu, Mio, and Tsumugi—who are desperate to prevent the club from disbanding due to low membership. In an effort to recruit Yui, the girls offer various incentives, from food to leisurely club hours, and even perform a captivating piece that ultimately ignites Yui's passion for music.\n\nAs the newest member and guitarist, Yui embarks on a delightful journey filled with laughter, friendship, and musical growth. Despite her initial inability to play the guitar or read sheet music, Yui's determination and the support of her fellow club members help her progress. The Light Music Club works together to improve their skills, practice for performances, and ultimately create unforgettable memories during their high school years.",
