  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an effort to raise earthquake awareness, the Tohoku Regional Development Association has created a two-part anime film highlighting inspiring true stories of disaster preparation and survival from the devastating 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake and tsunami. The first part, \"Sonaeru\" (Prepare), focuses on the 1970s story of Kotoku Wamura, mayor of the small coastal village of Fudai. Despite opposition, Wamura's visionary push to construct an enormous floodgate and seawall ends up shielding Fudai from the worst of the 2011 destruction. Through flashbacks to previous regional disasters, the film shows how Wamura's foresight saved many lives. The second part titled \"Manabu\" (Learn) follows elementary school children in the hard-hit city of Kamaishi as they escape to higher ground during the 2011 tsunami. Their community had cultivated an important custom called \"Tsunami Tendenko\" that urges individuals to independently seek safety rather than wait for direction. The children end up teaching this potentially lifesaving lesson to their own parents. By dramatizing these accounts of heroic preparation and survival, the film aims to underscore the importance of disaster readiness while telling emotionally compelling stories of resilience. With vivid animation and an uplifting message, the project hopes to raise awareness and encourage vigilance in vulnerable coastal communities.",
