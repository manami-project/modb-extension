  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2032, humans and machines exist in an increasingly blurred world where cybernetic enhancements are commonplace. Amidst this technological dystopia, a series of murders by faulty prototype androids has drawn the attention of Public Security Section 9, an elite counter cyber-terrorism unit. With the Major missing after recent events, Section 9 cyborg veteran Batou and his newly assigned human partner Togusa investigate the suspicious deaths. Their case plunges them into the shadowy intersections of humankind and technology, uncovering corporate conspiracies, illegal AI, and the unsettling limits of machine sentience lurking beneath the surface of daily life. Confronting vicious Yakuza enforcers, genius yet unstable hackers, and government bureaucrats more machine than man, Batou and Togusa race to expose the shocking motives driving both the murders and their cover-up before they too get lost in the maze of wires, circuits, and political secrets threatening their very definitions as people. Their quest for the elusive truth reveals that perfect androids and perfect humans are both mirages - and that the future might not be as progressive as it seems on the surface.",
