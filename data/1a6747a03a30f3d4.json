  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Chihaya Ayase is a strong-willed and energetic girl who grew up supporting her sister's modeling dreams. However, her life changes when she meets Arata Wataya, a quiet transfer student who introduces her to competitive karuta. Karuta is a physically and mentally demanding card game inspired by classic Japanese poetry. Captivated by Arata's love for karuta, Chihaya falls in love with the game as well. She starts playing with Arata and her childhood friend Taichi Mashima as part of the Shiranami Society karuta club. The trio spends their childhood immersed in competitive karuta until circumstances lead them to part ways in middle school. In high school, Chihaya's passion for karuta has not waned. She sets out to establish a competitive karuta club at her school with the goal of competing in the national championship at Omi Shrine. Though initially indifferent, Taichi reunites with Chihaya to help her form the Mizusawa High Karuta Club. Together, along with some spirited newcomers, they train extensively with the ambition of one day reuniting with Arata through karuta and becoming the best players in Japan.",
