  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Natsume Kiroemon is the 45th leader of the Natsume family, a powerful clan in possession of the 'Kiryuu no Mimi', a tool that grants its owner good fortune and success with the opposite sex. As the next heir, Kiroemon had been training at a monastery in Italy, but returns to Japan upon his father's death to inherit his title and the Kiryuu no Mimi. Back in Japan, Kiroemon falls deeply in love with Kanako, a member of the rival Mina family. However, the Mina clan repeatedly attacks Kiroemon and eventually abducts Kanako, holding her hostage in an attempt to undermine the Natsume family's power. Unwilling to let his love be used against him, Kiroemon unlocks the Kiryuu no Mimi's full potential. With the mystical tool boosting his strength and luck, he sets out to confront the Mina clan and free his beloved Kanako from their clutches.",
