After his father's death, Natsume leaves his training at an Italian monastery to claim his birthright as the family leader and the power of Kouryuu no Mimi. Upon his return to Japan, he finds himself irresistibly drawn to Kanako, a member of the hostile Mina family. The Mina family, exploiting this vulnerability, relentlessly attacks Natsume and kidnaps Kanako.
