  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They say the Netherworld is a place shrouded in darkness, a place where evil gathers, and a place ruled by the king of devils, Krichevskoy. But when the king dies, the land is thrown into chaos, and ambitious demons rise to claim the throne. Enter Laharl, the prince of the Netherworld, who awakens from a two-year slumber to find his land in disarray. With the help of his mischievous servant Etna and an angel assassin-in-training named Flonne, Laharl sets out on a journey to reclaim his rightful place as the ruler of the Netherworld. Along the way, they face hardships, misadventures, and bizarre encounters with dragons, sorceresses, robots, power-hungry humans, and corrupt angels. Based on the popular adventure game Disgaea, this anime is a full-force attack of laughter, tears, and screams. Will Laharl be able to conquer the Netherworld and become the Overlord, or will he fall victim to the chaos that surrounds him? One thing is for sure: you can't escape the wrath of Laharl, dood!",
