  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Natsuki, Tomoya, Keiichi, and Tsuyoshi are four high school boys with distinct personalities who spend their free time together having fun and talking about romance. On Christmas Eve, the hopeless romantic Natsuki is dumped by his girlfriend. While crying in public, he meets Anna, a girl from his school dressed in a Santa outfit handing out tissues. Natsuki instantly falls for her and impulsively gives her the scarf meant for his ex. However, the aloof Anna does not reciprocate his feelings. Natsuki's close friends learn about his new unrequited love and try helping him win Anna over, though he would prefer they don't meddle. Tomoya is a narcissistic playboy dating multiple girls. Keiichi is a quirky sadist who carries a whip. Tsuyoshi is an otaku with a cosplayer girlfriend. As Natsuki tries confessing his feelings to the disinterested Anna, his friends pursue their own colorful romantic relationships and regularly weigh in on Natsuki's love life, though their involvement is often more hindrance than help.",
