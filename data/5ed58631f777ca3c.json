    "text": "Tsuyoshi, Keiichi, Tomoya, and Natsuki are four high school friends who share a common goal: to navigate the thrilling and often perplexing world of romance. With no club activities to occupy their time, they focus on their studies and spend the rest of their days in pursuit of love and fun. Natsuki, the hopeless romantic of the group, finds himself smitten with Anna, a girl from another class. However, his friends' constant meddling in his love life makes his pursuit of Anna far from straightforward. Meanwhile, Tomoya, the resident playboy, juggles multiple girlfriends, while Keiichi, the kinky sadist, and Tsuyoshi, the otaku with a cosplaying girlfriend, have their own romantic endeavors to contend with. When Natsuki's heart is broken on Christmas Eve, a chance encounter with Anna, dressed as Santa and offering him tissues, sparks a new love interest. Will Natsuki, with the help of his well-meaning but nosy friends, be able to win Anna's heart and mend his own? Join these four friends as they experience the highs and lows of teenage romance in this heartwarming and hilarious anime.",
