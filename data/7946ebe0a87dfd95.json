    "text": "Fortress Macross's Haruhiko Mikimoto brings to life Rayca, a digital girl from the 31st century, in an anime that explores the beauty of human sub-cultures. In a world where individuals exist solely as computer data, Rayca embarks on a journey to the 21st century to learn about our unique way of life. She wanders through bustling cities, observing the little things that make humanity special - from trains passing through crossings to cats lounging in boxes on city streets. As she experiences the best of our world, including photo shoots and interviews, Rayca discovers the joy and charm of human existence. With a theme song by Tsubasa Makoto, this anime promises to be a heartwarming exploration of what it means to be human.",
