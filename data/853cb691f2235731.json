  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Avenger extraordinaire, Tony Stark, finds himself in a perilous face-off against the menacing Ezekiel Stane, the son of his late adversary, Obadiah Stane. Stane's nefarious plan involves unleashing a devastating biotechnology known as Technovore, a weapon capable of annihilating life on Earth. As Stark prepares to launch his new spy satellite, 'Howard', Stane orchestrates a vicious terrorist attack, leaving a trail of destruction and casualties, including Stark's close friend, Lt. Colonel James Rhodes, also known as War Machine.\n\nFramed for the attack, Stark's Iron Man becomes the target of a relentless manhunt by S.H.I.E.L.D. and is forced to evade capture while seeking to clear his name. With Black Widow and Hawkeye hot on his trail, Iron Man turns to the unyielding vigilante, The Punisher, for assistance. As Iron Man delves deeper into the mystery behind the attack, he must confront his deadliest adversary yet and find a way to neutralize the Technovore before it's too late. Will the Armored Avenger triumph against the odds, or will he succumb to the sinister machinations of Ezekiel Stane?",
