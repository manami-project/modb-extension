    "text": "Erina Nakiri, the revered \"God's Tongue\" in the culinary world, finds herself in unfamiliar territory after fleeing her oppressive father and the sudden changes at Tootsuki Culinary Academy. Seeking refuge at the Polar Star Dormitory, Erina is thrust into a world far removed from her usual refined lifestyle. Struggling with mundane tasks like laundry and vacuuming, she quickly discovers that life outside her father's shadow is more challenging than she anticipated. Despite these challenges, Erina begins to find solace and camaraderie among the dormitory's eccentric residents. As she navigates through a series of firsts, including a visit to a public bath, Erina embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth. This heartwarming tale, bundled with the 29th volume of the Shokugeki no Souma manga, offers a glimpse into Erina's life beyond the kitchen, filled with chaos, laughter, and unforgettable experiences.",
