Meet Tenma Tsukamoto, a second-year student who's head over heels for her classmate, Oji Karasuma. The catch? She can't seem to muster the courage to confess her feelings. As Karasuma prepares to transfer schools, Tenma, with the help of her friends and sister, embarks on a series of outlandish schemes to finally reveal her true feelings.\n\nBut Tenma isn't alone in her romantic conundrum. Enter Kenji Harima, the school's infamous delinquent, who's nursing his own unrequited love for none other than Tenma herself. Determined to turn over a new leaf and win her heart, Harima struggles to express his feelings, leading to a series of comedic misunderstandings and mishaps.\n\nAs these two love-struck teenagers navigate the treacherous waters of adolescence, they'll discover that love isn't always straightforward, and sometimes, the most unexpected plans lead to the most surprising outcomes.
