    "text": "Sakura Sakurakouji, a petite yet powerful martial artist with a strong sense of justice, witnesses a horrifying scene on her bus ride home: a boy engulfing people in a mysterious blue flame. The next day, she discovers that the same boy, Oogami Rei, has joined her class as a transfer student. Despite his charming demeanor, Rei hides a dark secret: he's a Code Breaker, a ruthless assassin who operates outside the law, using fire to mete out his unique brand of justice. Driven by the belief that killing is never justified, Sakura vows to change Rei's cold-hearted ways and uncover the truth behind his enigmatic persona. As she delves deeper into his world, the line between hero and villain begins to blur, forcing Sakura to question her own beliefs about justice and retribution.",
