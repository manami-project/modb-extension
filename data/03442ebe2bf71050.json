  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Goro is a listless high school student who feels detached from the world around him. When a mysterious invitation appears on his phone offering to grant him one wish, Goro jokingly asks for his classmate Honoka to pay attention to him. To his shock, his \"wish\" comes true and Honoka suddenly becomes interested in him. However, Goro soon learns this was no ordinary wish-granting. He has been entered into a competition to become the next God. The other candidates all possess special powers and will fight to the death until only one remains. Even Honoka turns on Goro, revealing herself as one of the god candidates intent on killing him. Thrust into this chaotic battle for divinity, Goro receives an ability of his own called the Scripture of Fools. This power can manipulate cause and effect, but comes at a great personal cost each time it is used. As Goro struggles to understand the rules of this ruthless competition, he searches for potential allies while also trying to evade those hunting him down. With the stakes so high, can Goro leverage his strange new power to outwit death itself? Or will he lose everything in this absurd contest to become God?",
