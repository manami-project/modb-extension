    "text": "Bug-eyed and muscular, Gorou Tatsumi, affectionately known as Chuhai, is an undercover detective at Shinjuku station with a knack for finding trouble. With his brute strength and unyielding stubbornness, he frequently rescues his young girlfriend from a series of awkward predicaments while simultaneously waging war on crime. But when an unsuspecting encounter with a hooker leads to an unexpected romance, their lives take a dramatic turn. A scorned former client of the hooker disapproves of their newfound love, leading to a violent knife attack on Tatsumi. Now, it's up to the hooker to uncover the identity of the attacker and seek justice. Based on a manga by Sho Fumimura, this anime is set to the backdrop of 1960s U.S. hit parade music.",
