    "text": "Japan's peace is disrupted when a UFO from the far reaches of the cosmos unleashes a formidable metal-consuming monster, Gilgilgan, onto its shores. The country's two most powerful super robots, Getter Robo and Great Mazinger, engage in a fierce battle to protect their homeland. Initially, the rivalry between the Science Fortress Laboratory and the Saotome Institute hinders their progress, leading to separate and unsuccessful attempts to defeat the alien menace. However, as the monster's destructive power escalates and Great Mazinger is left in dire need of repair, the two factions realize the urgency of unifying their forces. With Getter Robo stalling the creature's onslaught, the combined might of the two robots emerges as the last hope for Japan's survival. Will their united strength be enough to vanquish Gilgilgan before it annihilates the entire nation? Prepare for an exhilarating showdown as Getter Robo and Great Mazinger join forces to save their world!",
