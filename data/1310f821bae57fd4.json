  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a distant future, humanity is divided between two warring factions - Union and Deague. The story follows Sara Werec, a 16-year-old girl training to be a Reasoner, a pilot of the manned mecha Strain used by Union forces. Sara is driven by her desire to reunite with her beloved brother Ralph, who left to fight on the frontlines when she was just 11. Years later, Sara's academy comes under attack by Deague forces led by none other than Ralph himself. He steals a mysterious capsule before destroying the academy and disappearing, leaving Sara devastated. With her dreams shattered, she joins a new squad under an assumed name, determined to uncover the truth about her brother's betrayal and confront him on the battlefield. Braving the endless sacrifices of war, Sara struggles against enemy and former friend alike in her quest to understand Ralph's actions. What she discovers will challenge everything she thought she once knew about her brother, her faction, and the nature of the conflict itself. Driven by familial bonds, yet tempered by loss, Sara perseveres in hopes of reconciliation - and a chance for peace.",
