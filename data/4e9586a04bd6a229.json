    "text": "After the successful creation of Litchi, a human-like robot powered by lychee fruit, the once tumultuous Hikari Club finds itself thriving in an alternate reality under the enigmatic leadership of Zera. This cult-like club of nine high school boys, hidden in the industrial town of Keiko-cho, has finally achieved their goal: kidnapping the beautiful Kanon with the help of their AI robot. With their mission accomplished, the Hikari Club indulges in their newfound lives, exploring various uses for Litchi and selling their fruit-powered technology. As they embark on new adventures, there's no predicting what this quirky club and their self-aware robot will do next in this comical adaptation of a psychological-horror manga.",
