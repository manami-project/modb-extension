    "text": "Problem: In the near future, a junior high student, Sakura Kusakabe, is destined to create a technology that will halt the aging process of women after they turn twelve, a consequence of his questionable preferences. To prevent this, the divine being Dokuro-chan is sent from the future to eliminate Sakura. However, Dokuro-chan develops a fondness for Sakura and decides to protect him instead, albeit with deadly consequences.\n\nSolution: Dokuro-chan moves in with Sakura and makes it her mission to keep him preoccupied, ensuring he never gets the chance to create the problematic technology. However, her volatile temper often leads to Sakura's untimely demise, usually at the hands of her thorned bat, Excalibolg. But fear not, for Dokuro-chan possesses the power to resurrect Sakura with a magical chant, \"Pipiru Piru Piru Pipiru Pi.\"\n\nAs Sakura navigates through this chaotic existence, he must dodge Dokuro-chan's lethal outbursts and her fellow angel, Sabato, who is sent to complete Dokuro-chan's original mission. Will Dokuro-chan's unconventional methods save Sakura and the future of womankind, or will her impulsive actions lead to further chaos? Only time will tell in this unpredictable and darkly comedic tale of love, redemption, and the occasional resurrection.",
