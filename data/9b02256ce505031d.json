    "text": "Sahoto Ashisu, a dedicated assistant, finds herself in the chaotic world of manga creation alongside her eccentric and perverted mangaka, Aito Yuuki. As Aito struggles to understand the emotions of his characters and meet his editor's demanding deadlines, he turns to Ashisu for help, often crossing personal boundaries in the name of \"research.\"\n\nTheir workplace dynamic is further complicated by the arrival of new assistant Rinna Fuwa, an ardent admirer of Aito's work, and Sena Kuroi, a talented manga artist with a sadistic streak. As Aito navigates the challenges of his career, his questionable antics and constant pursuit of ecchi material keep the office atmosphere lively, to say the least.\n\nWill Aito and his assistants manage to maintain their sanity and meet their deadlines amidst the chaos of their workplace? Join them in this comedic exploration of the life of a mangaka, where the line between professional and personal is constantly blurred.",
