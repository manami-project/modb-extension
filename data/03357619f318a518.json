  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Although the world is divided into two realms—the inner land inhabited by humans and the outer land populated by cursed beings—an extraordinary bond forms between a young girl named Shiva and an inhuman creature she affectionately calls \"Teacher.\" Found on the border of the inner land amidst a pile of abandoned bodies, Shiva and Teacher embark on a journey of quiet coexistence, defying the age-old warning to never cross to the other side. As Shiva seeks her grandmother, their secret connection comes to light, revealing a heartwarming tale of friendship and loyalty that transcends the boundaries of their contrasting worlds. Based on Nagabe's The Girl from the Other Side: Siúil, a Rún manga, this anime adaptation will be released as an original anime DVD (OAD) and is set to ship on March 10, 2022.",
