When fate leads him to cross paths with Hijikata Toshizo and Okita Souji, two wandering samurai making a name for themselves in Kyoto, his life is forever altered. Though initially seen as troublemakers, Nio soon realizes the \"Wolves of Mibu\" operate by a strong moral code, protecting the helpless when no one else will. After the swordsmen rescue Nio and his sister Iroha from danger, Nio is inspired to join their cause. As he trains with the rogue band that will one day form the Shinsengumi, Nio bears witness to a tide of betrayal and violence threatening to wash over Japan. With the nation on the brink of monumental upheaval, Nio and the Wolves of Mibu find themselves at the heart of the action.
