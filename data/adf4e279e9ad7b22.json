    "text": "In the distant future, 10,000 years from now, the world has become overrun by monsters and vampire lords who rule the land. People live humble lives reminiscent of the past, despite some technological advances. In one small village plagued by monster attacks lives Doris, a young girl who catches the eye of the powerful vampire Count Magnus Lee. After Doris is bitten and selected to become the Count's bride, she desperately seeks help. Enter D, a stoic, elite vampire hunter who wanders the lands. Upon hearing Doris's plea, D takes it upon himself to free her from the Count's grasp. He prepares to venture forth, ready to cut through the Count's many minions and put an end to his centuries-long rule over the region. Though D has his own shadowy motives for confronting the vampire lord, Doris sees him as her only hope for escape from the Count's clutches. Their encounter sets the stage for an epic confrontation between hunter and vampire.",
