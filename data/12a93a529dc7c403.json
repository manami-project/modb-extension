    "text": "Youta Narukami is a high school student looking forward to enjoying his last summer vacation before college entrance exams. However, his plans are interrupted when a peculiar girl named Hina Satou appears, claiming to be an omniscient goddess. Hina tells Youta that the world will end in 30 days. He is skeptical at first, but soon witnesses her supernatural ability to predict the future. Convinced of her powers, Youta now believes Hina's warning about the coming apocalypse. Despite having foretold the end of the world, Hina has no intention to save it. Instead, she moves in with Youta to experience a lively final summer. As the fated day approaches, Youta spends his possibly last days with the enigmatic Hina and his friends, making memories before time runs out.",
