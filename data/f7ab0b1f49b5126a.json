    "text": "Wandenreich, led by the formidable Quincy King Yhwach, has launched a relentless assault on Soul Society, leaving the Shinigami forces battered and bruised. As they scramble to prepare for the final battle, Ichigo Kurosaki, armed with his true Zanpakuto, undergoes rigorous and perilous training under Squad Zero to unlock a hidden power. But time is running out, as Yhwach infiltrates Soul Society, turning the battlefield against the Shinigami. To make matters worse, Ichigo must confront his friend-turned-foe, Uryu Ishida, who has joined the enemy ranks. With the fate of every soul hanging in the balance and only nine days left according to a Quincy prophecy, Ichigo and his allies face seemingly insurmountable odds in this epic blood war.",
