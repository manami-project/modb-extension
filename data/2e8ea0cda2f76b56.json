    "text": "Or iginated by a confrontation with the formidable Nomu Hood, equipped with a myriad of quirks, the League of Villains is revealed to be the mastermind behind the incident. Endeavor, with Hawks' assistance, narrowly defeats Hood, who is then captured by the villainous Dabi. Amidst this chaos, Izuku grapples with visions of past \"One for All\" quirk holders, causing his powers to surge uncontrollably.\n\nMeanwhile, the tension between UA Academy's Class 1-A and Class 1-B escalates as the latter feels overshadowed by the attention garnered by their rivals. To settle the score, a series of mock battles are organized, pitting teams of four against each other. The stakes are raised with the inclusion of Shinsou, a General Course student aspiring to join the Hero Course. Despite his limited combat experience and brainwashing quirk, Shinsou is determined to prove his worth. As each class vies to demonstrate their superiority, the stage is set for an intense showdown.",
