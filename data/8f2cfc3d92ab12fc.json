  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Thus begins the whimsical tale of a middle school teacher, Nobunaga, who has always been a hopeless romantic, yearning for a love story akin to the plot of a dating sim game. His mundane life takes a dramatic turn when a young girl, Kicho, from the Sengoku era materializes before him, declaring herself to be his wife. In her eyes, Nobunaga is none other than the legendary warlord, Oda Nobunaga, and she is determined to bear his children. Amidst the chaos and confusion, a comedic love story unfolds between a modern-day teacher with a heart full of dreams and a young princess from the past with a mind full of historical battles. Brace yourself for an age-gap love comedy that transcends time!",
