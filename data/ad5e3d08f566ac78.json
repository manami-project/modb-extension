    "text": "Empire of a menacing Green Queen, decimated by nuclear blasts, sets its sights on Earth for reconstruction, initiating a reign of terror. When a peaceful space voyage is brutally interrupted, resulting in the abduction of innocent passengers and the murder of a revered Ninja Master, the Cosmos Warriors, guardians of universal peace, are thrust into action.\n\nCaptain Leo, a valiant leader, and his fearless team intercept a distress call from Earth, igniting a rescue mission that quickly turns into a perilous battle against the sinister Green People and their ruthless Queen. Despite an initial setback, Leo's unwavering courage and formidable skills catch the Queen's attention, leading to a treacherous deal: Leo's combat against her fiercest warriors in exchange for the captives' liberty.\n\nHowever, the Queen's deceit becomes apparent when she reneges on her promise, sparking a brutal conflict. Meanwhile, Johnny Destiny, a dedicated Space Ranger and disciple of the slain Ninja Master, pledges vengeance against the Queen, aligning himself with the Cosmos Warriors. With the fate of Earth hanging in the balance, only Johnny, armed with the ancient knowledge of the sword of light, stands between the malevolent Green Queen and global domination.",
