  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Three sisters - Ai, Mai, and Mii - travel through time and space in search of answers, accompanied by their android maid Mea and pet ferret Unagi. Their fantastical house acts as a mode of transport, carrying them across eras and dimensions without ever leaving home. Clues from the mysterious Popotan (dandelions) guide their journey. While the Popotan hold insight into the sisters' personal questions, the destination remains unclear. Along the way, the kind-hearted Ai talks to flowers, athletic Mai performs magical feats of agility, and little Mii wields her powers as a magical girl. Between adventures, they befriend new faces, run a Christmas shop within their house, and indulge at hot springs - finding joy and laughter even as poignant goodbyes loom. Through time and space, friendship and discovery, the sisters seek answers. Yet their quest holds surprises beyond what the Popotan have foretold. Where the house will land next, only time will tell.",
