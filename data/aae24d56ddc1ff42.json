    "text": "Samurai\"/\"Shichinin no Samurai'. In a war-torn era where samurais fortify their bodies with machinery, a destructive conflict ravages a planet that could have been our Earth. After the war's end, a fragile peace emerges, and the true rulers become wealthy merchants who wield influence over the Emperor and employ military forces at their whim. However, the villagers suffer at the hands of ruthless bandits, once honorable samurai who have abandoned their code and now pillage villages for food and women.\n\nDesperate and facing starvation, the residents of Kanna Village decide to hire samurai to protect them from the bandits. The village's water priestess, Kirara, her younger sister Komachi, and a distraught villager named Rikichi embark on a perilous journey to recruit samurai, armed with nothing but rice from their scarce harvests. Through a series of dangerous encounters and fortunate events, they manage to assemble a group of seven samurai, each with unique skills and experience.\n\nInspired by Akira Kurosawa's iconic film 'Seven Samurai', Samurai 7 unfolds as an epic battle between these noble warriors and the merciless bandits who threaten the village's survival. With the odds stacked against them, will the samurai succeed in protecting the villagers, or will they fall victim to the very same mechanized monsters they once were?",
