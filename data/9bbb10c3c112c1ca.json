    "text": "Delmin, Ruhuyu, and Himiko, a trio of city girls with a shared passion for music, find their rhythm disrupted when Howan, a foxgirl from the countryside, bursts onto the scene. Armed with her guitar and a heart full of ambition, Howan has left her tranquil life behind to chase her dreams of stardom in the bustling Midi City. As fate would have it, the girls' paths cross during a spontaneous live performance, and Howan finds herself drawn into their musical world.\n\nTogether, they form the band Mashumairesh, and the once-timid Howan begins to blossom under the city lights. Meanwhile, guitarist Himiko struggles with her role in the band, feeling out of place alongside her fellow musicians. As the girls navigate their way through the glittering music scene, they'll discover that the key to success lies in the bonds they forge with one another.\n\nWith their sights set on the stars, Mashumairesh prepares to face off against their first major rival, the all-male group DOKONJOFINGER. In this dazzling city where dreams come true, anything is possible, and the stage is set for an unforgettable showdown. Will Howan and her friends rise to the challenge and make their mark on the world of music? Only time will tell.",
