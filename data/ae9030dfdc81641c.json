    "text": "Jiksae's camera captures an unexpected brawl between Yoo Hobin, a seemingly ordinary high school student, and himself. Hobin, who has been suffering at the hands of bullies both at school and his part-time job, reaches his breaking point and fights back against Jiksae. Unbeknownst to them, the video goes viral overnight, garnering Hobin an impressive sum of money and opening up a new opportunity to pay his mother's hospital bills.\n\nWith Jiksae, a ruthless opportunist, by his side, Hobin embarks on a journey to create more content for their popular NewTube channel. The duo seeks out other bullies and troublemakers, turning Hobin into an unlikely star in the world of online fighting. However, as their videos gain more attention, so does the number of people seeking revenge, putting their safety at risk.\n\nCan Hobin continue to outsmart his opponents and rise to the top of the streaming world, or will he eventually face a challenge he cannot overcome? Only time will tell as this scrawny high school student defies expectations and fights for a better life.",
