    "text": "With the first snowfall of winter, Takashi Natsume embarks on a tranquil walk, only to encounter a peculiar snowman youkai with an inexplicable longing for something warm and radiant. Despite the vagueness of the spirit's desire, Natsume is determined to assist in her search for the mysterious object.\n\nAs the icy winter air settles, Natsume finds himself accompanied by Nyanko-sensei, who indulges in the warmth of a hot-water bottle. Meanwhile, his aunt busies herself preparing a hearty meal. Amidst the serenity, Natsume's stroll is interrupted by an unusual snowman youkai, her unsettling black eyes hinting at a yearning for something warm and glistening. With no concrete clues, Natsume is compelled to aid the spirit in her quest for the elusive item.\n\nThis original video anime, aired on 5th February 2014 and included in the Blu-ray & DVD package, features the beloved cast from the four television anime series. In addition, the package contains the Chapter ~ SOUND THEATRE x Natsume's Book of Friends ~ gathering sound play, which was held on September 28.",
