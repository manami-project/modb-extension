    "text": "A martial arts tournament called \"The First Strongest Hero Fighting Tournament\" is taking place in Japan before a large audience. The organizer, Miyake Masaharu, is waiting for a special guest to arrive before starting the competition. Suddenly, he spots Son Goku flying in on his magical cloud Kinto-Un. Goku leaps down dramatically, throws some playful punches and kicks, and declares he's ready to take on strong opponents. However, Miyake-san informs Goku that he was brought in as a commentator, not a fighter. That's fine with Goku, as long as there are powerful contestants competing.",
