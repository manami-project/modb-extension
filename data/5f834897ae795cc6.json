    "text": "Five years after a mysterious global disaster caused parts of cities around the world to inexplicably disappear, a group of enthusiastic girls seeks to revive people's spirits. Calling themselves \"Alice in Theater,\" they aim to put smiles on faces through inspirational stage performances utilizing advanced 3D hologram technology. When Seria Morino receives an invitation to join, she is initially captivated by the prospect of being part of something greater. However, upon joining the troupe, Seria starts noticing oddities, and she gradually uncovers unsettling truths about the people around her and the events that set everything in motion years prior. As Seria immerses herself deeper into the workings of Alice in Theater, she realizes that things are not quite what they seem. What started out as a noble goal to uplift others takes on a more complex dimension. Seria must navigate this increasingly mystifying situation while pursuing her passion for performance.",
