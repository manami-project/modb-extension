    "text": "Nao is an ordinary middle school student who leads a two-member photography club at her school. Along with her best friend Miki, they often head to the school's rooftop to photograph the skies and clouds. One day while taking pictures, Nao encounters a mysterious flying cat that can manipulate the wind. Startled by this strange cat, she loses her footing and falls off the roof, but is saved by her teacher, Mr. Taiki. It is soon revealed that Mr. Taiki and others belong to an ancient clan of \"wind handlers\" who can control the winds. Every summer, they return to their secret home village located on the outskirts of the city to celebrate the Wind Festival. After her life is saved and she learns of her own latent powers over the wind, a curious Nao decides to travel to this village along with Miki and her classmate Ryoko who has a crush on Mr. Taiki. There they unravel the mysteries of the wind handlers' clan and explore their own wind-controlling talents. With flying cats, lost squirrels, photography contests, and the unfolding Wind Festival, Nao and her friends are swept into a world of magic and excitement as they come to understand the hidden secrets carried on the wind. Their wind-filled summer adventure is just beginning.",
