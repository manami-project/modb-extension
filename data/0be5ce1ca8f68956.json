    "text": "Estate living exposition, this short anime film by Makoto Shinkai introduces us to Aya Okamura, a young woman navigating the challenges of adulthood in near-future Japan. Having recently started a new job, Aya finds herself living independently, away from her family home. Her mother, a doctor, has been working overseas since Aya's childhood, leaving her father and their beloved cat, Mii-san, as the sole occupants of their residence.\n\nOne evening, after a particularly exhausting day at work, Aya declines her father's dinner invitation, feigning a late shift at the office. As she unwinds and reminisces about happier times spent with her family, her phone rings, delivering unexpected news that could potentially bridge the gap between Aya and her loved ones. Prepare for a heartwarming journey that explores the complexities of family relationships and the power of nostalgia in this poignant tale by the acclaimed director of 'Your Name' and 'Weathering with You.'",
