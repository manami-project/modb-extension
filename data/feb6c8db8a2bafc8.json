    "text": "Anime enthusiasts can look forward to an exciting event this autumn, as the Federation of International Vanguard Associations (FIVA) organizes the 'G Quest'. With the promise of the prestigious title 'Generation Master' and the opportunity to become a Clan Leader, the stakes are high for those who conquer the six Branch Quests. The members of TRY3 are brimming with anticipation for the challenges ahead, but unbeknownst to them, a sinister plot threatening the very existence of Vanguard is unfolding in the shadows. Ibuki Kouji's enigmatic Plan-G is set in motion, leaving Chrono and the rest to navigate through unforeseen encounters. Will they rise to the occasion and secure a triumphant future? Only time will tell. (Source: Assimilated Synopses)",
