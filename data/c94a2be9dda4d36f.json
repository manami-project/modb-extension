As she delves deeper into this dangerous world, she targets criminals deemed 'morally curable' for organ harvesting, grappling with her own moral dilemmas along the way.\n\nJoin Tamaki on her blood-soaked journey, as she balances her search for her missing loved one with her role in this sinister underworld. Will she find what she's looking for, or will she become another casualty in this ruthless game?
