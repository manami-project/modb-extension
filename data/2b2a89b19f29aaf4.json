    "text": "In the heart of a bustling city, there's a Chinese ramen shop where Miki Onimaru, a seemingly ordinary waitress and delivery girl, serves up more than just piping hot bowls of noodles. With a sweet smile and charming demeanor, she attracts patrons to her mother's establishment, but beneath her innocent facade lies a volatile and violent persona.\n\nMiki, who has a history of brutal domestic altercations with her equally terrifying mother, possesses a destructive prowess that rivals infamous historical figures. Despite her penchant for violence, she also harbors a compassionate side, often embarking on implausible missions to rescue lost kittens, both metaphorically and literally. However, some may misinterpret her kind gestures as mere neglect of her duties.\n\nIn this chaotic world, Miki teeters on the edge of tranquility and turmoil, striving to complete her mundane tasks without triggering her explosive temper. Will she manage to navigate through her day-to-day life without inciting her mother's wrath or causing further calamities? Join Miki Onimaru as she delivers a unique blend of ramen and ruckus in this thrilling anime.",
