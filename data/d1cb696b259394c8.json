  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Manned by rookie pilot Kou Uraki, the Gundam GP01, also known as 'Zephyranthes', stands as the Earth Federation's last line of defense against the resurgent threat of the Zeon remnants. Three years have passed since the end of the devastating One Year War, yet tensions still simmer between the two factions. The Delaz Fleet, a rogue Zeon military group, seeks to rebuild Zeon and reignite the conflict. Their ace pilot, Anavel Gato, steals the nuclear-equipped Gundam GP02, codenamed 'Physalis', from a Federation research base. As Gato spearheads Operation Stardust, a large-scale operation aimed at shaking the very foundations of the Federation, Uraki and the crew of the Albion carrier must embark on a perilous journey to recover the stolen Gundam and prevent another catastrophic war. With the fate of Earth and the colonies hanging in the balance, a dramatic and melodramatic war epic unfolds.",
