  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kyan Nanafa, a vivacious middle school student, resides in the picturesque Okinawa alongside her grandmother, who manages the local 'Kame Soba' soba shop. Her family also includes Nao, her stunning older sister navigating high school life, and Kokona, her younger sister with an uncanny knack for sensing the supernatural. One fateful day, Nanafa observes a seal dislodge from a Chinese banyan tree, resulting in the release of three spirits residing within. Among these spirits are Niina and Raana, known as 'jimunaa' spirits, and Iina, an embodiment of an Okinawan lion statue. As a myriad of spirits begin to manifest, the once serene existence of Nanafa and her family takes an unexpected turn.",
