    "text": "The new anime series is set in the Paldea region and follows three students - Ohara, Aliquis, and Houma - who attend an academy together. As they pursue their dreams, whether becoming Pokémon trainers or following other passions, their bonds with their Pokémon partners and each other deepen. Ohara is a gifted flutist preparing for an important upcoming concert, feeling pressure to succeed. We see her struggle with nerves as she practices with her partner Pokémon Fuecoco. Meanwhile, the three friends have been tasked with creating a video to showcase their school. Ohara tries her best but becomes frustrated, running off to the mountains on the pretense of a treasure hunt. Through their adventures together, both big and small, the series promises growth and learning for the trio. By leaning on their Pokémon and each other, they just might achieve their dreams after all. With beautiful scenery inspired by the Pokémon Scarlet and Violet games, this heartwarming journey explores the magic of friendship in the Pokémon world.",
