  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With All Might retired, a power vacuum emerges in both the hero and villain worlds. Shigaraki of the League of Villains competes with yakuza leader Overhaul to seize control of the criminal underworld. Meanwhile, U.A. students like Deku seek challenging internships to develop their Quirks and prove themselves as the next generation of heroes. Deku interns under Sir Nighteye, All Might's former sidekick, to further his One For All Quirk. There he learns of Overhaul's plans to utilize a young girl named Eri's mysterious Quirk to gain influence. Together with his upperclassman Mirio, Deku resolves to stop the dangerous Overhaul and save Eri from his control. However, the fall of All Might has also impacted hero society itself. Citizens feel less safe without the \"Symbol of Peace\" to rely on. The media speculate on potential successors even as villain groups make bolder moves in the shadows. U.A.'s first-year students must rapidly improve to fill the void All Might left while confronting new threats like the imposing Overhaul. Through internships and training, Deku and his friends progress towards realizing their potential as the next generation of mighty heroes.",
