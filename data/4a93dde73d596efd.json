    "text": "Midoriya, also known as Deku, and his fellow aspiring heroes at UA are back for another season of My Hero Academia. As they navigate the challenges of their second semester, the students find themselves grappling with the aftermath of All Might's retirement. The villain world, now leaderless, is on the brink of chaos, with Shigaraki and the League of Villains vying for control against the formidable yakuza leader, Overhaul.\n\nAs the search for a new number one hero intensifies, the young heroes are thrust into the spotlight, with the media eager to uncover All Might's true successor. Meanwhile, Deku lands an internship with Sir Nighteye, All Might's former sidekick, where he finds himself entangled in a dangerous investigation involving a former yakuza member and a mysterious young girl.\n\nWith fear creeping into people's hearts and the future uncertain, Deku and his friends must rise to the challenge, honing their skills through rigorous training and high-stakes internships. As the League of Villains and the yakuza wage war in the shadows, Deku and his upperclassman, Mirio, must protect the innocent and confront the looming threat of Overhaul. Who will rise to become the new Symbol of Peace? Only time will tell.",
