  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the fantasy world of Gaeabrande, the goddess Ristarte summons a hero named Seiya Ryuuguuin to save her land from destruction. Though Seiya seems exceptionally powerful, Ristarte soon realizes he is overly cautious to a fault. Terrified of any potential danger, he obsessively trains to reach maximum level, battles weak monsters at full force, and even buys three sets of every armor and item - one to use, a spare, and another spare just in case. While constantly irritated by Seiya's excessive precautions, Ristarte remains hopeful that his mighty abilities may be the key to saving Gaeabrande from its plethora of strong enemies. Join Ristarte and her anxious hero Seiya on a comedic adventure where no precaution is too small and no enemy is too weak to warrant Seiya's full, devastating power.",
