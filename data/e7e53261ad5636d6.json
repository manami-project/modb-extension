  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While the divine realm grapples with the impending doom of the super hard-mode world of Gaeabrande, the young goddess Ristarte embarks on a mission to summon a hero capable of averting the crisis. Enter Seiya Ryuuguuin, a hero of unparalleled abilities and an unyielding penchant for caution. Obsessed with muscle training and stockpiling armor, Seiya's over-preparedness knows no bounds, as he insists on having not one, but three sets of armor and annihilates even the weakest of slimes with unbridled force. As Ristarte navigates the trials and tribulations of working with her meticulous hero, an extraordinary adventure unfolds, filled with humor, action, and a healthy dose of caution. Will Seiya's excessive prudence prove to be the key to saving Gaeabrande, or will it drive Ristarte to her wit's end? Only time will tell in this epic tale of an overpowered yet overly cautious hero.",
