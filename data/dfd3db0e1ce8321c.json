    "text": "Shirobom and Aobom are B-da cops who protect the peace in the B-da Union. When they witness a spaceship crashing while being chased by space pirates, they rush to investigate. At the crash site lies Princess Akabon, sole survivor of a kingdom attacked by the pirates. Beside her is a glowing gem called Crysmond which possesses mysterious power. Seeking this gem, the space pirates - known as the Devil Vaders - invade in pursuit. Shirobom and Aobom are joined by fellow B-da cops Kiirobon and Kurobon to face this new enemy. An exciting adventure begins as the four heroes vow to safeguard both Princess Akabon and the Crysmond gem from the vicious Devil Vaders. This is but the latest chapter in the age-old struggle between good and evil in the Blue Solar System. A thousand years ago the beautiful B-da city was attacked by the forces of Dark B-da in a bid to control the entire system. Only through the strength and bravery of the legendary B-Daman warriors was peace regained. Now, with Princess Akabon and the powerful Crysmond under threat, Shirobom and friends stand ready to uphold that peace once more.",
