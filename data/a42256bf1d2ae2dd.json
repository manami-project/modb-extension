  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around a virtual world created inside an intelligent coral-like lifeform called the scub coral. Ten years ago, humans from this virtual world appeared on Earth when their world collapsed. Since then, tensions have risen between the \"Green Earth\" humans from the virtual world and the original \"Blue Earth\" humans. Dewey Novak, a high-ranking Green Earth military officer, launches a terrorism campaign with his comrades to defend Green Earth's dignity. Meanwhile, Eureka - blamed for the chaos - joins an elite combat unit to atone and protect the peace. She is assigned to guard Iris, a young girl who can control the scub coral like Eureka once could. Though they clash at first, Eureka and Iris bond in their isolation. When a crisis strikes, a near-immortal Novak hunts Iris across Europe with his extremist followers. Only Eureka stands in their way, determined to protect Iris and the planet, no matter the cost. The story promises to unveil the full truth behind the beginnings of this divided world and how Eureka's wish for peace will reshape the future.",
