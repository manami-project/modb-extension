  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This 61-minute anime film follows the relationship between two high school girls, Yi-gyeong and Suyi, over the course of two years. Yi-gyeong is an ordinary 18-year-old student who meets the athletic Suyi and develops romantic feelings for her, causing Yi-gyeong to realize her identity. Initially their relationship helps them both grow, but ironically, as Yi-gyeong continues to develop as a person, her feelings for Suyi begin to change. The story is set in a small Korean town and focuses on the dreams and personal growth of these two young girls as they fall in love and plan to move to Seoul together after high school graduation. Their relationship starts out as a budding summer romance, capturing both the excitement of young love and the gentle evolution of their feelings over time. Ultimately this anime film intimately explores the experience of two teenage girls falling in love for the first time and the poignant transformations they undergo both individually and in their relationship to one another.",
