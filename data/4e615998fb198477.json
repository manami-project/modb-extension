    "text": "Bunta Fujiwara's son, Takumi, teams up with the Takahashi brothers, Keisuke and Ryousuke, to establish 'Project D' - an ambitious racing team with a mission to push their driving prowess beyond the boundaries of their local prefecture. By leveraging the power of the internet, Project D dares other racing teams to compete and shares the outcomes of these thrilling contests online. Takumi specializes in downhill races with his trusty AE86, while Keisuke takes on the uphill challenges. Among the formidable opponents they face are the Seven-Star Leaf (SSR) and Todo-juku teams. As Ryousuke strives to perfect his 'High-Speed Street Racing Theory,' Takumi and Keisuke hone their skills on perilous roads against powerful adversaries. Adding to the excitement, Takumi's father, Bunta, joins the action with his Subaru Impreza WRX Type R Version V, setting the stage for an adrenaline-fueled adventure as Project D aims to become the ultimate street racing team.",
