    "text": "One spring, aspiring artist Tatsuhiko Kido leaves his rural life behind to attend a vocational school in the bustling city of Tokyo. In his new apartment, he stumbles upon a peculiar secret: a tiny hole in his wall. Initially, he sees nothing through it, but one day, he encounters a mysterious girl, Emiru Ikuno. As it turns out, Emiru is not just a neighbor, but a fellow art student with a voyeuristic fetish. She blackmails Tatsuhiko with compromising photos and coerces him into participating in her peeping games.\n\nAs their lives intertwine, Tatsuhiko and Emiru's unique friendship evolves in ways they never anticipated. Despite the awkwardness and embarrassment, they find themselves growing closer, even as they navigate their respective relationships. The anime Nozoki Ana explores the erotic potential and unexpected connections that can arise from this bizarre situation.",
