    "text": "Verta the green snake demon finds herself trapped in a modern city called Shura, separated from her sister Blanca. In order to rescue Blanca from the demon-slaying monk Fahai, Verta must discover a way to escape this strange new world she's found herself in. Meanwhile, two snake demons named Xiao Bai and Xiao Qing attempt to free Xiao Bai's husband Xu Xian from imprisonment by monks. However, their power proves insufficient against the formidable monk Fahai. As a result, Xiao Qing becomes trapped under the Leifeng Pagoda. She later falls through a portal into a futuristic metropolis called Asuraville, filled with creatures from different eras. There, Xiao Qing loses her demonic abilities and comes face to face with threats like a clan of terrifying ox warriors. In her quest to regain her bearings in Asuraville, Xiao Qing meets both a mysterious amnesiac man as well as a fox demon. The latter shows Xiao Qing a potential way out of this world, but at the cost of all her memories. With few good options, Xiao Qing faces danger and mystery in her struggle to escape. Both Verta and Xiao Qing find themselves trapped in strange new worlds, their quests to rescue their sisters fraught with supernatural peril. Their sagas seem destined to challenge their cunning and determination at every turn.",
