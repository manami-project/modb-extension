  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the pendulum of life swings, 'Furiko' captures the poignant journey of a couple navigating the ups and downs of their shared existence. Originally aired on a Japanese variety show, this heartfelt short anime is the brainchild of comedian Tekken, who borrowed his stage name from the iconic fighting game. The anime was later transformed into the official music video for 'Exogenesis Part 3 (Redemption)' by Muse, expanding the narrative to the full length of the song.\n\nIn 'Furiko,' a young high school student crosses paths with the woman who will become his future wife, rescuing her from a group of delinquents. As their love story unfolds, the couple faces the trials and tribulations of life together. Despite the joy they find in each other and their growing family, the husband's work-related struggles create an unbridgeable gap between them. As the wife ages and her strength wanes, the husband is haunted by the choices he made and the time that slips away.\n\nThrough the lens of Tekken's unique comedic perspective, this touching tale unfolds in just four and a half minutes, leaving viewers with a profound appreciation for the significance of every moment in life.",
