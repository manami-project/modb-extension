  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the unaired episodes of \"My Life as Inukai-san's Dog\", we follow Karen Inukai and her beloved dog Pochita through some amusing misadventures. In the first episode, Karen decides to take Pochita and their friend Mike to a dog pool so she can get some exercise. However, Mike is afraid of dogs and anxiety ensues when they make him weigh himself. The second episode revolves around the school festival. While Karen gets a break from working at her class's dog caf√©, she takes Pochita on a date around the festival attractions. There, they run into Karen's self-proclaimed \"rival\" for Pochita's affection, Usagi, who insists on tagging along wearing a bunny girl outfit. The trio end up at a haunted house attraction where the frights prove too much for the girls, leaving it up to stalwart Pochita to get them through. Through these lighthearted bonus stories, we see the bonds of friendship and devotion that tie this trio of humans and dog together, even as humorous misunderstandings or frightening situations threaten to unravel them. Pochita's steadfast canine nature keeps the group together.",
