  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime tells the story of a mermaid who makes a fateful wish to experience human love. Her wish is forbidden among her kind, and she tragically perishes. However, her story does not end there. 200 years after her death, she is reborn in modern-day Japan in Lake Biwa. Thrust into an unfamiliar human world, she must learn to adapt while still holding onto the hope that originally led to her demise - the hope of finding love. As she adjusts to her new reality, questions emerge. Will she find a place among humans where she once didn't belong? And could the love she sought in her past life still await her, even centuries later? With an endearing fish-out-of-water premise and elements of romance, this anime promises an emotional journey as the mermaid seeks to rewrite her destiny.",
