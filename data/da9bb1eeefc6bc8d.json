    "text": "Still in the throes of her first love, high school student Yuki Kurihara has managed to capture the heart of her beloved crush, Shinya 'Momo' Momotsuki. To the unassuming observer, Yuki appears to be just another sweet, unassuming girl, but beneath this innocent facade lies an ardent admirer with a peculiar devotion to Momo. From secretly photographing him to meticulously documenting his daily life, Yuki's fervor for Momo knows no bounds.\n\nAs they embark on their romantic journey together, the love-struck Yuki continues her unusual habits, amassing a collection of Momo-related memorabilia and cherishing every moment they share. Meanwhile, the endearingly inexperienced Momo grapples with the complexities of his first relationship, often finding himself in awkward situations. Despite these challenges, his sole desire is to bring happiness to his newfound love, Yuki.\n\nJoin Yuki and Momo in Momokuri, a heartwarming tale of young love that explores the peculiarities and joys of first-time romance, as well as the unique challenges that arise when two vastly different individuals come together in the pursuit of happiness.",
