  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fareed McGillis's faction of Gjallarhorn plays a double game, escalating tensions between Arbrau and the Strategic Alliance Union, leading to a war that engulfs Tekkadan. Meanwhile, Kudelia Aina Bernstein, now a consultant for the ministry on Earth, works tirelessly to secure economic independence for Mars through her newly founded Admoss Company. Tekkadan, led by Orga Itsuka, has grown into a reputable military company, serving as a consultant for Arbrau's military affairs and as an escort for Admoss's inspection of a halfmetal mining site. However, the inspection is interrupted by an attack from the Dawn Horizon Corps pirates, leading to a confrontation between Orga, Mikazuki, and their new enemies. As Tekkadan's list of allies and enemies grows, the stakes are higher than ever, and the dream of Martian independence hangs in the balance. Will Orga, Mikazuki, and the rest of the Tekkadan faction be able to keep up, or will Kudelia's dream be shattered? Only time will tell in the second season of Mobile Suit Gundam: Iron-Blooded Orphans.",
