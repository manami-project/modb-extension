    "text": "Kuga, a mysterious transfer student, and Osamu, a member of the Border Defense Agency, find themselves in a battle against otherworldly invaders known as Neighbors in the bustling Mikado City. Four years prior, a gate to another dimension had opened, allowing these technologically superior beings to invade Earth. The Border Defense Agency, equipped with alien technology-based weapons called Triggers, emerged as humanity's only defense against the Neighbors. As Osamu and Kuga face a Neighbor attack, Kuga reveals his true identity as a humanoid Neighbor from the other side of the gate, wielding a Trigger of his own. With the city still under constant threat, the Border Defense Agency continues its mission to protect the world and research Neighbor technology, while Osamu and Kuga navigate their complex alliance.",
