  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Choo's Studio Mirai once proposed an anime series called Chinka, which unfortunately never materialized. The story revolves around the tranquil mountain town of Kiyotaki, plagued by a series of arson incidents. The townsfolk whisper about the infamous arsonist, Akaneko, who has consistently evaded the police. The town's last hope lies with its sole firefighting unit, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade. However, their aggressive firefighting tactics have left them almost as feared as the arsonist they pursue.\n\nNight after night, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade and Akaneko engage in intense battles, resulting in significant damage to the town's infrastructure. The financial strain caused by these encounters pushes Kiyotaki to the brink of bankruptcy. Just when all seems lost, a girl named Chinka arrives, possessing an extraordinary ability to detect fires. With Chinka's help, the Mizuneko Fire Brigade inches closer to unmasking the true identity of Akaneko. Despite the excitement surrounding this promising series, only a 30-second promotional video was ever produced.",
