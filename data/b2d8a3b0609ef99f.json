  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Mugen, a wild and unpredictable swordsman with a penchant for causing trouble, crosses paths with Jin, a stoic and skilled ronin, in a small teahouse. When their clash of personalities leads to a destructive fight and subsequent arrest, Fuu, a clumsy but kindhearted waitress, intervenes and saves them from execution. In exchange for her help, Fuu enlists the two samurai to aid her in her quest to find a mysterious warrior who smells of sunflowers. As the unlikely trio embarks on their journey through an alternate Edo Period Japan, they encounter a mix of action, comedy, and adventure, all set to a unique hip-hop soundtrack. With Mugen's unorthodox fighting style and Jin's traditional technique, they must learn to work together and keep each other in check if they hope to fulfill Fuu's dream and uncover the secrets of her past.",
