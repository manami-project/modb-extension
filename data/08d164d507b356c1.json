    "text": "The magical kingdom of Klyrode has long been plagued by demon attacks. Desperate to protect his land, the king summons hundreds of heroes from other worlds, hoping their special talents can turn the tide. One summoned hero is Banaza, an unassuming merchant with little to offer. When his lack of abilities gets him banished from the kingdom, Banaza is left to fend for himself in monster-infested woods. However, after a surprise monster attack unexpectedly boosts Banaza to level two, his hidden holy magic powers awaken. Now under the adventurer alias \"Flio,\" Banaza returns to the kingdom. His immense magical gifts capture attention, embroiling him in the conflict instead of the quiet trading life he envisioned. But can this accidental hero help save Klyrode from darkness?",
