    "text": "Lost Christmas tells the story of two experimental subjects, Scrooge and Carol, who escape from a sinister research facility in 2029 Japan. Scrooge has undergone genetic manipulations, granting him psychic powers that he uses to eliminate their pursuers. After meeting the mysterious Carol, the two are hunted by a trio of psychic chasers. Sensing impending doom, Carol urges Scrooge to extract a concealed weapon from inside her body using his augmented right arm - their last hope for survival. Intertwined in their fate is another girl named Present. Together, these three outcasts struggle against forces that toy with them as specimens. Lost Christmas explores provocative bioethical themes while building an emotional connection to characters that just want freedom. With psychic action and profound concepts, this sci-fi anime short promises an intense viewing experience.",
