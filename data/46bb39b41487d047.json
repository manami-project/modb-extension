    "text": "Yuzu's disappointment at the canceled Kamidaio show sparks a mission for her sister Mikan and friend Ann to bring joy back to the children of Hinano. Driven by Ann's obsession with local heroines and Mikan's promise to her sister, the duo puts on an impromptu performance that, despite its amateurish charm, captivates the audience. When Misaki, the student council president and a scion of a political family, witnesses the potential of their act, she seizes the opportunity to revitalize her beloved town.\n\nMisaki enlists Mikan and Ann as Hinano's official local heroines, kicking off a series of events that will change their lives. As the girls strive to improve their performances and attract attention to their town, they gather support from a diverse group of individuals. Meanwhile, Misaki faces her own challenge: saving the cherished culture hall built by her grandfather from financial ruin.\n\nIn a world where local heroines have gained national fame, these high school girls from Hinano City embark on a journey to rejuvenate their town and preserve its cultural heritage. With their hearts set on making a difference, they'll discover the power of friendship, perseverance, and the magic of believing in oneself.",
