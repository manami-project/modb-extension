  "synopsis": {
    "text": "A kind-hearted young man named Gorou Mutsumi has faced endless misfortune, from his workplace going bankrupt to accidentally walking into signboards. However, his life takes a fortunate turn when he meets a fortune teller who gifts him a mystical phone capable of summoning Guardian Angels - a group of adorable girls who are reincarnations of pets Gorou once cared for. A year later, Gorou begins veterinary school to pursue his passion for helping animals, while the twelve Guardian Angels choose not to use their magical abilities as they continue living with Gorou. Joining Gorou's makeshift family comes with new challenges for the Angels as they grow up and adjust to ordinary life on Earth. From attending school to getting jobs, hiding their identities proves difficult, testing their dedication to Gorou. Yet through it all, the Angels remain devoted to repaying Gorou's kindness from their past life by protecting their newfound master from misfortune.",
