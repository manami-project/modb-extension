    "text": "Desperate to express their gratitude, the musical teams of Ayana Academy gear up for their final performance of the year, the Graduation Ceremony, as the school festival concludes and ushers in a new year. However, Team Ootori, once a prominent group, finds itself disqualified from participating in the ceremony following an unfortunate incident at the school festival. With Itsuki Ootori no longer part of the Kaou-kai, the team's chances of performing seem bleak. Yet, amidst the chaos, Yuuta Hoshitani and his fellow team members make a bold decision that could change their fate. Will they be able to convince the Kaou-kai to reinstate Itsuki Ootori and allow Team Ootori to perform once again? Only time will tell.",
