  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Asta's journey to become the Wizard King, despite his inability to use magic, is the central theme of the anime 'Black Clover.' The story follows Asta and his childhood friend Yuno, both orphans who were abandoned at the same church and vowed to become the next Emperor Magus. While Yuno is a natural magic prodigy, Asta struggles to use any magic at all. However, Asta's life takes a turn when he receives a rare five-leaf clover grimoire that grants him the power of anti-magic. The OVA for 'Black Clover' was first screened at Jump Festa 2016 and was later bundled with the 11th volume of the manga. With his newfound power, Asta sets out to compete against his rival and friend, Yuno, to become the greatest mage in the kingdom. Can Asta, who was once unable to use magic, really become the Wizard King? Only time will tell, but one thing is certain - Asta will never give up on his dream.",
