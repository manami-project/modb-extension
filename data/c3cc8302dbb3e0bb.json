  "synopsis": {
    "text": "How much of our personality is dictated by our blood type? This intriguing question is explored in an anime adaptation of the Korean webtoon 'A Simple Thinking about Bloodtypes'. The show humorously examines popular blood type-related stereotypes prevalent in Japan and Korea, featuring four faceless characters, each embodying a different blood type and the associated stereotypical traits. From everyday activities to extraordinary encounters with aliens, the characters continually challenge or reinforce common perceptions about their respective blood types. Join A, B, AB, and O types as they navigate through various situations, offering a unique perspective on cultural beliefs and stereotypes. Will the cautious and na√Øve A-Type prove to be kind-hearted, or will the rule-breaking B-Type surprise everyone with their actions? Only one way to find out!",
