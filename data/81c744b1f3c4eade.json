    "text": "January 1 marks the rebroadcast of Re:ZERO -Starting Life in Another World-'s first season, condensed into 12 one-hour episodes from the original 25, with new animation serving as a bridge to the second season. The story follows Natsuki Subaru, an ordinary boy who stumbles into a parallel universe on his way home from a convenience store. With no resources or connections, he discovers his newfound ability, 'Return by Death,' which allows him to turn back time upon his death. Desperate to protect his loved ones and reclaim lost moments, Subaru battles despair as he faces his grim destiny. In his new world, Subaru encounters a half-elf named Emilia, and together they embark on a dangerous journey to find a stolen object. Little does Subaru know, his special ability will lead to a vicious cycle of death and rebirth in his quest to prevent Emilia's death. The director's cut of the series includes additional scenes to set the stage for the second season, accompanied by a new PV set to the first season's hit OP, \"Redo\" by Konomi Suzuki.",
