    "text": "Re:ZERO - Starting Life in Another World follows Subaru Natsuki, an ordinary teenager who is suddenly transported to a fantasy world while returning home from the convenience store. There, he obtains the ability \"Return by Death,\" which sends him back in time after he dies, allowing him to relive critical moments and try to change outcomes. In this new world, Subaru crosses paths with the half-elf Emilia and decides to help her retrieve an important stolen item. However, their search ends tragically with both of their deaths. Subaru then realizes his \"Return by Death\" ability, cursed to relive the chain of events leading to their demise. Through an excruciating cycle of death and revival, Subaru struggles to alter the course of fate and protect Emilia. The anime's first season originally spanned 25 episodes but is being rebroadcast in edited, condensed episodes before the premiere of season two. These updated episodes contain new footage that helps transition viewers into the next part of Subaru and Emilia's journey. Faced with cruel twists of fate, Subaru must continue to persevere and draw strength from his special ability to save his loved ones in this intense, unforgiving fantasy world.",
