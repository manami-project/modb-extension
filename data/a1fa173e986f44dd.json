    "text": "SS-Ranked adventurer by night, lackadaisical prince by day, Arnold Lakes Adler expertly hides his true identity as 'Silver,' a powerful magic-wielding warrior, from the Adrasia Empire. In this vast and formidable kingdom, the struggle for the throne is a treacherous game, with each royal offspring vying for power. As the seventh prince, Arnold is dismissed by all as an incompetent and unremarkable contender, living in the shadow of his exceptional twin brother.\n\nHowever, as the battle for succession grows fiercer, Arnold decides it's time to reveal his hidden talents, not to claim the throne for himself, but to protect his own life and ensure his younger brother's victory. Concealed beneath his indifferent demeanor lies an unmatched strategic mind, masterful negotiation skills, and the strength of ancient forbidden magic.\n\nJoin Arnold, the strongest prince disguised as the weakest, as he orchestrates the fight for the throne from behind the scenes, accompanied by a group of loyal and beautiful maidens. Witness the thrilling and absurd secret maneuvers in this secret battle fantasy, as the claws of the most powerful prince are finally unsheathed.",
