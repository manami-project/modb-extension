  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Arnold is the seventh prince of the Adrasia Empire, known throughout the land as an incompetent and lackadaisical prince. However, this is merely a facade to hide his true identity as Silver, an immensely powerful SS-rank adventurer who can manipulate forbidden ancient magic. As the battle for succession of the Adrasian throne grows tense among Arnold's siblings, he has no interest in becoming Emperor himself. Yet he also has no intentions of being killed in the crossfire of politics and war. Alongside the beautiful maidens who serve him loyally, Arnold secretly uses his unrivaled wit and strength to manipulate the fight from the shadows. His aim is to maneuver his younger twin brother, the seeming favorite, into taking the throne and securing Arnold's own survival and continued comfortable lifestyle. This is the tale of the Empire's dullest prince who plays the fool while discretely taking control of the future of Adrasia as the mighty Silver, the only adventurer of legendary SS-rank strength and magical prowess.",
