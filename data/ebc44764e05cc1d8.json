    "text": "Its desolate streets echoing with silence, Tokyo stands abandoned in the near future, a casualty of the final war that erased humanity. Amidst the emptiness, a solitary basset hound roams, its heart yearning for the comforting touch of a human. As it tirelessly searches for a companion to share its days with, the hound encounters an enchanting robot in the guise of a young girl. In this forsaken world, renowned director Oshii Mamoru weaves a poignant tale of love and longing, offering a glimmer of hope in the face of despair.",
