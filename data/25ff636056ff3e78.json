    "text": "House Zichuan, a powerful faction in the chaotic world of the Western River, stands resilient after two centuries of relentless conflicts. In the south-eastern region, the family battles against the encroaching Demons to the east, defends itself from the House Liufeng to the west, and keeps the House Lin at bay in the south. The Zichuan family's grand ambition to reunite the war-torn lands is fueled by the sacrifices of countless heroes who have given their lives to preserve their lineage.\n\nWithin the Human Empire, three extraordinary brothers from the enigmatic Zichuan clan emerge as champions for their people. The eldest, Di Lin, possesses a calm and resourceful demeanor, while the middle brother, Sterling, embodies unwavering loyalty and patriotism. The youngest sibling, Zichuan Xiu, is often dismissed as a rogue but hides a wise and brave heart beneath his scandalous reputation.\n\nAs the Zichuan clan faces threats from both internal strife and external enemies, the three brothers rise to the occasion. Zichuan Xiu seizes the moment to repel the fierce Demons and selflessly risks his life to hunt down the treacherous rebel. Meanwhile, Sterling's loyalty to the family is tested as he makes the heart-wrenching decision to abandon his lover for the greater good.\n\nIn this tumultuous world, the human, demon, beast, and Far Eastern races become entangled in a web of conflict and chaos. Amidst the bloodshed, fire, and clashing swords, a vast and epic story unfolds. The animation presents a unique and captivating world, introducing a diverse cast of characters whose interwoven fates create a tragic and magnificent saga.",
