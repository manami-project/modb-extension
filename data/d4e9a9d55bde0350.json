    "text": "He's known as Ryuu, or the Crying Dragon, a man shrouded in mystery who frequently engages in games of mahjong with local gang members. His unique winning strategy is to wait for his opponents to reveal their tiles, a tactic known as 'ron' or 'naki' in mahjong, a term that coincidentally shares the same pronunciation as 'crying' in Japanese. This intriguing tale unfolds in the anime adaptation of Nojo Junichi's manga, Mahjong Hishouden Naki no Ryuu, a captivating narrative set in the 1980s-90s.",
