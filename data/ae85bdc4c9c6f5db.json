  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After defeating the Holy Knights and reclaiming the Kingdom of Liones, the Seven Deadly Sins and their allies Elizabeth and Hawk hoped to finally enjoy peaceful lives. However, premonitions of a looming new threat seem destined to disrupt their happy days. Though the warriors indulge in lighthearted adventures - Ban and Meliodas settle an old score, King and Diane share a sweet date, Merlin tries her hand at waitressing, Gowther makes a new friend - they remain alert. Their defeated enemies slowly recover their strength, likely plotting revenge. Still, the Sins relish the calm before the next storm. From humorous mishaps to rekindled friendships, they create treasured memories together. But the promise of future chaos lingers, hinting at an epic Holy War that could once again plunge Liones into strife. Though the Sins now fight for peace, their next battle may soon arrive at their doorstep.",
