  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Blood will spill and hearts will pound as twelve formidable warriors, each bearing the name and essence of a Chinese Zodiac sign, gather for the ruthless Twelve Tournament—an event that occurs only once every twelve years. The battlefield is set in a deserted city, eerily devoid of its previous inhabitants. The stakes are high: the victor will be granted a single wish, no matter the desire. But there's a deadly twist—each warrior has consumed a lethal gem, adding a ticking clock to the already treacherous battle. As they engage in a fierce fight to the death, who will emerge as the sole survivor? Prepare for a gripping, soul-stirring battle royale that will leave you on the edge of your seat.",
