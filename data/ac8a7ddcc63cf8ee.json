    "text": "Captain Tsubasa J brings back the thrilling football adventures of Captain Tsubasa, with the first 33 episodes recapping his previous exploits. The story then unfolds with the introduction of a formidable new talent, Shingo Aoi, an Italian-based player. As the World Cup kicks off, spectators are treated to a dazzling array of matches, including Tsubasa's face-off against the notorious \"football cyborg,\" Carlos Santana, while representing FC SÃ£o Paulo. With newcomers like Sweden, Thailand, and Uzbekistan joining the fray, the series promises a global spectacle of football action. However, fans are left hanging as the anime concludes mid-tournament, following Japan's match against Uzbekistan. Will our heroes claim the coveted World Cup trophy? Only time will tell.",
