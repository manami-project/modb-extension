  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Other worldly beings and humans coexist in a chaotic, post-apocalyptic world, where lawlessness prevails, and order is hard to maintain. In the bustling city of Shinjuku, a diverse team of bounty hunters known as the Hyper Police is determined to bring criminals to justice. Among them is Sasahara Natsuki, a half-human, half-nekomata, who navigates the complexities of both societies while upholding the law. Alongside her loyal werewolf partner Batanen, who harbors unspoken feelings for her, and the enigmatic nine-tailed fox demon Sakura, who has ulterior motives involving Natsuki, they work tirelessly to protect the citizens. In this tumultuous world, the Hyper Police faces competition from other law enforcement groups, including the all-human MAD Police, as they strive to make a difference and foster understanding between humans and beasts.",
