To combat the threat, the Jerran army created the Most Dangerous Soldiers (MDS), elite warriors with extraordinary abilities. Among them is Geist, a genetically engineered soldier with an insatiable thirst for battle. Due to his uncontrollable nature, Geist is cryogenically frozen and locked away in an orbital satellite.\n\nWhen the satellite crashes back onto Jerra, Geist awakens to find the planet on the brink of destruction. A doomsday device, known as Death Force, threatens to annihilate all life on the war-torn world.
