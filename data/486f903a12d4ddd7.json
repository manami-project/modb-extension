Enter Kate Hoshimiya, a seemingly ordinary girl who orchestrates a grand scheme to conquer the world. Her audacious plan, known as the Zvezda Plot, shocks the world with its fearsome and glorious execution.\n\nAsuta Jimon, a middle school student who has run away from home, finds himself in a desperate situation with no food or shelter. His fortunes change when he encounters Kate, who offers him a place in her secret society, Zvezda, in exchange for his loyalty. Asuta, now a member of Zvezda, learns that their mission to conquer the world is no child's play. The group faces various challenges, from eliminating smokers to dealing with internal mishaps caused by their own members.\n\nDespite the oddities of the organization, Asuta soon realizes that Zvezda is a real force to be reckoned with, equipped with advanced technology and a diverse team of eccentric members. With powerful adversaries like White Light and the Japanese government standing in their way, can Zvezda truly achieve their ambitious goal of world domination and let their light shine across the land?",
