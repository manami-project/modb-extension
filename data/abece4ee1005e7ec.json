  "synopsis": {
    "text": "His name is Yukiya, a seemingly unremarkable second son of a regional leader in the North territory of Yamauchi, a world inhabited by the mythical three-legged crows known as Yatagarasu. Despite his lackluster academic performance and subpar swordsmanship, Yukiya finds himself unexpectedly chosen to serve the Imperial Prince. As he navigates the intricate labyrinth of the imperial court, he forms an unusual bond with his new master, the next chosen ruler of Yamauchi, Wakamiya.\n\nTheir journey is fraught with danger and intrigue, as they face murder, mysterious drugs, and an invasion from an unforeseen enemy. Yukiya, initially annoyed by his new role, begins to understand his enigmatic master better over time. However, this newfound understanding puts him in the crosshairs of danger, as the power struggle for the throne intensifies.\n\nIn this world of shape-shifting crows and political conspiracies, can Yukiya and Wakamiya save Yamauchi from the looming threats? Only time will tell, as the decision on the next ruler of Yamauchi draws near.",
