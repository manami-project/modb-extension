  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aki Miyagawa, a woman with an unwavering passion for taiko drumming, once left her quaint hometown to chase her dreams in the bustling metropolis of Tokyo. Juggling a rigorous training schedule and a part-time job proved challenging, but Aki's determination never faltered. After 15 years, she finds herself back in her childhood village, tasked with coaching aspiring drummers for an upcoming festival. This project, part of Anime Mirai 2015, is brought to life by J.C.Staff.\n\nAs Aki prepares the next generation of drummers for the local festival, she grapples with her own insecurities and the memories of her strict father, who never fully supported her musical aspirations. The tranquil village she once knew has transformed over the years, losing some of its old-world charm. Amidst these changes, Aki must navigate her complex emotions and anticipate her father's reaction to the musical extravaganza.\n\nRina Satou brings Aki Miyagawa to life, while Kenji Hamada stars as Michio Yoshioka, Aki's former teacher who convinced her to return home. This heartwarming tale of personal growth, tradition, and the power of music promises to captivate audiences.",
