  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As the world faced an unprecedented threat from the depths of the unexplored oceans, the Sirens, a formidable alien force with advanced technology, pushed humanity to unite. The Azur Lane, an alliance of four powerful nations—Eagle Union, Royal Navy, Sakura Empire, and Iron Blood—was formed, leading to a triumphant victory against the common enemy. However, this unity was short-lived as diverging ideologies led to the formation of the Red Axis, a faction comprising Sakura Empire and Iron Blood, which sought to harness the Sirens' technology for their own purposes.\n\nIn this fractured world, Enterprise, a seasoned warrior known as the 'Grey Ghost,' carries the burden of Azur Lane's hope for ending the war. Despite her fear of the ocean and a fragile persona hidden behind her stoic exterior, she continues to fight, believing it to be her sole purpose. Meanwhile, three ships from the union—Javelin, Laffey, and Unicorn—encounter Ayanami, a spy from the Red Axis, and attempt to befriend her against all odds.\n\nAs the conflict between the Azur Lane and the Red Axis intensifies, the key to reuniting humanity may lie in the hands of a soldier grappling with her enigmatic personality and the formation of unlikely friendships between those with opposing ideals. In this never-ending war, the courage and camaraderie of these battleship girls could ultimately determine the fate of a divided world.",
