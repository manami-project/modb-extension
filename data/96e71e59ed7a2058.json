The urban legend speaks of a phantom train that appears only to women in distress, carrying a new ensemble of charming characters who embody the stations of the Oedo Line. Among them are Fumi Roppongi, Rintarou Shinjuku, Izayoi Tsukishima, Iku Shiodome, Saki Tochou, and Itsumi Ryougoku.\n\nAs the tale unfolds, the Miracle Train emerges to aid troubled ladies, from those who have misplaced their pets to those who find it hard to open up about their problems. The gallant men aboard the train, each representing a different station, are committed to resolving the issues that burden their passengers.\n\nIn this captivating narrative, a fortunate woman is granted entry to the Oedo Line platform, where the Miracle Train awaits. As the doors slide open, she discovers an extraordinary space inhabited by six dashing men. The conductor explains that these men, along with a female guide, lead the Miracle Train, which materializes only when women are beset by worries or insecurities. Despite their contrasting personalities, the men share an unbreakable bond, and they are dedicated to alleviating the fears and concerns of those who cross their path.",
