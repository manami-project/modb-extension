This episode takes us back in time to the first encounter between Kuroko and Aomine, as depicted in the 124th chapter of the manga. At this point, Kuroko was on the verge of abandoning basketball, but a pivotal interaction with Aomine changed his course. This OVA promises to shed light on the formative moments that shaped these beloved characters' journeys in the world of basketball.",
