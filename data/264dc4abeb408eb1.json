  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The OVA bundled with the sixth Blu-ray/DVD volume of Kuroko's Basketball 2nd Season focuses on the first meeting of Kuroko and Aomine in middle school. At that time, Kuroko was contemplating quitting basketball, but a chance encounter with Aomine, who was enthralled by Kuroko's unique playstyle, encouraged him to keep playing. The OVA recounts their initial encounter and highlights how Aomine's passion for the game reignited Kuroko's drive, forging a connection that would shape their basketball journeys from that point forward. By depicting this pivotal moment, the OVA provides meaningful backstory into what shaped the relationship between these two major characters.",
