Now a NEET, Kagami spends his days updating his anime blog, much to the dismay of his sister, Suzune. Determined to pull him out of his otaku lifestyle, Suzune secures him a teaching position at their alma mater, Ichou Academy. Despite his initial reluctance, Kagami soon discovers that his unique perspective and unconventional teaching methods may be just what his students need to navigate the complexities of high school and beyond. As he delves deeper into the lives of his pupils, Kagami finds himself drawn into their struggles and triumphs, ultimately realizing that his passion for anime and manga might hold the key to unlocking their true potential.",
