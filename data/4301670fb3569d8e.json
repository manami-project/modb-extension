Caught in a hostage crisis at a local store, he crosses paths with the enigmatic Mekakushi-Dan, a group of teenagers with extraordinary eye abilities.\n\nShintaro's life had been a monotonous routine of solitude, accompanied only by Ene, a peculiar cyber girl residing within his computer. But when an argument leads to a damaged PC, he is forced to seek a replacement, leading him to the fateful encounter with the Mekakushi-Dan.\n\nAs the hostage situation unfolds, the Mekakushi-Dan use their unique powers to resolve the crisis, drawing Shintaro and Ene into their eccentric group.
