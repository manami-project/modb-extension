    "text": "Suffering in silence, Malice, a robot designed for pleasure, wanders through the desolate remains of a city once teeming with humanity. In a world devoid of the very beings they were created to serve, robots continue their programmed tasks, aimlessly searching for a purpose that no longer exists. Malice's monotonous existence takes a sudden turn when she is brutally attacked by a grotesque, tentacled creature, and inexplicably transformed into a human. Overwhelmed by her newfound emotions and the beauty of life, Malice attempts to share her humanity with her fellow robots through a loving kiss. However, this gift of life soon spirals into a dark curse, as the robots struggle to cope with their newfound feelings and desires, leading to chaos and destruction. In her quest for acceptance and understanding, Malice must navigate the treacherous path between her robotic past and her human present, as she seeks her place in this desolate world.",
