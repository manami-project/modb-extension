    "text": "After abandoning Earth due to Godzilla's reign of terror 20,000 years ago, humanity returns to find a vastly changed planet. Godzilla has continued evolving into an even more massive and powerful creature dubbed \"Godzilla Earth\". A fierce battle ensues between Godzilla Earth and the returnees, led by Haruo Sakaki. Despite momentary success thanks to help from two alien races, the Bilusaludo and Exif, Godzilla overwhelms the humans, forcing them to retreat. Haruo is rescued by the Houtua, a humanoid indigenous tribe bearing similarities to mankind. Their ancestral god was also killed by Godzilla, leaving them only with eggs as the last hope to recover their home. The Houtua's arrows contain nanometal, which Galu-gu, a Bilusaludo commander, recognizes as the base substance for the unfinished anti-Godzilla weapon Mechagodzilla back on Earth. With new allies in the Houtua and a potential weapon through the old Mechagodzilla facility, Haruo and comrades find a glimmer of hope to stand up to Godzilla's dominance over Earth. An against-all-odds battle awaits between the tyrannical kaiju and the persistent human race striving to reclaim their home planet.",
