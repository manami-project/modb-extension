Meanwhile, Miorine remains vigilant at the Benerit Group headquarters, closely observing her father's precarious health condition.\n\nAs the echoes of a harrowing terrorist attack on Plant Quetta begin to fade, the shadowy organization responsible, Dawn of Fold, covertly infiltrates the school, jeopardizing Suletta and her friends. Amidst this turmoil, Prospera, Suletta's enigmatic mother, approaches Miorine with an intriguing proposition: to continue 'Quiet Zero,' a project aimed at ending all wars, initiated by Miorine's father.\n\nWith the specter of the Gundam's powerful curse looming, the girls must confront new challenges and make decisions that will irrevocably alter the course of their lives and the future of the Gundams. As they grapple with their feelings, the girls stand resolute, ready to face the trials that await them.",
