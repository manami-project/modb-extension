  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Despite his youth and ambition, Reinhard von MÃ¼sel, serving under the Galactic Empire, is met with disdain from his peers, who believe his position is a result of his sister's influence over the Kaiser. Meanwhile, Yang Wenli, a passive yet capable servant of a corrupt democracy under the Alliance banner, finds himself assigned to an overconfident superior officer following his heroic victory at El Facil. As Reinhard arrives at the Iserlohn Fortress with his fleet, he is ordered to intercept a powerful Alliance fleet in a neighboring star system, leading to a significant encounter. This story, set in a distant and imaginative future, marks the first meeting between Reinhard and Yang, exploring the birth of heroes amidst a 150-year-long conflict. This film serves as a prelude to the extensive TV series, offering a glimpse into the lives of these two galactic heroes as they strive to overcome adversity and earn their place in history.",
