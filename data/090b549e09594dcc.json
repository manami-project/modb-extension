  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows Tsubasa Shiki, a high school student who finds himself relocating from bustling Tokyo to the frosty climes of Kitami City in Hokkaido, thanks to his father's new job. Unaccustomed to the biting cold and sprawling landscapes, Tsubasa encounters a captivating local 'gal' at a bus stop, standing out against the snowy backdrop with her striking hairstyle and bold fashion choices, including bare legs in the freezing weather. Intrigued by her unique style and dialect, Tsubasa is drawn to Minami Fuyuki, a 'Dosanko Gal' who is unlike any girl he's met before. As fate would have it, Minami turns out to be a classmate at his new school, further complicating Tsubasa's desire to reinvent himself and leave his 'loser' reputation behind. Brace yourself for a whirlwind of laughter, love, and stylish outfits as Tsubasa navigates the icy terrains of Hokkaido and the even more challenging social landscape of his new school, all while trying to resist the magnetic pull of Minami's charm.",
