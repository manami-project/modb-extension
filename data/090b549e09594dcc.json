    "text": "Tsubasa is a high school boy who has just moved from Tokyo to the northern city of Kitami in Hokkaido. On his first day, while waiting at a bus stop in the bitter cold, he meets Minami, an outgoing and fashionable local girl wearing a short skirt despite the freezing weather. Though puzzled by her bold style and unusual way of speaking, Tsubasa is immediately intrigued. The next day at his new school, Tsubasa is shocked to find Minami is in his class. As she continues her energetic attempts to befriend him, he struggles to adapt both to the cold climate and Minami's forward personality. However, as he gets to know her and other stylish girls, Tsubasa starts to embrace the charms of Hokkaido life. Between laughing with new friends and exploring the snowy landscape, he realizes there is more to this northern land than just the cold. With Minami's warmth breaking through his reserve, Tsubasa finds himself captivated by the vivacious spirit of the \"Hokkaido gals.\"",
