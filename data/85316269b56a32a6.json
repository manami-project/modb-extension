  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Reiko Mikami, a stunning and money-loving exorcist, leads the charge against malevolent spirits in a world teeming with supernatural entities. As the head of Ghost Sweeper Mikami, she's not your average paranormal detective - she's an extraordinary one, accompanied by her dedicated but perverted assistant, Tadao Yokoshima, and the amiable teenage ghost, Kinu Himuro. From battling oni, yurei, and yokai to thwarting psychotic dolls and bank heists, no job is too bizarre or challenging for this ghost-busting trio. While Tadao hopes for a glimpse of Reiko's alluring figure, she often uses him as a disposable pawn in her dangerous endeavors. Join them as they embark on thrilling and hilarious adventures, investigating paranormal occurrences and putting their lives on the line for the right price.",
