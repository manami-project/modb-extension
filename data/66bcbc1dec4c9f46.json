  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kei Kurono makes an unexpected decision to sacrifice his life to save a homeless man from an oncoming train. But instead of finding peace in the afterlife, Kei awakens in a mysterious room alongside other recently deceased people. There, a giant black orb commands them to hunt down aliens hidden on Earth for a chance to reclaim their lives. Kei reluctantly teams up with his childhood friend Masaru and a woman he's just met. Thrust into a dangerous game against creatures they barely understand, the trio must fight not just for their survival, but to regain their very humanity. However, death is no longer the end - should they fall in battle, the orb resurrects them over and over to continue the vicious game. As the battles grow increasingly brutal, Kei and his companions begin questioning the morality of their actions. But with their lives on the line, they have no choice but to obey the orb's directives. In this sinister game of life and death, there are no winners - only those struggling to hold onto what little mortality they have left.",
