    "text": "Knowing that his life is on the line, Kei Kurono makes an unexpected choice to save a homeless man from an oncoming train, only to meet his own demise. However, he awakens in a mysterious room filled with other recently deceased individuals and a large black sphere. The sphere, known as Gantz, provides them with weapons and strange black suits, instructing them to hunt down aliens hidden among the population. Kei teams up with his childhood friend Masaru Katou and a stranger to navigate this dangerous new world, where death is permanent and the stakes are high. But as they fight against green aliens and robot monsters, Kei realizes that this game is not just a test of his skills and morals, but also his will to survive. Gantz is a brutal and disturbing game, filled with gore, violence, and all the ugliness of society, where death is not the end, but possibly the beginning of something worse.",
