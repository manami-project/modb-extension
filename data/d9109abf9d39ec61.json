  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows Princess Yona and her companions including the four legendary dragon warriors. In one story, the group stops at a hot spring hotel to rest. There, the dragon warrior Ki-ja is troubled by a mark on his back linked to his dragon powers and his complicated relationship with his father, the previous White Dragon. In another lighthearted tale, the group holds a drinking contest where they banter and eventually fall asleep one by one. The dragon warrior Zeno then dreams about his mysterious past, revealing his abilities, experiences, and long life both as a human and as the Yellow Dragon. These stories provide backstories on the dragon warriors' origins and bonds while showing more casual interactions between the endearing cast of characters. With its blend of drama, mystery, and comedic relief all set in an epic fantasy world, this anime promises to tug at the heartstrings while unleashing spectacular dragon action.",
