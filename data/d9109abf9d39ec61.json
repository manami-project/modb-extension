  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Son Hak and his dragon companions find respite in a secluded hot springs lodge, offering Yona and the team a well-deserved break. As the group unwinds, Ki-ja appears uneasy and opts out of the communal bath. Jae-ha, ever the mischievous one, seizes the opportunity to provoke Ki-ja, inadvertently uncovering a birthmark that serves as a poignant reminder of his complex relationship with his father, the former White Dragon.\n\nIn a separate tale, the dragons engage in a lighthearted drinking contest, eventually succumbing to sleep. As they drift off, Zeno is transported back to his past, unveiling his journey as both a person and the formidable Yellow Dragon. These two episodes, along with the subsequent pair, complete the Zeno Arc, originally bundled with the 21st and 22nd volumes of Mizuho Kusanagi's manga.\n\nPrepare to embark on a journey filled with camaraderie, introspection, and revelations as Yona and her companions explore their pasts and forge new bonds. This captivating adaptation brings to life the bonus chapters from the 12th manga volume, promising an engaging and enlightening experience for both new and returning fans.",
