    "text": "In the realm of dreams and reality, Yumeji Fujiwara, an ordinary high school student, finds himself anything but ordinary. Equipped with an extraordinary ability to perceive other people's dreams, Yumeji's once entertaining talent takes a dark turn as his own dreams become a nightmarish battlefield. Pursued relentlessly by an army of cats led by the enigmatic Chaser John Doe, Yumeji learns that his body is the key for this dream demon to enter the real world.\n\nAs the line between reality and dreams blurs even further, Yumeji encounters Merry Nightmare, an amnesiac dream demon seeking a way back to her own realm. With her presence signifying a breach between the two worlds, Yumeji and Merry form an unlikely alliance to fend off the impending invasion of dream demons, turning their everyday lives into a series of thrilling, dream-infused battles. As they gather the necessary clues to send Merry home, they must confront the sinister forces that threaten to materialize everyone's worst nightmares into reality. Join Yumeji and Merry as they embark on a fantastical journey to restore the balance between the Dream World and the Real World.",
