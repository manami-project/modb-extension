    "text": "Conan looks forward to a relaxing evening reading a large stack of borrowed manga, but his plans are interrupted when Kogoro receives a request to protect a treasured sword from the phantom thief Kaitou Kid. The Mine family believes Kid aims to steal their prized possession from their dojo. Upon arriving at the dojo with Kogoro and the Detective Boys, Conan meets Yaiba Kurogane, a young swordsman. Though the Mines insist they can handle Kid themselves, Conan and the others join forces to defend against the elusive thief's plot. As Conan scrutinizes the peculiar details surrounding the heist note, he suspects there may be more to this case than meets the eye. Will they be able to keep the sword out of Kid's grasp? Conan is determined to uncover the truth behind the thief's surprise target and motive.",
