    "text": "This anime takes place in the rural American West and Paris. The story begins when there is a brutal attack on a NASA base in Arizona. Soon after, a dead CIA agent is found in the Seine River in Paris. Monsieur Lassar, a French secret service agent, suspects these two events are connected. His investigation leads him to Lamia Vindaw, a famous film star who is the target of a bizarre vampire cult. This cult appears eccentric but is actually extremely vicious and dangerous. Lassar comes to believe that Vindaw holds the key to the mystery behind the attack on the NASA base and the death of the CIA agent. To help unravel the mystery and protect Vindaw, Lassar hires Kousaburo Kuki, an international terrorist, spy and master criminal. Kuki is tasked with getting to the bottom of the vampire cult's sinister plans. However, the vampires prove to be ruthless killers and the body count grows rapidly. Kuki races against time to reveal the truth before he too falls victim to the bloodthirsty cult.",
