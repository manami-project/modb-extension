  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Long ago, all humans lived together in the ocean. However, some desired to live on land and left the sea behind, casting off special raiments granted by the Sea God that allowed them to thrive underwater. This created a divide between the sea dwellers and land dwellers, with differing mindsets and ways of life. Though separated, contact still remained between the two peoples over time. This story follows four middle school students - Hikari, Manaka, Chisaki, and Kaname - who hail from Shioshishio, an undersea village. When their school closes, they attend one on surface land and meet Tsumugu, a fellow student fond of the sea. As the youths adjust to surface life and forge bonds between land and sea, they confront deep-rooted prejudice. They also face inner turmoil - new adolescent feelings, rifts within friendships, family conflicts, and identity crises. Their lives intertwine and change against the backdrop of both a coming-of-age and an impending tempest that threatens people of both surface and sea.",
