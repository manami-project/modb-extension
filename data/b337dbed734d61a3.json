  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Based in the picturesque coastal town of Izu, Iori Kitahara embarks on a new journey as he begins his college life. With dreams of a perfect student experience, he moves into his uncle's diving shop, Grand Blue. However, his expectations of a serene and sociable life are quickly shattered as he encounters a group of rowdy, alcohol-loving students who frequent the shop. Thrown into a whirlwind of wild parties, drinking games, and unexpected camaraderie, Iori finds himself at the center of attention, much to the disapproval of his cousin, Chisa. As he navigates through his unconventional college life, Iori must learn to balance his dreams with the chaotic reality of Grand Blue, while also discovering the joys of scuba diving. Adapted from Kenji Inoue and Kimitake Yoshioka's popular comedy manga, this anime promises a rollercoaster ride of laughter, friendship, and underwater adventures.",
