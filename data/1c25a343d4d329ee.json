While visiting a shrine to pray for luck on an upcoming exam, she stumbles upon a magic spell gone awry and is transported back in time to Japan's Sengoku Era.

Nobunaga believes that acquiring the mythical Crimson Armor will help her achieve her ambition to conquer Japan. A fish out of water, Hide must navigate this strange new world. Despite not knowing why she was brought to this time period, she decides to aid Nobunaga in her quest. Together they set out to find the enchanted armor said to bestow great power upon its wearer. Hide is in store for a wild ride as she experiences life in the warring states.
