    "text": "Yasaburō's life is anything but ordinary, as he navigates the bustling city of Kyoto teeming with humans, tanukis, and tengus. As the third son of the prominent Shimogamo tanuki family, Yasaburō is no stranger to adversity. His father, once the respected leader of the tanuki community, was tragically eaten by a group of humans known as the 'Friday Club'. Now, Yasaburō must balance his carefree nature with the responsibilities of caring for his old tengu master, navigating tense relationships with other tanukis, and unraveling the truth behind his father's untimely demise. All the while, he must avoid the same fate as his father and resist becoming the main ingredient in a human hot pot. With danger lurking around every corner, can Yasaburō find the answers he seeks and maintain his playful spirit in this urban jungle?",
