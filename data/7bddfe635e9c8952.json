As the infected transform into ravenous monsters, the uninfected struggle to survive, with no place to call safe.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Hae-sun, a young runaway, finds herself trapped in the heart of the outbreak. Her estranged father, Suk-gyu, and her desperate boyfriend join forces to find her, navigating the treacherous streets of Seoul. Meanwhile, the government declares a lockdown, leaving the uninfected to fend for themselves against the growing zombie horde.\n\nIn the midst of the crisis, Hye-Seon and Gi-Ung, a struggling couple living in a dilapidated room, find their relationship on the brink of collapse. Desperate for money, Gi-Ung resorts to posting an online ad offering his girlfriend for prostitution, leading to a heated argument and their separation. Hye-Seon's father, alerted to the ad, rushes to help his daughter, only to find himself caught in the city's escalating chaos.\n\nAs Seoul descends into pandemonium, Hye-Seon joins forces with a homeless man, while Gi-Ung and Hye-Seon's father team up in search of her.
