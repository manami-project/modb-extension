    "text": "While out for a stroll, a mother cat and her three kittens chance upon an abandoned kitten named Tora-chan. Feeling pity for the hungry little one, the mother cat shares some milk with Tora-chan and decides to take him home. There, she continues caring for him - providing food, clothes, and playtime. However, the youngest kitten, Miike, grows jealous of all the attention lavished on the new arrival. Stewing in resentment, Miike runs away from home one night. The next morning, when the family discovers Miike's disappearance, Tora-chan is consumed with guilt. Determined to make amends, he sets off alone to find Miike and bring her back safely. Will Tora-chan succeed in his quest to retrieve the runaway Miike? And if so, can he finally earn her acceptance as the newest member of this close-knit feline family?",
