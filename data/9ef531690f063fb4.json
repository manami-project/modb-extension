  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Upon dying and arriving at the purgatorial Train Station, a dejected soul is informed that he has won the chance to be reincarnated by identifying his greatest sin from his previous life. He is placed into the body of Makoto Kobayashi, a 14-year-old boy who recently committed suicide. Watched over by the spirit Purapura, the soul has six months to complete his task of understanding his past sin, while also learning what led Makoto to suicide and finding enjoyment in his unexpected second chance at life. As he adjusts to Makoto’s troubled circumstances, including his fractured family, lack of friends, and the uneasy tension his presence creates, the soul gains perspective into the complex motivations behind people’s actions. He comes to realize how the messy entanglements of human relationships and emotions often hurt others, even when harm is unintended. Ultimately, this colorful cast of characters that touch Makoto’s life aids the soul in his journey toward revelation about his greatest mistake, forgiveness, and rebirth.",
