  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dr. Toyama invents a strange machine that allows someone to take control of another person's body. He convinces a young man named Takao to use the machine to possess the body of Takao's crush, Komaba. At first, Takao revels in exploring Komaba's body in this intimate way. However, his careless actions soon lead to awkward sexual encounters with both Komaba's friend Nakano and Komaba's own brother and friends. Takao gets more than he bargained for, learning difficult lessons about consent and objectification. Though Dr. Toyama meant no harm with his invention, it enables problematic behavior. The story explores complex themes around gender, relationships, and the ethics of advanced technology.",
