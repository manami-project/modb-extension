  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keiichi Morisato is a college student who accidentally dials the wrong number while trying to order takeout food to his dormitory one night. He ends up reaching the Goddess Help Line instead and summons a kind goddess named Belldandy. Not believing she is real, Keiichi jokingly wishes for Belldandy to stay as his girlfriend forever. To his shock, Belldandy happily grants his wish as a binding contract. Keiichi soon realizes Belldandy is indeed a magical goddess when strange occurrences keep happening around her. As per Keiichi's wish, Belldandy remains loyally by his side despite skeptical dorm mates. Eventually Keiichi gets kicked out of student housing for harboring a woman. Homeless, the two move into an old temple where they are later joined by Belldandy's meddlesome yet well-meaning sisters - Urd and Skuld. While living together, Keiichi tries navigating a peculiar relationship with a divine, yet innocently affectionate girlfriend. Wild misadventures ensue as he discovers the true scope of Belldandy's magical abilities while fending off her sisters' cosmic jokes and noisy antics. Throughout it all, Keiichi and Belldandy grow ever closer, linked by supernatural contract and genuine fondness.",
