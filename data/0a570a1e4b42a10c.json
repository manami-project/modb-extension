  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Fantasy and history intertwine in this captivating tale set in a mythical third-century Japan. The narrative follows the young Prince Izumo of Nakatsukuni, who, unlike his studious cousin Dekiru, yearns for adventure beyond his kingdom's borders. One day, his life takes a dramatic turn when he encounters a mysterious girl named Sanae, a stowaway on an airship who hails from the enigmatic Naga people, known for their magical abilities.\n\nWhen Sanae is abducted by Takeru, a warrior from the rival kingdom of Akusa, and falls into the clutches of the malevolent witch Yomihime, Izumo embarks on a daring rescue mission. Joined by Navi, an orphaned glider pilot, Izumo must master the powers of his country's sacred sword to save Sanae. However, before he can reach her, he must confront the legendary eight-headed serpent, Yamata-no-Orochi.\n\nThis anime, based on Tsuzuki Kazuhiko's manga of the same name, is unrelated to the game by Studio e.go and its corresponding anime adaptation. It's a thrilling journey filled with ancient customs, magical powers, and epic battles, all set against the backdrop of a historical Japan teeming with mythical creatures and powerful kingdoms.",
