  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Responsible for the setbacks and triumphs of the Yorozuya, Gintoki Sakata, a former eccentric samurai, finds himself entangled in a war that could determine the fate of Edo. Alongside his apprentice Shinpachi Shimura and the superhumanly strong Kagura, they take on odd jobs to make ends meet and lend a helping hand to those in need. However, Gintoki's dark past has a way of catching up with him.\n\nAs the Altana Liberation Army withdraws from the Kabuki District, the war appears to have taken a turn for the better. Yet, the battle is far from over. Edo's greatest inventor, Gengai Hiraga, has been kidnapped, and his nanomachine virus - responsible for disabling the enemy's weapons - is at risk of being shut down.\n\nMeanwhile, a planet-obliterating laser is activated aboard the Liberation Army's mother ship, orbiting Earth. The Yorozuya and their allies must now fight a two-front war, with Shinsuke Takasugi and the Kiheitai attempting to halt the weapon's firing. The future of Edo and the entire world hangs in the balance, as Gintoki and his friends face their greatest challenge yet.",
