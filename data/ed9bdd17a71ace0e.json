    "text": "After losing his mother and his sight in a series of tragic events, young Takuma Hirose moves from Tokyo to a rural village to live with his uncle. Enrolling in the local high school, Hirose meets three girls who impact his life in different ways. Classmate Hayami Kohinata is bullied and ostracized by their peers for mysterious reasons. The polite Hinata Kagura helps Hirose adjust to his new school but hides contempt toward Kohinata. An enigmatic girl named Otoha, only visible to Hirose, gifts him temporary restoration of sight. As Hirose's medical condition gradually improves, he strives to uncover why Kohinata faces such hostility. He suspects sinister secrets plague the village and is determined to help Kohinata while healing from his own emotional wounds. With empathy and courage, Hirose uses his second chance at sight to transform the lives of these three girls and the village itself.",
