    "text": "One moonlit night, two university professors, Komada and Koshigaya, transform from educators to clandestine biohunters, seeking to eradicate the menacing Demon Virus that plagues Japan. This perilous virus mutates humans into grotesque creatures, but Komada's unique immunity allows him to control his demonic transformations.\n\nWhen Komada stumbles upon a young girl, Sayaka, fleeing from sinister pursuers, he learns she is the granddaughter of a renowned psychic. The psychic has unveiled a dark secret concerning a powerful politician, which has put their lives in jeopardy. Intriguingly, this secret appears to be intertwined with the Demon Virus.\n\nDetermined to protect Sayaka and unravel the truth, Komada and Koshigaya embark on a perilous journey, confronting the politician's ruthless henchmen and the virus itself. As they race against time to find Sayaka's grandfather and learn his prophecy, they must also distribute the cure for the virus, battling both external threats and Komada's inner demon.\n\nThe fate of countless lives rests in the hands of these two courageous biohunters, as they strive to halt the spread of the Demon Virus and bring an end to the chaos it has unleashed.",
