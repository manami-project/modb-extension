  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime \"Milgram\" is an interactive multimedia music collaboration between DECO*27 and Takuya Yamanaka, featuring 11 music videos. The story unfolds in a mysterious prison where ten inmates, all accused of murder, are under the watchful eyes of a guard and a mythical creature, the jackalope. Each inmate is given the chance to confess their sins and crimes through a music video performance. As viewers, you assume the role of the guard, tasked with determining the truth behind their confessions. After each performance, you must decide if the inmate is \"guilty\" or \"innocent,\" leading the narrative down different paths. The anime invites viewers to engage in a moral dilemma, questioning the lines between right and wrong, and the role of forgiveness in justice.",
