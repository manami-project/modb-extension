  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story takes place after the events of the Maison Ikkoku TV series and does not include the summary episode. It centers around the tenants of Maison Ikkoku throwing a party to celebrate the marriage of Yusaku Godai and Kyoko Otonashi. However, during the festivities, Yusaku overhears that Kyoko is awaiting a letter, which makes him jealous and doubtful about her feelings. He worries that she still loves someone else. The next morning, the truth behind Kyoko's letter is revealed, presumably resolving Yusaku's concerns about her commitment to him and their marriage. Though details are sparse, the film seems to focus on the couple navigating communication issues and reaffirming their devotion amidst the well-meaning interference of their eccentric but close-knit boarding house community.",
