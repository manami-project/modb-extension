  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tokyo, now known as MegaTokyo, is on the mend in the year 2032 after a catastrophic earthquake left it in ruins. The reconstruction is largely attributed to Boomers, advanced androids capable of performing tasks ranging from manual labor to military operations. However, these androids pose a threat as they frequently malfunction and turn against their human creators. The monolithic corporation GENOM, responsible for Boomer technology, harbors a covert ambition to dominate the world.\n\nAs traditional law enforcement struggles to contain the rogue Boomers, hope emerges in the form of the Knight Sabers. This formidable team of four young women, each equipped with state-of-the-art hardsuits, stands as the city's best defense against the rampaging androids and the corporation pulling their strings. The Knight Sabers, led by Sylia Stingray, Priscilla 'Priss' Asagiri, Nene Romanova, and Linna Yamazaki, are the only force capable of confronting the Boomers and safeguarding the citizens of MegaTokyo. Will their courage and firepower be enough to thwart GENOM's sinister plans and protect the city from the Boomer menace?",
