  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kazushi is a university student living with his childhood friends, sisters Ayane and Kotone. Having grown up together, they share a close familial bond. One day, Ayane discovers Kazushi using her special bath salts without permission. Angered, she and Kotone decide to join him in the bath to get back at him. As the three share the intimate space, latent feelings between them begin to surface. Though taken aback at first, Kazushi starts to see the sisters in a new romantic light. Likewise, Ayane and Kotone become aware of their own secret affection for Kazushi. What started as a childish prank thus sparks an exploration of their complicated relationship. Will these longtime friends pursue romance and transform their bond into something more? Or will they let awkwardness push them apart rather than bring them together? Their future hangs in the delicate balance as this comedic drama unfolds. Full of playful antics and meaningful connections, the story captures the thrill and confusion of young love blossoming unexpectedly between friends. As tensions build in the steamy bathhouse, viewers are left wondering whether these three can emerge closer than ever or if their ties will be severed for good.",
