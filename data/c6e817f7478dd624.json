    "text": "She was saved by a creature of the night, only to find herself entwined in a world of darkness and secrets ten years later. Yuuki Cross, adopted daughter of the Cross Academy's headmaster, is no ordinary student. Alongside her childhood friend, Zero Kiryuu, they serve as guardians, maintaining order and protecting a dangerous secret: the Night Class is composed of vampires.\n\nAs the Day Class returns to their dorms at twilight, they cross paths with the Night Class, a group of impossibly beautiful and elite students. While Yuuki admires these creatures of the night, Zero harbors a deep-seated hatred for them, fueled by a tragic past.\n\nIn this delicate balance, Yuuki finds herself drawn to Kaname Kuran, the leader of the Night Class and the vampire who once saved her. But as tensions rise and the true nature of the vampires is questioned, can this fragile coexistence survive? Or will the price of trust prove to be deadlier than the vampires themselves? In a world where nothing is as it seems, one thing is certain: the truth is always lurking in the shadows.",
