  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When Qin Huai opens his eyes, he finds himself transported to a fantasy world and bound to a system that claims he can become the ruler. Skeptical yet intrigued, Qin resigns himself to fully immerse in this new world. He works hard day and night, earning points to unlock divine weapons, precious treasures, powerful skills, and even gain a gentle junior sister. On the surface, Qin pretends to be aimless, but secretly he cultivates intensely, quickly surpassing all the other sect members. He even accidentally saves the entire sect at one point! However, danger lurks - the sect elders plot to assassinate Qin, the demonic Heavenly Demon Sect launches an attack, and the four allied sects of the Immortal Alliance break apart and turn on each other. As threats close in, Qin must grasp the power of the system to conquer foes, mend rifts between allies, and dominate this fantasy world.",
