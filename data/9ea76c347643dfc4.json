    "text": "As Akihito Kanbara, a half-human, half-youmu, tries to move on with life after a hard-won battle against the formidable Beyond the Boundary, he is faced with an unexpected challenge: Mirai Kuriyama, the Spirit World Warrior who once fought alongside him, has lost all memory of their shared past. Desperate to protect her newfound normalcy, Akihito keeps his distance, even as Mirai, unaware of her own history, seeks to reconnect with him.\n\nA year after the events of the original series, Akihito, now in his senior year, grapples with the bittersweet pain of watching Mirai navigate the world without the burden of her past. But when a mysterious new threat emerges, intent on seeking out Mirai, Akihito must prepare to defend not only himself and his friends but also the bespectacled girl he cherishes.\n\nAs the darkness closes in, Mirai's forgotten memories begin to resurface, forcing her to confront her past and the cursed blood that once defined her. With the stakes higher than ever, Akihito and Mirai find themselves drawn together once more, embarking on a battle that will test the limits of their strength and determination. In this thrilling continuation of their story, they must fight to protect what they hold most dear and, perhaps, rediscover the bond that once united them.",
