    "text": "After defeating a powerful supernatural threat, Akihito Kanbara believed his friend Mirai Kuriyama had disappeared for good. But a year later, they reunite under unexpected circumstances - Mirai has lost all memories of Akihito and their shared experiences battling supernatural forces. Akihito is devastated that Mirai no longer remembers their bond, but also sees this as an opportunity for her to live a normal life free from the dangers of their past. He and their friends agree to keep Mirai's supernatural origins secret from her for the sake of her happiness. However, Akihito struggles to avoid befriending Mirai again. Soon, troubling memories from Mirai's forgotten past start resurfacing. Additionally, shadowy supernatural creatures with mysterious goals begin prowling their city looking for Mirai. As threats mount, Akihito realizes he must fight to protect both Mirai's future and the cherished memories they lost - even if it means her remembering the painful truths from which he had hoped to shelter her. With Mirai's safety at stake, Akihito and his allies prepare for a new battle in which Mirai may be forced to rediscover her dangerous former self.",
