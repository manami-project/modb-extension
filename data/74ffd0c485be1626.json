    "text": "Together, Ayato Kamina, an ordinary high school student, and the mysterious RahXephon, a powerful humanoid weapon, hold the key to saving a devastated world. In 2012, Tokyo was suddenly attacked by the Mu, beings from another dimension with blue blood. Three years later, amidst an assault on Tokyo by futuristic fighter jets, Ayato's life takes a dramatic turn. He meets the enigmatic Reika Mishima, who leads him to the Room of Rah, where the RahXephon is hatched. As Ayato discovers his unique ability to synchronize with RahXephon, he becomes the center of a conflict between the Mu and TERRA, a military organization determined to save humanity.\n\nWith his mother injured and his old life shattered, Ayato must navigate this new reality, grappling with altered memories and the true extent of his power. As the only person capable of controlling RahXephon, Ayato is thrust into a struggle to preserve his own humanity and decide the fate of the world. With Tokyo sealed in a time rift and the Earth's population decimated, Ayato and RahXephon embark on a journey to protect the remnants of Japan and prevent further destruction at the hands of the Mulians. Joined by Haruka Shitow, a member of TERRA, Ayato must confront the truth about his identity and unlock his full potential to save the world from being 'tuned' by the Mu.",
