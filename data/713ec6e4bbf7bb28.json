    "text": "Earthâ€™s legendary Space Battleship Yamato has returned, and three years have passed since its heroic voyage. The planet, now restored to its former glory with the Cosmo Reverse System, has forged a new peace with the Garmillas. The Earth's defense fleet has expanded, boasting the cutting-edge battleship Andromeda. Despite Starsha Iscandar's desire for peace, Earth's military power grows, all while the Yamato's crew members go their separate ways.\n\nHowever, a cryptic message from the enigmatic Goddess Teresa calls the crew back to their beloved ship. The universe is under attack by the ruthless Gatlantis Empire, and Earth is their next target. The crew, unable to ignore Teresa's plea, reunites and embarks on a treacherous journey to the distant planet Terezart. There, they hope to find the power to combat the impending threat and protect their newly rebuilt home.\n\nAs the first of seven films in the Uchuu Senkan Yamato 2202 series, this story follows the Yamato and its crew as they face a new enemy and navigate the delicate balance between peace and military expansion. With the galaxy's fate hanging in the balance, the crew must once again rise to the challenge and prove their courage against an even greater adversary.",
