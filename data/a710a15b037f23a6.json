    "text": "Fujiwara Megumi is a beautiful and popular high school girl who harbors a selfish and violent streak behind her looks. She dates Matsumoto Masamune, an attractive and athletic boy who matches her self-centered nature. Though openly in a relationship, Megumi frequently flirts with and exploits other boys in cruel power plays, leaving the victims hurt physically by her or her jealous boyfriend. \n\nSurrounded by a cast of quirky classmates, Megumi and Masamune's tumultuous relationship leads to no shortage of outlandish and comedically tragic situations around school. Through it all, the couple stays together, caught up in their own egoistic games.",
