Amidst the wild and unconventional romance, the pair and their classmates find themselves in a whirlwind of comedic and tragicomic situations, making their typical high school life anything but ordinary. Prepare for a school comedy filled with unexpected twists, blue humor, and a dash of violence, as Megumi and Masamune navigate the tumultuous waters of love and friendship.",
