    "text": "The story follows the Straw Hat Pirates as they come across an intriguing treasure map while sailing the seas. It hints at a wish-granting treasure hidden in the \"navel of the ocean\", prompting an enthusiastic Luffy and crew to investigate. Their search leads them to a whirlpool containing a mysterious underwater cavern. While Nami, Sanji and Usopp go below to explore, disaster strikes as they are attacked by a monstrous giant octopus, guarding the cavern. Meanwhile, Luffy and Zoro get swept into a nearby abandoned town plagued by destructive sea monsters. They learn these creatures were unleashed by the villainous Captain Joke, who broke a seal on a mountain attempting to acquire the same treasure. Intent on defeating the monsters and helping the townspeople, Luffy heads to the mountain, unaware that each monster he defeats aids in Captain Joke's resurrection. With his friends under attack below and the number of adversaries above only growing, Luffy is caught between dangerous obstacles. But the lure of the wish-granting prize keeps him fighting onward, determined to overcome these threats and unravel the treasure's secrets.",
