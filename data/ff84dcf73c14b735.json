  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The OVA episodes adapt chapters 48 and 49 from the manga, providing additional anime content for fans. Initially, Yuiga goes on a pretend date with Asumi at the beach, keeping up appearances for her father. Though awkward at first, the two ultimately have fun together. Later, Yuiga encounters his teacher, Mafuyu Kirisu, who is hiding out to avoid her colleagues after accidentally losing her bikini top to some mischievous dolphins. This creates another compromising situation for the honorable Yuiga. Overall, the OVA provides humor and fanservice as Yuiga navigates suggestive but innocent mishaps with the ladies in his life. Though he aims to act appropriately, circumstances seem to conspire against him. Nevertheless, the episodes offer entertainment and insight into relationships from the original manga.",
