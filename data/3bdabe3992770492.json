  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Erika, a princess from a magical realm, embarks on a mission to Earth in search of a human girl who bears a striking resemblance to her. The girl in question is Himeko Nonohara, a tomboy who yearns for beauty and popularity. Erika bestows upon Himeko a magical ribbon, a creation of her own, that possesses the power to transform Himeko into anyone she desires. However, the transformation comes with a caveat: if Himeko fails to revert to her original form within an hour, she risks losing her memory and being trapped in the new form indefinitely. Moreover, if she doesn't use the ribbon within a year, Erika stands to lose her claim to the magical throne.\n\nAccompanied by her now-sentient stuffed lion, Himeko embarks on a series of adventures, using her newfound ability to draw closer to her crush, Hasekura. However, fate has other plans as she crosses paths with Daichi, a mischievous boy who discovers her secret. As Himeko navigates through the complexities of her new life, she finds herself unexpectedly drawn towards Daichi, setting the stage for a blossoming romance.",
