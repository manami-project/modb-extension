  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Amamiya Manami, a spirited and determined teenager, arrives at Seioh Private High School in the year 2035, an era when declining birth rates have forced numerous schools to shut their doors due to insufficient student enrollment. As schools struggle to maintain their relevance and traditions, Manami takes on the challenge of reinvigorating Seioh's dwindling spirit.\n\nUpon her transfer, Manami's infectious enthusiasm and unique approach to life quickly catch the attention of her classmates. With her unwavering motto of \"go straight forward,\" she sets her sights on the vacant student council president position. Despite initial resistance from the headmistress, Manami's heartfelt rendition of the school anthem at an assembly ultimately secures her the role.\n\nJoined by fellow student council member Mika Inamori and three other classmates, Manami embarks on a mission to breathe new life into the school. Together, they revamp the student council room and begin planning for the upcoming student festival. As they work to restore Seioh's vitality, Manami and her friends strive to rekindle the joy of learning and school life among their peers.",
