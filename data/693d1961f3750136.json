    "text": "In the year 2035, Japan is facing a declining birth rate, putting many schools in danger of closure due to lack of students. One such school is the all-girls Seioh Private High School, which has seen falling enrollment and school spirit. Enter the cheerful and energetic Manami \"Manabi\" Amamiya, a new transfer student. Despite Seioh's somber state, Manabi resolves to revive the school, starting with taking on the vacant student council president position. Though initially denied by the headmistress, Manabi soon wins her over with a passionate impromptu performance of the school anthem. As student council president, Manabi assembles a team including fellow student Mika Inamori and classmates Mutsuki Uehara, Mei Etoh, and Momoha Odori. Together, they set out to bring new life to Seioh through event planning and remodeling the student council room. With her spirited vision and \"straight ahead\" motto, Manabi is determined to remind the students of Seioh why their school is worth caring about.",
