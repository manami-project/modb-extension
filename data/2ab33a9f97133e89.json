  "synopsis": {
    "text": "He was once a formidable adventurer, known as Belgrieve, but a fateful encounter with a beast cost him his leg and his career. Seeking tranquility, he settled in a quaint village, vowing to safeguard it from any impending threats. One day, while wandering in the woods, he discovered an abandoned child, who he affectionately named Angeline. As she grew older, Belgrieve imparted his wisdom and combat skills to her, igniting a spark in Angeline to follow in her father's footsteps.\n\nWith a heavy heart, Belgrieve sent Angeline to the capital to chase her dreams of becoming a renowned adventurer. Five years later, Angeline had risen to the esteemed S-Rank, earning the moniker of the Black-Haired Valkyrie. Despite her success, she never forgot her roots, often regaling others with tales of her father, the Red Ogre. However, her newfound status came with a price, as she found herself entangled in a series of assignments that prevented her from returning home.\n\nAs Belgrieve anxiously awaits his daughter's return, he wonders if the day will come when he can once again embark on thrilling adventures with his beloved daughter by his side. Will Angeline triumph over the sinister forces that obstruct her path back home? Only time will tell if their dreams of reuniting and adventuring together will come to fruition.",
