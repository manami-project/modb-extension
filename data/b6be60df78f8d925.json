  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a dystopian future, humanity has lost control over the sprawling technological metropolis they created. Endless levels of chaotic, meaningless structures spread in all directions, built by out-of-control machines known as Constructors. Humans struggle to survive, haunted by cyborg entities and the city's defensive Safeguard system that ruthlessly hunts them down. In this grim setting, a young girl named Zuru ventures out seeking food for her struggling community. When the Safeguard detects her, brutal machines attack, leaving her companions dead. As Zuru faces imminent demise, a mysterious wanderer named Killy appears and annihilates the Safeguard with his powerful gravitational beam emitter. Although suspicious of his motives, Zuru and her people have no choice but to join Killy on his quest across the devastated levels. He seeks the Net Terminal Genes, a genetic trait with the potential to restore humanity's control over their lost civilization. This glimmer of hope might be the key to shutting down the Safeguard's extermination protocol and ending the Constructor's chaotic, unchecked expansion across the stars. But the journey ahead is filled with silicon enemies determined to quash any chance for the future of humankind.",
