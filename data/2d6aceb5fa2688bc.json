    "text": "After the tragic events at Marineford, Monkey D. Luffy finds himself stranded on Rusukaina Island to train under Silvers Rayleigh's guidance for two years. Seeking to master the mysterious power known as \"Haki,\" Luffy commits to intense training on the dangerous island filled with giant creatures. His regime is interrupted when the infamous pirate Byrnndi World, having recently escaped from Impel Down's maximum security Level 6, kidnaps Boa Hancock's sisters to lure her into a trap. With Hancock's help, Luffy confronts Byrnndi, who intends to challenge the World Government by taking down one of their powerful Shichibukai allies. Using his developing Haki abilities and Boa Hancock's support, Luffy battles Byrnndi World to rescue her sisters and stop the dangerous criminal's rampage. Through this ordeal, Luffy continues moving forward from his grief over losing his brother Ace and grows stronger to face the challenges that await in the New World.",
