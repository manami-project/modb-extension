    "text": "Shuranosuke Sakaki, a lone samurai with unparalleled swordsmanship, roams the ancient feudal Japan ruled by powerful Shogun clans. Marked by the emblem of two crossed scythes, he is a fearsome figure known as the 'Scythes of Death.' Unyielding and fiercely independent, Shuranosuke's prowess with the katana is legendary, leaving a chilling trail of death in his wake.\n\nWhen the Nakura Clan seeks his expertise to save Princess Mayu from the ruthless Seki Ninja, Shuranosuke must summon his full combat potential. The Seki Ninja, infamous for their malevolent tactics, will stop at nothing to thwart his mission, even summoning the spirits of the underworld. As Shuranosuke embarks on this perilous journey, he must confront formidable adversaries and supernatural forces to fulfill his duty and rescue the captive princess. The path ahead is fraught with danger, but the masterless samurai is undeterred, ready to leave a blood-soaked trail in his relentless pursuit.",
