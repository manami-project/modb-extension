    "text": "She was unwanted, unloved, and abandoned - a young girl named Chise Hatori, whose life had been a cruel tapestry of neglect and despair. At the tender age of fifteen, she sells herself into slavery, desperate to find a place she can call home. Her world takes a dramatic turn when she is bought by a mysterious, skull-faced entity at an auction. This enigmatic being, Elias Ainsworth, sweeps Chise off to his English countryside home, a place brimming with magical creatures and ancient lore.\n\nElias, a powerful magus, reveals that Chise is not only destined to be his apprentice in the mystical arts but also his future bride. As Chise navigates her new life amidst talking animals, dragons, and faeries, she embarks on a journey of self-discovery and magical exploration under the tutelage of her peculiar new guardian.\n\nChise's story unfolds as she learns to adapt to her new life and embrace her destiny as the apprentice and bride of the ancient magus. The first three episodes of this enchanting tale were premiered at the Anime Expo 2017 in Los Angeles, offering viewers a captivating glimpse into Chise's extraordinary new world.",
