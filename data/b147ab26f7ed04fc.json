    "text": "And so begins the epic saga of Knights of the Zodiac: Saint Seiya, where young warriors known as Knights are sworn to protect the reincarnated Greek goddess Athena. Each knight dons a powerful armor, inspired by their chosen zodiac constellation, and together they stand against the malevolent Olympian gods who threaten the very existence of humanity.\n\nSeiya, a determined young boy, journeys to Greece to train as a Saint and earn his very own Sacred Cloth. Upon completion of his training, he receives the Bronze Cloth, the lowest rank among the Saints, and is bestowed with the guardian star of Pegasus. As Saints from all corners of the globe gather for the Galactic War, a championship to determine the ruler of the Saints, Seiya and his fellow Bronze Cloth warriors find themselves in the midst of a fierce battle.\n\nHowever, the tournament takes a dark turn when Phoenix, the Black Saint, emerges and seizes the coveted Gold Cloth, symbolizing the ruler of the Saints, with aspirations of world domination. It is now up to Seiya and his allies to confront Phoenix and his Shadow Army, retrieve the stolen Gold Cloth, and restore peace to the world.\n\nJoin Seiya and the Knights of the Zodiac in this thrilling 12-episode reimagining of the classic Saint Seiya series, as they embark on a heroic journey to defend Athena and protect humanity from the wrath of the Olympian gods.",
