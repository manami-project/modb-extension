    "text": "We've been friends since childhood, Izuru and I. He's always been the bossy one, and I, the one who reluctantly follows his lead. When our school festival play needed a script, I took the task, hoping it would keep me away from Izuru's commanding presence as the lead prince. But fate had other plans. The princess fell ill, and I found myself stepping into her shoes. The final scene required a kiss, a mere act, or so I thought. As the curtains drew close, our lips met, a real kiss, not a pretend one. Despite knowing it was Izuru, in that moment, he transformed into a charming prince, and I couldn't help but notice his unexpected allure.",
