  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a catastrophic alien invasion wipes out 90% of humanity, the remaining survivors are forced to live in shelters, their memories of the disaster erased and their lives closely monitored. In this seemingly peaceful existence, three unsuspecting teenagers are chosen to pilot three powerful machines made of a unique material called Megatronium alloy. These machines can combine to form the mighty Musashi robot, which the young pilots must use to battle against the alien force known as the Dracters. As they navigate the challenges of everyday school life and high-stakes robot battles, these chosen ones fight for the future of humanity and the hope of reclaiming their lost world.",
