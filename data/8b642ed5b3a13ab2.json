    "text": "Team TRY FIGHTERS is set to take on the Gunpla Battle Championship in this thrilling anime, set seven years after Sei Iori's victory in the 7th World Tournament. Now managed by Yajima Trading, the popular game has introduced new rules and battle modes, making it more widespread than ever. However, Seiho Academy, once attended by Sei Iori, has failed to keep up with the trend. The Gunpla Battle Club at the academy is on the brink of extinction, with Fumina Hoshino being its sole member. To participate in the upcoming All-Japan Gunpla Battle Championship, where teams of three are required, Fumina must recruit two more members. Enter Sekai Kamiki, a young martial artist and transfer student, and Yuuma Kousaka, a talented Gunpla builder. Together, they form Team TRY FIGHTERS, ready to face the challenges and triumphs of the Gunpla Battle Championship.",
