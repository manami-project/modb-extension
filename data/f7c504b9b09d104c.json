    "text": "Using an army of soldiers armed with advanced weaponry, Nobunaga Oda is on the brink of ruling Japan with an iron fist in the year 1580. Among his enforcers is Ginnai Doma, a fallen samurai reborn as an indestructible killing machine, who continues to wreak havoc on ninjas and those who oppose Nobunaga's rule. Shishimaru of the Iga Ninja, defying the Koga Ninja's plans, embarks on a solo mission to avenge his comrades' deaths and kill the immortal warrior. But as Shishimaru and other powerful fighters attempt to take down Ginnai, they uncover a web of alien, cyborg, and strange technology involvement. From the creator of Devilman and Cutey Honey, Go Nagai, comes a brutal tale of betrayal, vengeance, and otherworldly forces. With the clans on the verge of destruction, one ninja takes on the seemingly impossible task: kill the immortal Ginnai.",
