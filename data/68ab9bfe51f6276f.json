    "text": "Ren Uesugi and his sister Mihato flee their abusive home life and move to the city seeking employment and shelter. Struggling financially, they have a chance encounter with Miyu Kuonji, inventor daughter of the prestigious Kuonji family. Impressed by the immense Kuonji estate, the siblings accept live-in servant positions in the household alongside fellow staff members. Though initially daunted by the demanding personalities of Miyu and her sisters Shinra and Yume, Ren and Mihato resolve to become the best butler and maid they can be. From navigating inappropriate attractions to participating in zany house games, serving the Kuonji sisters proves no easy task. Yet with camaraderie from the loyal head butler, head maid, and other servants, the two persevere in hopes of building a brighter future.",
