    "text": "Tsumugi Inuzuka, a young girl, and her father, Kouhei, a math teacher, find themselves navigating life's challenges after the tragic loss of their beloved wife and mother. Struggling with culinary skills and a busy teaching schedule, Kouhei finds it difficult to provide wholesome, home-cooked meals for Tsumugi, resorting to convenience store meals instead.\n\nA twist of fate brings them to the doorstep of a local restaurant owned by Kotori Iida, one of Kouhei's students. The restaurant, often closed due to Kotori's mother's work commitments, becomes a shared space for the trio to explore the art of cooking and the joy of sharing meals.\n\nAs Kouhei and Tsumugi embark on this culinary journey with Kotori, they discover the true essence of family, the value of a home-cooked meal, and the warm bonds that are formed over shared food. This heartwarming tale of a single father's love for his daughter, a student's longing for companionship, and their collective passion for cooking promises to serve up a delightful and poignant narrative.",
