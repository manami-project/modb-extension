  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Familiar faces return in \"Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san (2018),\" a series of specials following the conclusion of \"Yuuna and the Haunted Hot Springs.\" The ghostly Yuna and the feline deity Yaya continue their escapades with Kogarashi, often shedding their garments. A mishap occurs when Kogarashi is transformed into a bar of soap by Koyuzu, leading to some unusual scenarios during the communal bathing in the onsen. These specials are bundled with specific volumes of the Yuragi-sou no Yuuna-san manga, with the first episode mirroring the 12th chapter of the manga. The final special adapts both the 99th chapter, 'Noroware no Kogarashi,' and the 141st chapter, 'Giri Giri!? Onsen Happening.'",
