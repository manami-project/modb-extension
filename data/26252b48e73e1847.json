    "text": "The movie centers around a pivotal soccer match between an All-Europe team and an All-Japan team. It takes place at the conclusion of the first TV series of Captain Tsubasa, as the Japanese squad travels to Europe. Upon arrival, the Japanese players quickly realize they are up against world-class competition boasting unmatched skills and strength. The All-Europe roster features legendary talents, including captain Karl-Heinz Schneider, the seemingly unstoppable striker from Germany. The match itself is an intense affair. Shortly after kickoff, the Tachibana brothers from the Japanese side successfully pull off their signature 'acrobatic soccer' maneuver to score an early goal. However, the Europeans demonstrate superior organization and coordination, proving to be a formidable opponent on their home turf. With the established soccer powerhouses of Europe posing a steep challenge, the Japanese squad faces an uphill battle to compete on the global stage. The movie captures this ultimate showdown between the two regions' elite talent. With national pride at stake, both teams are determined to claim victory.",
