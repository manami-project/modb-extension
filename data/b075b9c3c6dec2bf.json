    "text": "Through the expansive void of space in the year 311 of the Orbital Calendar, humans have established a new way of life in sprawling colony clusters. In this era, Akiha Shishidou, a seemingly aimless girl from the affluent Shishidou family, finds her mundane existence taking a dramatic turn when she crosses paths with Leopard, an enigmatic and slightly unhinged artificial intelligence.\n\nWith the help of an elusive young girl named Honoka, Akiha embarks on a thrilling and perilous journey to restore Leopard, all while evading the watchful eyes of the Inter-Colony Police. As Akiha navigates through this whirlwind of excitement and danger, she discovers that her life is entwined with a sinister force lurking in the shadows.\n\nDefying orders from her higher-ups, Inter-Colony Police officer Itsuki Kannagi delves into the mysterious connection between Akiha and Leopard, uncovering a complex web of intrigue. As Akiha struggles to rebuild Leopard amidst the chaos, she begins to realize her true potential as 'The Girl Who Leapt Through Space.'",
