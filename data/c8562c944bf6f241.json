After a lifetime of constant school changes, Kouhei yearns for stability and friendship. However, his dream of a tranquil school life is shattered when he encounters Erika, the eccentric student council vice president, who reveals herself to be a creature of the night. Despite her initial aversion to Koui, he remains determined to form connections and navigate the challenges of his new environment, even if it involves befriending a vampire. Will Kouhei find the sense of belonging he's always craved in this unusual setting, or will the supernatural secrets of his classmates keep him at bay?",
