  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This lighthearted anime commercial celebrates 60 years of Nissin's popular Chicken Ramen noodles. The story follows Hiyoko-chan, the animated mascot for Nissin's Chikin Ramen line, as he enjoys a hot bowl of his favorite noodles. Overcome by the savory flavor, Hiyoko-chan dramatically transforms into his alter ego - the demonic Hiyoko Akuma. With satanic powers, he is determined to obtain more of the delicious ramen he craves. Though played for laughs, Hiyoko-chan's obsession underscores the temptingly addictive taste that has made Chicken Ramen a worldwide hit for over half a century. This playful take on the iconic mascot aims to bring a smile along with a craving for Nissin's products.",
