  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Himiko's curse has plunged the Kanto region into chaos, and the once-unknown attackers from Nara have revealed their connection to the Yamato School. With their leaders Hakufu Sonsaku and Moutoku Sousou already robbed of their Magatama jewels, the fighters of Kanto must join forces with Nanyo, Kyosho, and Seito to launch a counterattack. Gentoku Ryuubi, the last remaining leader with her Magatama intact, leads the charge. However, Hakufu, a fierce street fighter with a penchant for battle, is accidentally left behind at a station on the way to Nara.\n\nAs the Kanto fighters arrive at Yamato Gakuin, they are met by the Kansai fighters, who have been cursed by Himiko's strange spirit. Chouhi, sensing that Ryuubi is in danger, abandons her training to rush to Yamato Gakuin. But the Kanto fighters are no match for Himiko's power, and one by one, they fall. Kan'u and Ryuubi are cornered, and all hope seems lost.\n\nBut in the heat of battle, Chouhi's magatama begins to shine brightly. Will Chouhi awaken in time to save her friends and turn the tide of the battle? The fate of the Kanto fighters hangs in the balance in this action-packed anime filled with fierce battles and ancient warrior spirits.",
