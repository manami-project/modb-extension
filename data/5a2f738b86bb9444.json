    "text": "In a future where humanity is on the brink of annihilation due to the emergence of hostile creatures known as Gadoll, the remnants of society reside in a colossal, mobile fortress named Deca-Dence. This sanctuary houses two classes of inhabitants: the valiant Gears, who engage in daily combat against the Gadoll, and the Tankers, who support the Gears from behind the lines. Natsume, a determined Tanker girl with a prosthetic arm, aspires to join the Gears in their fight. Her life takes an unexpected turn when she crosses paths with Kaburagi, a disillusioned former warrior turned armor repairman. Despite their contrasting outlooks, Natsume's unwavering spirit and Kaburagi's hidden wisdom set them on a path that could alter the destiny of their world.",
