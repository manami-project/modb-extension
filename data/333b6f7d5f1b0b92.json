While on her commute, she is saved from a molester by a pistol-wielding girl, who turns out to be the president of the school's Survival Game Club, Sabagebu!. The club president, Ootori Miou, takes a liking to Momoka and employs questionable tactics to recruit her into the club.\n\nMomoka is hesitant to join the club, which is filled with eccentric members such as Goutokuji Kayo, a cosplay enthusiast, Miou's masochistic childhood friend Kasugano Urara, and part-time model Kyoudou Maya. However, Momoka's natural aptitude for air pistols makes her an ideal candidate for the club's survival games. As she is dragged into a series of bizarre and action-packed events, Momoka must navigate her way through this unconventional club and its even more unconventional members.\n\nWith enemies from rival schools, a determined club shutdown advocate, and even internal club conflicts, Momoka's life at Aogiri Academy High is anything but ordinary. As she learns to adapt to her new surroundings and club members, Momoka might just find that Sabagebu! is where she truly belongs.",
