  "synopsis": {
    "text": "They're hailed as Earth's ultimate saviors, the Divine Dragon Rangers, who allegedly thwarted an alien invasion 13 years ago. But the truth is far from heroic. The alien monsters were vanquished within a year, and since then, they've been coerced into a humiliating charade, producing a new monster each week for the Rangers to triumph over in staged battles. One alien, however, refuses to be part of this spectacle any longer. Determined to disrupt the status quo, he infiltrates the Dragon Rangers, intent on orchestrating their downfall from within. Will he succeed in exposing the truth, or will he become another pawn in this elaborate game? Only time will tell in this gripping tale of rebellion and deception.",
