  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Thirteen years ago, Earth was invaded by an army of alien monsters seeking world domination. However, a group of powerful protectors called the Divine Dragon Rangers quickly defeated them. Since then, the remaining monsters have been forced to participate in weekly staged battles against the Rangers for entertainment purposes, acting out scripted defeats again and again. Tired of this endless humiliation, a monster named Fighter D hatches a plan to infiltrate the Rangers and create an undefeatable monster to show humanity the true threat they still face. With the help of the mysterious Ranger Yumeko Suzukiri, Fighter D manages to obtain a powerful divine artifact, the only weapon capable of permanently destroying the immortal monsters. However, his infiltration attempt ultimately fails and he meets his end at the hands of the Rangers. With Fighter D gone, the question remains - who will step up to challenge the Divine Dragon Rangers' supremacy and unveil the truth behind these supposed \"heroes\" who keep humanity living in fear? The fight for freedom and domination continues to unfold in the shadows.",
