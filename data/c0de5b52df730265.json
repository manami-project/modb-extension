    "text": "After a century-long war between humans and beasts, a tradition emerged: a human sacrifice is offered annually to the King of Beasts to maintain peace. Enter Sariphi, the 99th sacrifice, who, instead of cowering in fear, captivates the King with her fearless and cheerful demeanor. Intrigued by her unique spirit, the King decides to spare her life and keep her by his side as his consort. As Sariphi navigates the magical and beastly kingdom of Ozmargo, she begins to form an unexpected bond with the King. However, as the next sacrifice approaches, the pair find themselves entangled in a web of secrets and events that could alter the fate of their worlds forever. Witness Sariphi's journey as she transforms from a mere sacrifice to a pivotal figure in the realm of beasts and demons.",
