    "text": "Each day brings a new lesson for Chitose, a high school student who, after leaving the orphanage, finds himself not in the solitary bachelor life he envisioned, but in a bustling household filled with five unconventional mothers. These women, all teachers at his school, are determined to nurture him into a responsible adult and create a loving family environment. However, Chitose, with his independent spirit and deep-seated mistrust of people, believes that his new mothers might need to mature themselves first.\n\nThe chaos in Chitose's new life is not without its challenges, as he must conceal the truth about his unique living situation from everyone, including the class president and the principal. Despite their quirks and mysterious pasts, each of his mothers brings something special to the table, from artistic creativity and nurturing support to athletic enthusiasm and spiritual wisdom.\n\nAs Chitose navigates this whirlwind of maternal affection and constant attention, he begins to understand the true meaning of happiness and the value of being part of a family. Alongside his two sisters, Hazuki and Minazuki, Chitose embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth, learning that sometimes, the most unexpected circumstances can lead to the most profound lessons in life.",
