  "synopsis": {
    "text": "All his life, William Twining, a young nobleman of exceptional intellect, has been steeped in the comforts of his aristocratic lineage and the rationality of modern science. However, his world is turned upside down when his family's fortune vanishes, leaving him in a dire financial predicament. In a frantic hunt for anything of value, William stumbles upon a hidden chamber in his manor's basement, inadvertently summoning Dantalion, a self-important demon and Grand Duke of Hell. As it turns out, Lucifer, the ruler of Hell, is in a state of deep slumber, and only the 'Elector', a human of Solomon's bloodline, can appoint an interim ruler, causing unrest among the demons. Despite his skepticism towards the supernatural, William is thrust into the heart of a celestial power struggle, as he is revealed to be the Elector. Now, all he desires is a peaceful life devoted to his studies, but with Dantalion and other demons vying for his favor, and Heaven itself after his soul, will he ever find the tranquility he seeks?",
