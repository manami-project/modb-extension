  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Special Agent 044, a product of genetic engineering and viral enhancement, is no ordinary human. As a government operative, she possesses extraordinary physical abilities, but the virus that granted her these powers also condemns her to a short lifespan. At 19, she's already outlived expectations, and now, she's on a mission to capture the elusive \"King\" and his ruthless Phage squad.\n\nAs she pursues her target, 044 encounters Luka, a Phage soldier she inexplicably cannot bring herself to kill. This hesitation brands her a traitor in the eyes of Daxus Jr., her government superior. Now, with both the Phage and her former allies on her tail, 044 must navigate a dangerous world of genetic modification and political intrigue alongside the injured Luka.\n\nIn a future where genetic manipulation is the norm, and the government holds all the power, 044 must confront her past, her mortality, and the truth about the Phage. Inspired by the 2006 film \"Ultraviolet,\" this anime offers a thrilling exploration of loyalty, identity, and the price of power.",
