  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Arrietty is a 14-year-old girl who belongs to a tiny race of people called the Borger. Along with her parents Pod and Homily, she lives secretly in the recesses under the floorboards of an old house in the countryside. The Borger survive by stealthily \"borrowing\" small items from the human inhabitants of the house. One summer, 12-year-old Shou comes to stay at the house while recovering from illness before an upcoming heart operation. He discovers Arrietty in the garden and they strike up an unlikely friendship, despite the danger discovery poses to the Borger way of life. As their secret friendship grows, tensions rise between the tiny Borger and their human hosts. Shou comes to appreciate the daily struggles and adventures the Borger face just to survive. And despite her parents' concerns, Arrietty sees that not all humans wish them harm. But even with kindness on both sides, the very different worlds these two friends inhabit put them increasingly at odds. Their special bond could bring about events that transform their lives forever.",
