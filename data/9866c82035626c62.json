    "text": "He is a colossal force, a rough-around-the-edges man with a strength that surpasses ordinary individuals - Matsutarō Sakaguchi. Unlike the typical protagonists of shōnen manga, he is not one to utter phrases like 'work hard,' 'strive,' or 'dream.' Instead, he stands unrivaled in the world of sumo wrestling, with an innate power that outshines all others. Yet, his carefree demeanor serves as his greatest vulnerability. Despite this, he evolves into a formidable sumo wrestler, proving that strength comes in many forms.",
