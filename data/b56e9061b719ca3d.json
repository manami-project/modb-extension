    "text": "Average elementary student, Bondo Taira, lives in a future where every household has an adorable, helpful maid robot called OrderMaids. Envious of his friends' graceful and skilled robots, Bondo convinces his mother to buy one for their family. However, the robot they receive is far from what Bondo had in mind. Instead of a dainty, efficient maid, Bondo is met with Roboco, an abnormally muscular, clumsy, and eccentric robot. Despite her destructive tendencies while performing simple chores, Bondo and his friends soon discover that Roboco is far more unique and capable than they initially thought, leading to an exciting and unpredictable adventure.",
