  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Choi, a cunning con man disguised as a pastor, and Sung, a well-meaning but manipulated religious leader, deceive their unsuspecting village into giving up their compensation for a dam construction project that will flood their homes. The only person aware of their deceit is Min-chul, a violent drunkard with a troubled past. As the village falls under the spell of the two supposed men of God, Min-chul's desperate attempts to reveal the truth are dismissed. But when his daughter is put in danger, Min-chul becomes determined to expose the con and bring justice to the villagers. This animated thriller explores the blurred lines between good and evil, as a good-hearted person speaks falsely and an evil-natured person speaks the truth. Winner of the Platinum Grand Prize at the 2014 Future Film Festival, this anime will keep you on the edge of your seat as you question who to trust.",
