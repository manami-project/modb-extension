  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As a high school student, K≈çta Shibaki's reputation as the school's number one pervert has left him with little luck in the romance department. One day, he stumbles upon a book about witchcraft and, as a joke, summons the young witch Rurumo. After helping her with a task, Rurumo refuses to take his soul, but as punishment, she is demoted to an apprentice witch and must complete the task of getting Shibaki to use 666 magic tickets that grant wishes before she can become a full witch again. However, each time Shibaki uses a ticket, his lifespan is shortened. Now, Shibaki must decide whether to use the tickets to help Rurumo become a witch again, or resist the temptation to save his own life. With Rurumo's familiar, Chiro, by his side, Shibaki must weigh the importance of his own life against the freedom of the lovely witch. This magical slapstick comedy follows the misadventures of Shibaki and Rurumo as they navigate the challenges of the human world and the consequences of using the magical tickets.",
