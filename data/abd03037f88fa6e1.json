  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Two young British hunters, out with their dogs in the forest, lose their way and become separated from their canine companions. Wandering through the woods, they eventually come across a mysterious restaurant standing alone amidst the trees. Though puzzled by its unexpected presence, the famished men enter, hoping to find a meal. Inside the odd establishment, the proprietors and patrons regard the pair with unsettling intensity. As the uncomfortable hunters attempt to order, it gradually becomes apparent that the roles have reversed - and they are now the ones being hunted. Will the men escape this strange place and its predatory staff, or have they just become the next items on the menu? This suspenseful scenario comes from a short story by acclaimed Japanese author Kenji Miyazawa. Though originally only a few pages long, later adaptations have built upon the tense concept, inserting additional scenes while retaining the tale's central theme of man unexpectedly transformed from hunter into prey.",
