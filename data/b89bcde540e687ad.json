  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Earth's future is under threat when a meteorite crashes, unleashing the M34 virus, a deadly contagion that transforms humans into savage, alien-like creatures. As the virus rapidly spreads and decimates the human population, specialized government agencies, including the elite NOA team, are established to combat the outbreak. NOA's soldiers are enhanced with nanomachines that enable them to morph and battle the infected, but the virus's relentless mutations soon render their efforts futile.\n\nIn this dire situation, hope emerges in the form of a seemingly ordinary 16-year-old girl, Ai. Gifted with a unique power and an \"amplifier\" to vanquish the monstrous creatures, she is humanity's last line of defense. As she forges a connection with Yuji, a member of the NOA team, her true abilities awaken, especially when love blossoms between them.\n\nWith time running out and the virus evolving at an alarming rate, can Ai and Yuji together turn the tide and save humanity from the brink of extinction? The fate of the world hangs in the balance, as the battle against the M34 virus reaches its critical juncture.",
