  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a dystopian future, a meteor crashes to Earth, unleashing a deadly virus known as M34 that transforms infected humans into monstrous creatures. To combat this threat, the government forms special military units equipped with advanced nanotechnology and cybernetic enhancements. One such elite unit, NOA, seems capable of holding back the spread of infection initially. However, the virus mutates into a stronger strain that overwhelms NOA's defenses. With humanity on the brink of annihilation, an unexpected savior emerges - a 16-year old girl named Ai. She possesses mysterious abilities that could mean the difference between mankind's salvation or destruction. As the outbreak rages out of control, Ai begins training to unlock her full powers. In the midst of this chaos, Ai forms a meaningful bond with a NOA soldier named Yuji. Their deepening relationship kindles an emotion within Ai that proves pivotal in fueling the strength she needs to confront the virus. With the infected continuing to evolve at a terrifying pace, Ai races against time to master her enigmatic gifts before the virus and those transformed by its corrupting touch extinguish humanity's last hope.",
