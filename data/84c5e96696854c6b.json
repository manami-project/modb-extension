  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Soul Eater Not! follows Tsugumi Harudori, a freshman halberd weapon at the Death Weapon Meister Academy (DWMA). On her first day, she befriends two meisters - the airheaded Meme Tatane and tsundere Anya Hepburn. The three girls are part of the NOT class, which focuses on helping weapons and meisters control their abilities to live normal lives, unlike the advanced EAT class taken by upperclassmen like Maka and Soul. As Tsugumi gets to know her new friends and tries to find confidence in her own abilities, she encounters the everyday adventures and hijinks that come with attending a school full of young weapons and meisters. With the support of Meme, Anya, and new friends made along the way, Tsugumi works to overcome her indecisiveness and self-doubt while learning to harness her inner strength. Though she still has much to learn, Tsugumi approaches each new challenge with an open heart and determination to do her best. As she comes into her own, she inches closer to finding a meister partner perfectly suited to fight alongside her.",
