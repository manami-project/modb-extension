  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Katsumata Agetarou, the third-generation owner of a humble tonkatsu restaurant in the bustling Shibuya district, finds himself in a rut, unenthused by the daily grind of frying breaded pork cutlets. A chance delivery to a nearby nightclub sparks a newfound passion in Agetarou as he's drawn into the vibrant world of clubbing, captivated by the pulsating music, lively patrons, and charming girls.\n\nAs he frequents the club, an encounter with the legendary American DJ, Big Master Fly, ignites a revelation: the rhythmic synchronicity of spinning tracks is akin to the rhythm of preparing tonkatsu. Agetarou becomes determined to master both crafts, with his sights set on becoming a DJ while upholding his family's tonkatsu legacy.\n\nWith the support of his neighborhood friends and guidance from his mentor, DJ Oily, Agetarou embarks on a hilarious and heartwarming journey to balance his dreams with his responsibilities, navigating the challenges of family, love, and the urban life of Shibuya.",
