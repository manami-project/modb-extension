    "text": "Space princess Fandora and her shapeshifting sidekick Que travel across dimensions as bounty hunters. They possess a powerful red jewel called the Jewel of Lupia, which aids them in battling criminals too dangerous for conventional weapons. While pursuing the space outlaw Red Eye Geran, Fandora and Que arrive in the kingdom of Lemia. Here they discover an evil religious leader has seized control, possessing his own blue jewel. This blue jewel could potentially combine with Fandora's Jewel of Lupia to unify the dimensions - for better or worse. Now faced with this ominous foe, the bounty hunting duo is fated to confront the mystery behind the two powerful jewels that threatens the balance of the universes. Their spacefaring adventures will lead them across exotic alien worlds as they fight to take down criminals and unravel the secrets behind dimensional travel.",
