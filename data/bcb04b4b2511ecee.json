    "text": "Nikola is a young girl living a quiet life in the remote village of Bayle, located on the peaceful island of Clayborne. Though her days gathering firewood may seem mundane, she finds contentment in the familiar rhythms of her community. However, Nikola's world is thrown into upheaval when a dragon—a creature rumored to lurk only in the distant mountains—attacks her village. She is saved by a mysterious traveler named Haga, who reveals himself as a member of the King's Seekers, an elite investigative group. Intrigued by Haga's adventures and the hidden secrets of their world, Nikola decides to venture beyond the safety of her village. As she explores with Haga, she discovers that sinister forces threaten the peace in even the most isolated corners of Clayborne. Though Nikola longs for the simplicity of her old life, she must work with Haga to uncover the darkness plaguing their land. In the process, the unlikely partners may find that they have more in common than meets the eye. This rich fantasy world holds both beauty and unexpected threats. As an ordinary girl forced on an extraordinary journey, Nikola must draw on inner resilience she never knew she possessed if she hopes to save all she holds dear.",
