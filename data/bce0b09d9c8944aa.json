  "synopsis": {
    "text": "She's a dreamer and a fighter, Tsukushi Makino, a young woman who trades sweat and toil for a chance to dance in the vibrant heart of New York City. By day, she's a cleaner in a prestigious dance studio, but by night, she's a dancer in the making, perfecting her moves in secret. Her only allies in this challenging world are Kazuya, a loyal friend from the lighting department, and Makiko, a wardrobe assistant.\n\nWhen the studio's star dancer, Sakurako Sanjo, falls victim to jealous rivals, Tsukushi finds herself in the spotlight. Despite her humble beginnings, she's not afraid to stand up to Tsukasa Domyoji, the male lead, proving that she's more than just a cleaner. As fate would have it, Tsukasa gives her a chance to audition for the lead role. Will Tsukushi's determination and passion be enough to make her dream a reality?\n\nSet in an alternate timeline to the TV series and manga, this story unfolds like a modern-day Cinderella tale, with 80's dance as its backdrop. Tsukushi, with the support of Rui Hanazawa and Tsukasa Doumyouji, strives to rise above her circumstances and claim her place in the spotlight. In this alternate Hana Yori Dango universe, the cast is immersed in a world of dance and music, offering a fresh take on their familiar roles. Will Tsukushi find the courage and confidence to seize her destiny and become the star she's always dreamed of being?",
