  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story follows Kezuru, an average junior high school student who has a fateful dream one night. In this vivid dream, Kezuru sees himself as a wizard battling alongside a magical creature called a \"mazin.\" He also glimpses a mysterious girl urging him on. The next day, Kezuru's friend Kuracchi shows him a new trading card game called \"Mazica Party.\" To Kezuru's astonishment, the cards feature the very same characters from his dream. Soon after, Kezuru receives an invitation to a special event at the Mazica company. There, he meets the CEO Jeff Johns, who gifts Kezuru a Mazica Gear kit and tells him he has high hopes for Kezuru's future. On his way home, Kezuru gets attacked by a bizarre, airship-like monster. Just in time, his new Mazica Gear activates, allowing him to make a pact with the mazin Barunya, a curious fusion of cat and airship. With Barunya's help, Kezuru defeats the monster. The mysterious girl Anya then appears and informs Kezuru that he and others like him are destined to become true wizards who will save the world. Kezuru subsequently enrolls in the Mazica Academy, where he engages in card battles alongside his mazin partner Barunya and trains to fulfill his wizardly fate.",
