  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Aya, a young girl, finds herself in an extraordinary situation outside a Louis Vuitton store while waiting for her friends. A peculiar creature, the LV Panda, seizes her cell phone and swallows it whole. In her attempt to retrieve her phone, Aya is also consumed by the panda. However, instead of finding herself in the creature's stomach, she is transported to a surreal and psychedelic realm filled with ever-changing shapes and vibrant colors. All Aya desires is to reclaim her phone, but this fantastical world, born from the collaboration between renowned superflat artist Takashi Murakami and Louis Vuitton, has other plans for her. This anime film offers a unique blend of art, animation, and a touch of commercial flair.",
