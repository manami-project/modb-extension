    "text": "After being separated for 10 years, high school student Shin Kanzato and his younger brother Jun move to the futuristic Ayanagi City to live with their older brother Ryo, the chief of the Ayanagi City Police. However, a series of strange incidents begin occurring in the city, including the sudden disappearance of a submarine's crew, the reemergence of \"Apathy Syndrome\" that leaves people devoid of spirit, and gruesome murders with victims' insides turned outside their bodies. As Ryo investigates these incidents, Shin unwillingly becomes involved as well, awakening a mysterious power known as \"Persona.\" With others awakening similar powers, Shin discovers he is being drawn into a hidden world and truths about both the city and his own family that he never imagined. As the incidents intensify, the bonds between the brothers will be tested as dark secrets come to light.",
