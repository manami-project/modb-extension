    "text": "Upon her birth, Qian Yunxi, the firstborn daughter of a powerful minister, was gifted with extraordinary supernatural abilities. However, her family deemed her powers as an ill omen and exiled her to the secluded Spirit-Cloud Mountain. At the tender age of 16, Qian Yunxi is thrust into an unexpected arranged marriage with the enigmatic Prince Ye Youming, taking her younger sister's place. The prince is infamous for his cold demeanor, eccentricities, and alleged cruelty, leaving Qian Yunxi uncertain of her fate.\n\nAs the wedding unfolds, the royal family remains oblivious to the intricate web of deception woven by Qian Yunxi's family. The prince, harboring a deep-seated grudge against the Qian family, initially treats Qian Yunxi with disdain, even banishing her from his palace. Nevertheless, her vibrant charm and audacious spirit gradually begin to chip away at his icy exterior.\n\nThe stage is set for a thrilling tale of love, deception, and political intrigue, as Qian Yunxi navigates her new life within the royal court and the unforeseen challenges that lie ahead.",
