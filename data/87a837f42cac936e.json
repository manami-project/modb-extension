  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ungrar's escape from his prison cell on Vaccine World unleashes a destructive virus known as \"Angler\" towards Earth. In response, Maya, the Goddess of Vaccine World, sends Mugimaru, a small hamster-like creature, to Earth to find a human to wield the powers of Vaccine World and become a Magical Nurse. Mugimaru encounters Komugi Nakahara, a playful, lazy, and easily distracted teenager with dreams of becoming a cosplay idol. After Komugi tends to Mugimaru's wounds, he entrusts her with the magic wand, and she becomes the Magical Nurse.\n\nNow, Komugi must balance her career with the Kiri-Pro Promotion Company and her new role as a Magical Nurse, fighting against Ungrar's loyal henchman, the Magical Maid Koyori. With her magical syringe for flight and her Moe Moe Magical Shower healing attack, Komugi is ready to face any obstacle, from viruses to mecha-anime cliches, and even death itself. Join Komugi-chan in this parody anime series as she navigates the tumultuous world of cosplay and magical girl nursing to save the Earth.",
