  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Keiichi Morisato is an unlucky college student who can't seem to catch a break, whether with clubs, love, or just getting through daily life. One day while stuck on dorm duty, Keiichi accidentally reaches the Goddess Help Line when trying to order a pizza. To his shock, a goddess named Belldandy appears from his mirror to grant him a wish. In disbelief, Keiichi jokingly wishes for Belldandy to stay by his side forever. His wish is unexpectedly approved and a contract binding Belldandy to him is magically sealed. Though initially awkward with each other, Keiichi and Belldandy grow closer while trying to figure out how to make their unprecedented living arrangement work. Moving into an old temple together, their relationship slowly turns from strangers to friends to possibly something more. However, their deepening bond draws the attention of others who aren't so keen on a human and goddess being together. As external forces try to separate them, Keiichi and Belldandy continue learning about themselves and what they truly want out of life in this unexpected romance.",
