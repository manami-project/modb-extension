  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime is a spin-off from the popular Inazuma Eleven soccer franchise, offering viewers an alternate universe that creatively twists the original plot's fundamental concepts. The series introduces the Fubuki brothers in its inaugural episode, followed by the Ohisama En in the subsequent one. These character-centric narratives are presented as anime shorts, originally aired during the Inazuma Walker livestream program, serving as a prelude to the events of Inazuma Eleven: Ares no Tenbin. This fresh take on the beloved franchise promises an engaging and unique viewing experience for both newcomers and dedicated fans alike.",
