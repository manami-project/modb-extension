    "text": "Will a promise of flowers from a long-lost friend bring joy or unleash darkness upon Earth? Mamoru, who once gifted a rose to a young alien boy named Fiore, is approached by none other than Fiore himself, who has returned to fulfill his promise. But Fiore's intentions may not be as innocent as they seem. As Mamoru's cherished memory resurfaces, a sinister force lurks in the shadows, waiting to exploit Fiore's loneliness and jealousy.\n\nThe Kisenian flower, a malevolent plant exiled to a distant galaxy, has the power to consume the energy of living beings and transform their weaknesses into dark power. When Fiore stumbles upon this dangerous bloom, he becomes the perfect host, and his newfound strength threatens the very existence of Earth and the people he once held dear.\n\nAs Mamoru's relationship with Usagi deepens, Fiore's envy grows, fueled by the Kisenian's accumulated hatred. It's up to Sailor Moon and the Sailor Senshi to uncover the truth behind Fiore's return and protect the planet from the darkness that looms. Can they save Mamoru and the world from the wrath of a scorned friend turned enemy? The fate of Earth hangs in the balance in this thrilling and heart-wrenching adventure.",
