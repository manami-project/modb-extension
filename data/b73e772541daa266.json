  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuru Camp tells the story of three high school girls who share a love of camping. Chiaki and Aoi start an Outdoor Activities Club, hoping to plan ambitious trips even though it's just the two of them at first. When the cheerful Nadeshiko joins, the cozy clubroom starts attracting curious visitors but not many new members. Undeterred, the trio set off on a camping adventure in Australia, bringing their friends Rin and Ena along. During what was supposed to be a relaxing trip, an unexpected incident turns their journey into an exciting excursion none of them will ever forget. Leading up to this main story, three special OVA episodes provide backstory about the club's origins and growth. \"Heya Camp Episode 0\" shows life before Nadeshiko joins, while the other specials give more insight into the friendships between all the girls.",
