    "text": "An elite faction of humanity has evolved with extraordinary abilities, leading to the establishment of the Deviant Control Office, an autonomous organization tasked with maintaining order and balance. While some strive to preserve harmony, others seek to exploit their powers for personal gain, disregarding the consequences.\n\nNewly appointed to the Deviant Control Office's cleanup crew, Xuan Ji finds himself entangled with Sheng Lingyuan, a once-great ruler resurrected through forbidden sorcery after a thousand-year slumber. As they navigate their complex past, they must confront an imminent catastrophe: a sinister ritual requiring the sacrifice of a thousand souls to summon a demon.\n\nThe lines between good and evil blur as Xuan Ji, Sheng Lingyuan, and the cleanup team race against time to thwart the impending disaster. Their mission is shrouded in secrecy, as a grand conspiracy brews, threatening to disrupt the delicate balance of their world. Will they succeed in preserving order, or will chaos reign supreme? Only time will tell.",
