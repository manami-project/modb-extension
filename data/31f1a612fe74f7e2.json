    "text": "Sunday mornings are supposed to be calm, but not for Kazuto. A mysterious woman, Ymir, startles Rika when she emerges from the bathroom mirror. Ymir, an old classmate of Valkyrie, has arrived on Earth for a school reunion, which is to be held at the Tokino bathhouse. The reunion brings a host of peculiar alumni from the Academic Planet, each arriving in the most unexpected ways. Amidst this chaos, Akina is chosen to be the priestess for the Farewell Star Banquet, a rare ceremony held once every nine centuries to honor the passing of the Slepni comet. The ceremony requires everyone, including the Valkyrie princesses, to journey to a satellite near Pluto.\n\nKazuto's life has taken a dramatic turn as he now shares his home with two Valkyrie princesses - a teenager and a child. Both princesses are unmarried and eager to change their status, adding to the chaos in Kazuto's life. The magical events that led to this unusual living arrangement continue to unfold, making Kazuto's life anything but ordinary.",
