  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ayaka Kisaragi runs the Phantom Quest Corp, a ghost-hunting business that tackles cases involving spirits, vampires, and other supernatural phenomena threatening Tokyo. Though skilled at vanquishing paranormal dangers, the team struggles financially due to Ayaka's free-spirited lifestyle and irresponsible handling of company funds. Ayaka comes from a long line of exorcists but forged her own path by founding PQC rather than undergo formal training. She prefers singing karaoke and going out on the town to studying the occult arts. Fortunately, Ayaka can rely on her loyal assistant Mamoru to get her back on track when she sleeps in and on police inspector Kouzou Karino to supply a steady stream of supernatural cases. Backed by a quirky team, Ayaka confronts the dark forces haunting Tokyo with style and flair, if not always punctuality. Though ghostbusting doesn't pay the bills, she's determined to keep PQC solvent while having fun her own way. Whether vampires, ghosts, or demons, Ayaka makes sure the city's spooks get a goodnight kiss!",
