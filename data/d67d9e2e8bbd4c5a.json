  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Amakusa Shino, Shichijou Aria, Hagimura Suzu, and Tsuda Takatoshi are back for another year of outrageous antics in Ousai Private Academy's student council. As the only male member, Takatoshi finds himself once again surrounded by a trio of eccentric girls. Shino, the perverted president, Aria, the pantyless secretary, and Suzu, the diminutive treasurer, continue to challenge Takatoshi's patience and sanity with their wild behavior.\n\nAs the new school year begins, the group welcomes fresh faces, including Takatoshi's equally perverted younger sister, Kotomi, and Uomi, the aloof student council president from Eiryou High School. With these new additions, the chaos and sexual humor reach new heights, leaving Takatoshi to navigate the madness as best he can.\n\nHaving recently transitioned from an all-girls school to a co-ed institution, Ousai Academy presents unique challenges for its students. As one of the first male students, Takatoshi must adapt to his new environment while maintaining a sense of decorum amidst the student council's lewd discussions. The Ousai student council may be tasked with upholding morality, but their own perverted tendencies often take center stage, making for a hilarious and unpredictable journey through high school life.",
