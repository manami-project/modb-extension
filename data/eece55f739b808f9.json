  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Material Network, or 'Metal', a secure, virtual realm revolutionizes human society in 2061, offering a sanctuary where people can explore their deepest desires and instincts without restraint. This new network emerged after the original information network society, plagued with security issues, failed to deliver the anticipated utopia. In this new reality, personal memories are safeguarded within virtual enclaves called Bubble Shells Online.\n\nAs people become increasingly reliant on the Metal, an unexpected friction arises between the limitless freedom it offers and the stringent norms that govern the real world. This discord manifests in strange aberrations that defy imagination, and a specialized group of professionals known as 'cyber divers' are tasked with investigating these anomalies.\n\nHaru Masamichi, once a victim of a catastrophic experiment that left him comatose for 50 years, awakens to find himself an old man in this transformed society. Determined to uncover the truth behind the mysterious 'Metal' and the reason for his lost years, Haru embarks on a journey to become a cyber diver. Joined by the lively Minamo and an android named Holon, Haru delves into the enigmatic depths of the Metal, seeking answers and striving to save those lost within its allure.",
