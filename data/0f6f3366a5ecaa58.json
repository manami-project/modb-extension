    "text": "There's a future where cosmic disputes are resolved through interstellar contests, and the TERRA Team – consisting of Yohko, Momiji, Ayano, and Madoka – are at the heart of the action. In \"Starship Girl Yamamoto Yohko (2),\" the team attempts to make the most of their summer break, but unforeseen disruptions threaten their relaxation. The team's adventures continue as they delve into the remnants of a forgotten civilization and face a new rival determined to defeat Earth's top pilot.\n\nAn old legend on a far-off planet speaks of four goddesses descending from the heavens to bring harmony to the world. Meanwhile, the TERRA team finds themselves stranded on a remote planet, struggling to escape before their new companion's hunger becomes a problem. During a grand cosmic Sakura festival, a member of the team is invited to join high command, meeting with NESS counterparts. However, not everyone seems to share the spirit of celebration and peace.\n\nThe team returns for more space adventures, only to encounter a new adversary: Sylvie Dread, a former TERRA pilot with a personal vendetta against Yohko. As the girls find themselves entangled in an ancient prophecy, a special galactic event stirs up envy among teammates when Yohko receives special attention.",
