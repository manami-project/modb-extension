Despite his initial reluctance, Ryouhei finds himself drawn to Rena's hidden charms as they spend more time together. As their affair deepens, Ryouhei struggles to balance his growing feelings for Rena and his professional relationship with his superior, who remains oblivious to their liaison.\n\nTheir clandestine encounters become more frequent, and Ryouhei finds himself captivated by Rena's unrestrained persona outside the office.
