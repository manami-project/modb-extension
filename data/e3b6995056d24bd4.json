  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Koneko serves coffee at Cafe Nowhere, but her mundane life takes a turn for the extraordinary when she becomes entangled with the Hamatora Detective Agency, run by Nice and Murasaki. In this world, a select few possess unique supernatural abilities known as 'Minimum.' These gifted individuals, called 'Minimum Holders,' are trained at the prestigious Facultas Academy and enjoy privileged lives. However, not everyone shares these benefits, like Art, a police inspector who lacks such powers. When a string of murders targeting Minimum Holders rocks the city, Art enlists the help of his old friend Nice, a powerful Minimum Holder who left the academy to establish his own detective agency. Together with Murasaki, the cool-headed member, and Hajime, the ever-hungry but timid one, they delve into the case that threatens to disrupt the very fabric of their society. As the investigation unfolds, the Hamatora team discovers a sinister plot that goes beyond a simple serial killer, forcing them to confront the darker side of their world.",
