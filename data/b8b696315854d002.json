  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a small coastal town in Japan, three middle school students - Komori Tarou, Oogami Makoto, and Nakajima Masayuki - seem to lead ordinary lives on the surface. However, they share a mysterious connection and traumatic past that begins to resurface through Tarou's disturbing dreams. Years ago, Tarou was kidnapped and his sister went missing, but he has repressed the memories of what truly happened. Now, the supernatural manifestations of his dreams and visions start blending with reality, suggesting a breach between the spiritual and corporeal worlds. As Tarou, Makoto, and new student Masayuki investigate the site of Tarou's kidnapping - a deserted hospital beyond the dam - they discover the ability for their souls to cross between worlds. In this hidden realm that connects dreams and reality, the three boys confront their personal demons and the dark secrets of their past. Their journey of self-discovery peels back the layers of mystery shrouding the town of Suiten. By repairing the metaphysical divide, they aim to finally find closure regarding the unsettling events that still haunt them after all these years.",
