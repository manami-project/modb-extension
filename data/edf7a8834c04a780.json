  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Seventeen-year-old Kazuki Shikimori attends Aoi Academy, an elite institution for magicians. Despite hailing from a lineage of powerful magic-wielders, Kazuki's magical abilities are below average, and he is limited to casting only eight spells in his lifetime before turning to dust. Consequently, he is looked down upon by his peers and seen as a failure. However, his genetic potential makes him a valuable target for three young women: Yuna Miyama, who declares herself his wife upon arrival; Rin Kamishiro, a skilled swordswoman who seeks to eliminate him to pursue her own desires; and Kuriko Kazetsubaki, a member of an influential family who tries to seduce him for his genes. As Kazuki navigates the unwanted attention and jealousy from his classmates, he must also deal with the ever-decreasing number of spells he can cast, which dwindles as he finds himself unable to resist using magic to help the girls. Will Kazuki's fate as a supposedly unremarkable magician change for the better, or will he succumb to the pressures of his magical world?",
