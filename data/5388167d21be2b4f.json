    "text": "Ana, Chika, Matsuri, Miu, and Nobue return for more delightful, everyday escapades in Ichigo Mashimaro! Nobue, the 20-year-old friend, is on a quest for part-time employment to fund her vices, but her younger sister Chika and their friends have other plans. From dictionary explorations to classroom naps, hide-and-seek adventures, and impromptu cosplay as cats and rabbits, there's never a dull moment with this lively crew. Join them as they embark on trips to the library, school, and even a short holiday, making every day a little sweeter and a lot more entertaining. Based on Barasui's manga series, this OVA continues the adorable antics of these friends, proving that the simple things in life can be the most charming.",
