  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rags Town is home to people seeking to leave their pasts behind. However, strict rules forbid its residents from inquiring about one another's histories. Here lies S&A Detectives, a small agency run by the quirky duo of Ayamana. When Manami impulsively takes on a case involving a mysterious woman with amnesia dubbed \"Sara\", trouble arises. Sara possesses abnormal heat and is pursued by gun-toting women. Meanwhile, teenage girls across Rags Town are inexplicably turning into glass. As the government covers up the strange occurrences, the detectives, a reporter, and the police seek the truth behind Sara and the vanishing glass women. Through this thrilling investigation, S&A Detectives may find more than they bargained for - not only about the secrets of the town, but also about themselves.",
