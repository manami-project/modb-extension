  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Her alding the quirky escapades of a feline duo, Azuki and Daizu, this anime offers a delightful glimpse into their daily shenanigans within a bustling household. The cats' owner, a dedicated office worker in her 30s with a soft spot for felines, resides with her extended family, including her father, mother, and grandfather. Adding to the mix is the enigmatic presence of her older brother, affectionately referred to as 'Megane' (Glasses) by the cats.\n\nMegane's unique contribution to the household is Mamenosuke, a Shiba Inu dog he adopted following the passing of its original owner. Having been raised in the company of cats, Mamenosuke has an identity crisis of sorts, believing himself to be a cat. This delightful blend of characters promises a heartwarming and entertaining exploration of their shared existence, filled with laughter, camaraderie, and a touch of chaos.",
