    "text": "Company Island, a prestigious academy where students engage in strategic games to earn stars and climb the social ladder, welcomes its newest transfer student, Hiroto Shinohara. On his first day, Hiroto inadvertently challenges and defeats Sarasa Saionji, the reigning champion and granddaughter of the island's head director. This unexpected victory propels Hiroto to the esteemed rank of Seven Star, the highest position in the school.\n\nHowever, Hiroto's triumph is merely a fluke, and he lacks the true strength and skill required to maintain his newfound status. To avoid expulsion and achieve his mysterious personal goal, Hiroto must rely on his wit, deception, and the support of the enigmatic Company led by Shirayuki Himeji. As he navigates the treacherous world of lies and bluffs, Hiroto must outsmart his fellow students and maintain his Seven Star facade until graduation. Will he succeed in his quest, or will his web of deceit unravel, revealing his true colors? Only time will tell in this thrilling game of strategy and survival.",
