    "text": "Imperial army dog, Norakuro, finds himself in the midst of a fierce war against the Monkey Army as part of the 'Mokenrentai' brigade. Being a stray black-and-white dog among white dogs, Norakuro stumbles through his duties as a Private Second-Class. Adapted from the comics, this series remains mostly true to its source material, with the notable addition of Miko, an army nurse who captures Norakuro's heart. Voiced by Nobuyo Ooyama, who later gained fame for voicing Doraemon, Norakuro's adventures are filled with humor, camaraderie, and canine heroics. This engaging series offers a unique blend of military life and light-hearted antics, promising a captivating watch for anime enthusiasts.",
