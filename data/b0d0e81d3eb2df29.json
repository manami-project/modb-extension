  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Silicon lifeforms have plunged the world into chaos, leaving a post-apocalyptic future where the human world has been decimated. In this landscape, a sprawling mega-structure spans thousands of levels, making it impossible to distinguish the sky from the ground. Based on Tsutomu Nihei's manga Blame!, this anime follows the enigmatic Killy as he navigates the eerie and unsettling levels of this vast edifice, where the lines between machines and living organisms have become blurred. As the robots known as 'Constructers' continue to build without purpose, a new form of life emerges, and Killy embarks on a quest to comprehend this chaotic world that seems intent on eradicating all living beings.",
