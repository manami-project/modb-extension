    "text": "Sergeant Packy Perkins and Private Bota Botasky, a dynamic duo in the elite private military unit Cat Shit One, are no ordinary soldiers - they're rabbits. Stationed in the Middle East, these furry warriors are tasked with a high-stakes mission to rescue hostages held by insurgents. As the situation escalates, the pair must rely on their specialized combat training and tactical prowess to navigate the perils of war and save innocent lives. Based on a popular Vietnam-era manga, this compelling anime delivers a unique twist on the war genre, offering a factual portrayal of modern warfare through an anthropomorphic lens. With no official word on future installments, this finished airing series promises a thrilling and engaging experience.",
