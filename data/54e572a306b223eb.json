This rustic region, known for its lush greenery, flowing waterfalls, and hot spring resorts, served as the inspiration behind their popular anime series. Follow the pair as they traverse along mountain paths, pause to appreciate the tranquil Kaname Falls, and soak in the restorative waters of Tsurukame hot spring. With Nyanko-sensei by his side, Natsume finds peace and solace in the calming landscapes of the countryside. Their relaxing trip allows them to temporarily escape the supernatural disturbances that typically surround Natsume in his daily life. Immerse yourself in the untamed beauty of Hitoyoshi Kuma along with these two beloved characters. Their lighthearted travels highlight the rich nature and serenity that originally captivated the creator of this long-running franchise.",
