    "text": "Kurogane Taito is an unmotivated high school freshman who feels that hard work is not rewarded. However, Taito has forgotten a pivotal event from his childhood. Nine years ago, he met Saitohimea, a female vampire, and made a promise to her. Lately, Taito has been having strange dreams about Saitohimea, who claims to have given him her \"poison.\" He even thinks he can hear her voice when awake. After surviving a near-fatal accident, Taito realizes these are more than just dreams - they are memories. He remembers making a pact with Saitohimea and now launches a mission to rescue the vampire girl, who has been held captive for the past nine years waiting for Taito to free her. This ordinary boy is about to have his world turned upside down as forgotten promises and supernatural encounters upend his mundane life.",
