  "synopsis": {
    "text": "His dreams of a successful life are nothing but a distant echo for Bong Gi, who now finds himself overweight, jobless, and repulsive to the world around him. His nights are spent in solitude, engrossed in online gaming and secretly admiring pictures of women he could only dream of being with. But one morning, Bong Gi wakes up to find himself transformed into the very kind of woman he used to admire online. Stunned and confused, he turns to the internet for help and encounters Sae Mi, a charming young woman who offers him advice. As he begins to fall for Sae Mi, things take a complicated turn. To make matters worse, Sang Woo, the school bully who once hurt Bong Gi, turns out to be Sae Mi's older brother. \"Bagel Girl\" is a 2019 South Korean animated series that follows Bong Gi's bizarre journey as he navigates his new life as a woman and confronts his past demons.",
