  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Three years before enrolling at First High School, Miyuki and Tatsuya Shiba did not have the close sibling relationship they do in the present day. Miyuki felt uncomfortable around Tatsuya, whom her family treated as a servant assigned to protect Miyuki despite his impeccable conduct. This tense dynamic shifted permanently during a fateful trip to Okinawa in 2092. When an unknown enemy force suddenly invaded, Miyuki and her mother were caught in the dangerous battle, leaving them helpless and relying solely on Tatsuya's protection and strength to ensure their survival. It was through this harrowing experience that Tatsuya and Miyuki's bond as siblings was permanently transformed.",
