    "text": "Clutching onto a dream of freedom, Cestvs, a 15-year-old slave, is thrust into the brutal world of gladiator combat in 54 AD Rome. Trained as a pugilist, he is forced to fight for his life in a ruthless arena where victory is the only path to survival. His first match against his best friend ends in tragedy, leaving Cestvs grappling with the weight of his actions. Each win means the death of his opponent, and he is haunted by the realization that he is fighting for his life while taking the lives of others. With the shadow of Nero, the fifth Roman Emperor, looming over him, Cestvs must navigate a treacherous path filled with powerful adversaries. His only hope for a future lies in securing 100 victories, a promise made by his owner. As he fights for his freedom, Cestvs must confront the brutal reality of his existence and decide what price he is willing to pay for his liberty.",
