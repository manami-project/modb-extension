    "text": "The anime centers around Kanenone Gakuen, an all-boys academy that is preparing to become coeducational. With the merger only months away, a group of incoming female students pay a visit to get acquainted with the school. During this visit, two teenagers named Yusuke Takasaki and Futaba Kutsuki are finally able to meet and realize their mutual feelings for one another. However, finding an opportunity to confess proves challenging. That's when a mysterious girl named Midori Chitose begins appearing in Yusuke and Futaba's dreams. Calling herself a matchmaker from the future, Midori offers erotic encouragement to the young couple, urging them to seize the moment before they are separated again when the girls leave. Bolstered by Midori's support, Yusuke and Futaba are ultimately able to connect and bring their relationship to a conclusion before the end of the trial period. Though they face an impending long-distance situation, the two make the most of their limited time together.",
