  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Despairâ€™s deadly grip tightens once more as Makoto Naegi, the beacon of hope who once triumphed over the Ultimate Despair, Junko Enoshima, finds himself accused of treason. As a member of the Future Foundation, an organization dedicated to rescuing the world from the Remnants of Despair, Naegi is suspected of harboring these very remnants. During a gathering to decide his fate, the Foundation's top members, including Naegi's former classmates Kyoko Kirigiri, Aoi Asahina, and Yasuhiro Hagakure, are ensnared by a familiar foe - Monokuma.\n\nTrapped in a new killing game, the group is forced to uncover a traitor who threatens to murder them in their sleep. To heighten the terror, each member is bound by a forbidden action, the violation of which leads to instant death. As the body count rises, Naegi, the Super High School-Level Lucky Student, must push his hope-filled ideals to their limits and unravel the mystery before despair claims them all.\n\nIn this brutal game of survival, there are no class trials, and the only way to end the madness is to identify and eliminate the killer. With no one to trust and deadly consequences looming, Naegi must navigate this treacherous path where hope and despair collide. The desperate tale unfolds as hope is pitted against hope in a battle to the death.",
