    "text": "Conan's swift intervention averts a catastrophe when a subway tunnel explosion targets the Tokyo governor. His investigation leads him to a tranquil mountain village, Kitanosawa, which harbors hidden secrets and a mysterious connection to the governor's past. Conan discovers that the village was once relocated for a dam construction project initiated by the governor. As he delves deeper into the case, he encounters a group of friends with ties to the old village, a boy in a coma, and a suspicious hit-and-run accident from eight years ago. With the stakes high and the mystery deepening, Conan must unravel the truth behind these interconnected events to prevent another attack on the governor's life.",
