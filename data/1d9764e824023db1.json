    "text": "Six teen years into the Taisho era, in 1: In 1925, when women's rights in Japan were still a distant dream and baseball was considered a male-only sport, two spirited 14-year-old girls, Akiko and Koume, challenge societal norms by forming an all-girls baseball team. Amidst the backdrop of a rapidly changing Japan, where even running was deemed unladylike, the duo faces numerous hurdles in recruiting members, securing parental consent, and mastering the complexities of the sport. Driven by a desire to prove a chauvinistic baseball player wrong, the girls embark on a journey of self-discovery, camaraderie, and perseverance, breaking barriers and defying expectations in a society on the brink of transformation.",
