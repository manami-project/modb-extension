    "text": "The Norse god of mischief and deception, Loki, finds himself exiled to the human realm, stripped of his divine form and reduced to the appearance of a child. In order to return to the world of gods, Loki must gather auras of evil that have corrupted human hearts. To achieve this, he establishes a detective agency, where he uses his cunning and supernatural abilities to solve mysteries and collect the auras.\n\nJoining Loki in his quest is Mayura, a young human girl with an insatiable curiosity for mysteries. Together, they embark on a series of enigmatic adventures, encountering various gods from Norse mythology who disguise their true forms. Some of these gods offer assistance to Loki, while others harbor sinister intentions, aiming to take his life.\n\nAs the gods divide into factions and tensions escalate, the prophesied end of the world, Ragnarok, looms ominously on the horizon. Unbeknownst to Mayura, she becomes entangled in Loki's struggle to return home, finding herself at the heart of the impending apocalypse. Will Loki manage to regain his place among the gods, or will he fall victim to the machinations of his divine adversaries? Only time will tell in this thrilling, mythological mystery adventure.",
