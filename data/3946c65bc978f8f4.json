    "text": "Asuka Yuuki, a star soccer player, remains oblivious to the fact that his childhood friend, Meirin Kanzaki, harbors deep feelings for him. Meirin, a junior high school student, hails from a lineage of feng shui masters and possesses an uncanny ability to detect and banish spirits. However, she must conceal her extraordinary powers from her father, who remains unaware that his greatest rival, Dr. Rin, is none other than his own daughter. As Meirin navigates the challenges of adolescence, she secretly uses her psychic abilities to guide her peers in matters of love. But when menacing emails begin to target Asuka, Meirin must rely on her feng shui expertise to protect him, even as he dismisses her beliefs as mere superstition. Will Meirin's love for Asuka triumph over his skepticism, or will her powers remain a secret forever?",
