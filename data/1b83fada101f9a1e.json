    "text": "While Rudeus reunites with his father in the capital city of Millishion, Eris sets off on a personal quest to fulfill her dream of defeating goblins. At the Adventures' Guild, she crosses paths with an arrogant young mage named Cliff, who insists on joining her goblin hunt despite her protests. Eager to prove herself, Eris accepts Cliff's dare to venture into the dangerous forest on the outskirts of Millishion in search of goblins. However, what awaits them in the shadowy woods is far worse than mere goblins. Together, Eris and Cliff find themselves facing a vile threat that will test their mettle as adventurers. Through perseverance and teamwork, the unlikely duo must overcome their differences to survive the harrowing ordeal. In the process, Eris inches closer to checking goblin slaying off her bucket list.",
