  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While Rudeus Greyrat is occupied with a reunion with his father in the bustling city of Millishion, Eris Boreas Greyrat, the skilled swordswoman of the Dead End adventurer party, finds herself with a day of freedom. With a burning desire to hunt down goblins, Eris sets out on an exciting escapade. However, her plans take an unexpected turn when she bumps into Cliff Grimoire, a self-important young mage at the Adventurers' Guild. Despite her initial reluctance to team up with Cliff, his persistent audacity leads them both into the dangerous forest surrounding the city. As they delve deeper into the woods, they stumble upon a menace far more grotesque than the goblins they initially sought. This thrilling side story unfolds in a bonus episode of \"Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation Part 2,\" chronologically taking place during the events of episode 5 from the second part of the first season.",
