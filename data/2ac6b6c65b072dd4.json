    "text": "It's been 189 years since a devastating supernova wreaked havoc on Earth, leaving only a fraction of the population alive. Now, in 2356, humanity is bracing for the second wave of destruction from the same supernova. To safeguard the planet, colossal space stations known as 'Foundations' have been established throughout the Solar System. One such Foundation, Stellvia, is home to a high school for aspiring space cadets, including the bright-eyed and determined 15-year-old Shima Katase. Defying her mother's wishes, Shima enrolls at Stellvia with dreams of exploring the cosmos and protecting her home planet. As she navigates the challenges of piloting a spacecraft and forging new friendships, Shima embarks on a journey of self-discovery and growth, all while preparing for the most crucial mission of her life: shielding Earth from the impending second wave.",
