    "text": "Kyouko, Mirai, and Asuka are three ordinary girls with extraordinary potential, unbeknownst to them. When the beautiful and enigmatic Sayo, an agent of a clandestine organization, approaches them with the opportunity to train as idols, they eagerly accept. However, Sayo's true intentions lie far beyond the glitz and glamour of the idol world. Earth is on the brink of destruction, threatened by an imminent meteorite impact. The only hope for salvation lies in the hands of these three unsuspecting girls.\n\nAs they embark on their idol journey, they find themselves working part-time at an arcade under Sayo's watchful eye. The arcade, however, is not just a mere facade for their idol training. It is here that they must hone their skills on a seemingly innocuous crane game, which holds the key to harnessing their latent powers. As they master the art of the crane game, they begin to question Sayo's true motives. Little do they know, the fate of the Earth rests on their ability to create a powerful energy beam capable of diverting the impending meteorite.\n\nWill they be able to balance their dreams of becoming idols with the responsibility of saving the world? Only time will tell in this thrilling and heartwarming tale of friendship, courage, and the power of dreams.",
