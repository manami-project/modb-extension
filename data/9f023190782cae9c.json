    "text": "Yuuta and Rikka have recently started dating, but both are too shy to progress their young relationship. As Christmas approaches, their friend Shinka advises Rikka to use the holiday to get closer to Yuuta. Following a suggestion from their other friend Makoto, the group decides to hold a Christmas party at Sanae's place. At the villa, while planning some party activities, Rikka disappears. Yuuta goes searching and finds her acting strangely, quickly realizing she and Sanae somehow got drunk! With Rikka intoxicated, Yuuta faces an unexpected challenge in moving their relationship forward. Ultimately, the Christmas party takes an unpredictable turn for the new couple. Through this lighthearted holiday gathering, Yuuta and Rikka continue navigating the ups and downs of young romance. Their friends try to push them closer together, but they still have much to learn about building intimacy. Even so, the Christmas spirit brings warmth and joy despite the hilarious misadventures.",
