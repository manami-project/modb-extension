    "text": "Jin Kazama enjoyed a peaceful childhood, learning the family's revered Kazama-Style Traditional Martial Arts from his mother Jun. However, their quiet lives are shattered when a vicious demon named Ogre attacks, killing Jun. Overcome by grief and anger over his inability to save his mother, Jin sets out to find his grandfather Heihachi Mishima. Though initially dismissed by Heihachi, Jin convinces him to take him under his tutelage after revealing that Ogre was behind Jun's murder. What follows is an arduous training regimen as Jin turns his sorrow into strength under Heihachi's stern guidance, driven by a burning desire to gain the power necessary to avenge his mother by defeating Ogre. The culmination of Jin's quest leads him to the King of Iron Fist Tournament, a global fighting competition said to draw the strongest combatants. Believing Ogre will eventually show himself there, Jin enters, ready to face his mother's killer and fulfill his vow of vengeance. On this grand battle stage, the ultimate showdown awaits.",
