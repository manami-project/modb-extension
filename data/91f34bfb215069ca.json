    "text": "In the heart of modern Kyoto, art student Kumi finds herself in an unexpected adventure when she moves in to take over her late grandmother's candy store. Instead of finding an empty house, she encounters three peculiar women - Harami, Mai, and K - and a dog, all cohabiting in the store. These women, as it turns out, are heroes reincarnated from another world, now enjoying the tranquility of contemporary life. However, their peace is disrupted by the arrival of Ran, a former demon king who, due to a reincarnation mishap, now appears as an elementary school girl. With Ran's request to gather the scattered fragments of the demon king, a new chapter unfolds in this extraordinary tale of heroes, a demon king, and an unsuspecting college student.",
