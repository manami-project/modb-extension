  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The once thriving Genesect species finds itself on the brink of extinction, with only a handful of members left, led by a unique Shiny Genesect. Desperate to find a new home, they set their sights on New Tork City, drawn by its towering skyline that resembles their lost mountainous habitat. However, their arrival spells trouble for the city's residents and Pokémon alike, as the Genesect's nest poses a threat to the city's power supply, and they exhibit hostility towards anyone who dares to approach. To make matters worse, the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo, whose creation was influenced by human intervention, forms an alliance with the Genesect, empathizing with their plight. However, the Shiny Genesect leader harbors mistrust towards Mewtwo, leading to a fierce conflict that could potentially devastate the entire city. It's now up to Ash, Pikachu, and their friends to intervene, quell the escalating tension, and prevent the impending catastrophe.",
