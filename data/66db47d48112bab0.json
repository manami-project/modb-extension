  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Those selected for the clandestine 'D Agency' in 1937, on the brink of World War II, are not your typical military personnel. Led by the innovative Lieutenant Colonel Yuuki of the Imperial Japanese Army, this unique team is composed of civilian university graduates who have excelled in a rigorous selection process. Defying traditional military doctrine, Yuuki instills in his agents a code of conduct that prioritizes stealth over violence: 'Don't kill, don't get killed, don't get captured.' Under his guidance, they master an array of skills, from handling explosives and operating communication devices to pickpocketing and cracking safes. As they navigate treacherous political landscapes both at home and abroad, these agents must rely on their wits and training to gather vital intelligence, manipulate allies and enemies, and stay one step ahead in a world teetering on the edge of war.",
