Choosing the latter, Mahoro is transformed into a civilian android, complete with a new role as a maid for Suguru, a high school student living alone after the loss of his parents. Despite her new peaceful existence, Mahoro's past is never far behind, and she must navigate the challenges of everyday life while hiding her true nature and the secret connection she shares with Suguru.
