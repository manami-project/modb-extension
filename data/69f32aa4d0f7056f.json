    "text": "Pendleton Orphanage's eldest resident, Judy Abbott, finds herself thrust into an extraordinary opportunity when an anonymous benefactor offers to sponsor her education at the prestigious Lincoln Memorial Girls' School. With only a glimpse of his elongated shadow, Judy affectionately nicknames him \"Daddy Long Legs.\" In return for this life-changing gift, she must write him monthly letters, although the prospect of a reply remains uncertain.\n\nAs she embarks on her journey at the new school, Judy encounters a world vastly different from the orphanage she's always known. Alongside new friendships with the affluent Julia Pendleton and the kind-hearted Sally McBride, Judy learns valuable life lessons and experiences adventures she never thought possible.\n\nBased on Jean Webster's novel, \"Daddy Long Legs\" chronicles Judy's growth and self-discovery as she navigates this new chapter of her life. As she pens her heartfelt letters to her mysterious benefactor, she can't help but wonder about the man behind the shadow. Who is this enigmatic figure that has so generously changed her life? Only time will tell.",
