  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Dino, an Italian manager of a peculiar café, scouts Maika Sakuranomiya, a high school student with a dream to study abroad. Maika's intimidating smile, which previously hindered her job search, lands her a unique role at Café Stile. The café's waitresses embody distinct personas, such as tsundere and imouto, to cater to customers' preferences. Maika is assigned the role of a super sadist, leveraging her unintentionally menacing smile. Despite her initially struggling to adapt to her dominant and cruel character, Maika's dedication to her work allows her sadistic persona to flourish unexpectedly. This outrageous working comedy serves up laughter and entertainment, making even being stomped on seem like a treat.",
