  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hero es and plant manipulators collide in the futuristic world of 22XX, where a dwindling human population has led to the integration of diverse alien races. In this new era, genetic blending has given rise to extraordinary abilities, but rapid industrialization threatens the natural world. Amidst this backdrop, Yuuki, a young man of mixed heritage, grapples with his unique powers inherited from both his heroic father and his mother, a member of a supposedly extinct plant-controlling tribe. As Yuuki navigates his allegiances, he must decide which side to support, ultimately shaping the destiny of this intergalactic society. Originally part of Anime Tamago 2020, this anime brings a captivating tale of self-discovery, environmental responsibility, and the complexities of a multi-species world.",
