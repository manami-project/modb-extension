    "text": "Tenchi Masaki is a seemingly ordinary teenager living on Earth, but his life is anything but normal. He finds himself surrounded by a group of extraterrestrial women, each with their own unique backgrounds and personalities, who end up living with him. This eclectic group includes: Ryouko, a space pirate; Washuu, a scientific genius; Ayeka and Sasami, princesses from the planet Jurai; Mihoshi, a ditzy detective; and Ryo-Ohki, a creature that can transform into a spaceship. Though Tenchi's life becomes more chaotic with all these women vying for his attention, he also begins forming meaningful bonds with each one as he learns about their personal struggles and histories. Tenchi eventually discovers that he is part of the Juraian royal family. Additional details are revealed about Sasami, Washuu, and Ryo-Ohki's backgrounds. More members of the Jurai family are also introduced. No matter what galactic adventures or difficulties come Tenchi's way, he handles it with patience and good humor. Though the women constantly create chaos in his household, the affection they all share continues to grow.",
