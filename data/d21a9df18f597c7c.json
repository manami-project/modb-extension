  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Will ing to spend his days immersed in his otaku lifestyle, 17-year-old Hajime Nagumo's mundane life takes a drastic turn when he and his entire class are summoned to a fantastical realm. Tasked with the heroic duty of saving humanity, each student is granted extraordinary powersâ€”all except Hajime. Labeled as weak and insignificant by his classmates, Hajime finds himself bestowed with a seemingly lackluster transmutation skill, branding him a mere Synergist.\n\nTormented and ostracized, Hajime's new life as a hero becomes a living nightmare when he is pushed into the treacherous depths of a monster-infested dungeon. With only his crafting abilities and relentless determination, he must navigate the perilous labyrinth, facing off against formidable creatures and overcoming insurmountable odds.\n\nDuring his desperate struggle for survival, Hajime encounters an imprisoned vampire named Yue, who shares his desire to escape. Together, they forge an unbreakable bond and embark on a daring adventure to return home. As they delve deeper into the unknown, Hajime's once-ordinary existence evolves into a tale of unparalleled strength and courage, forever changing the fate of the world he now calls his own.",
