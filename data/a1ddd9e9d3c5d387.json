  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Unrealistic yet captivating, the anime Kikumana follows the journey of a young girl as she navigates a world where the ordinary becomes extraordinary. Trapped in a room filled with books and devoid of human interaction, Kikumana's reality takes a surreal turn as inanimate objects come to life. From snowflakes falling from a light bulb to a mysterious white hand appearing from a doorway, Kikumana finds herself in a world that blurs the line between reality and imagination. As she tries to find herself amidst the strange occurrences, Kikumana's story unfolds like a stage performance, leaving the audience with a sense of eeriness and wonder. With a pictorial atmosphere and documentary-like touch, this anime aims to create a unique and otherworldly experience for its viewers. Will Kikumana find herself in this strange new world, or will she remain lost in the realm of the unknown? Only time will tell.",
