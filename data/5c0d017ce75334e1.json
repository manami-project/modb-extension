  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yumi Fukuzawa is a shy first-year student at the prestigious Lillian Girls' Academy, an all-girls Catholic school in Tokyo. She admires the beautiful and popular second-year student Sachiko Ogasawara, who is part of the revered student council known as the \"Roses.\" Though they barely know each other, Sachiko unexpectedly asks Yumi to become her \"soeur\" or \"sister\"â€”a Lillian tradition where older students mentor and guide underclassmen. As Sachiko's soeur, Yumi is suddenly thrust into the spotlight. The entire school buzzes with rumors about the unlikely pair. Yumi grapples with understanding her new role and sorting out her complicated feelings for Sachiko. Together, they navigate the traditions, relationships, and drama among the Roses and soeurs at Lillian. Through it all, a quiet romance seems to bloom between the two soeurs.",
