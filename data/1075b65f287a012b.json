  "synopsis": {
    "text": "12-year-old Oriko tragically loses her parents in a car accident and moves in with her grandmother Mineko at the family hot spring inn, Haru no Ya. At first reluctant, Oriko gradually begins admiring her grandmother's dedication to running the inn and starts training to become a young innkeeper herself. With encouragement from her supernatural friends like the ghost Uribou, Oriko works hard to hone her skills, find laughter through her tears, and carry on her family's legacy. This heartwarming coming-of-age story follows Oriko's growth from grieving girl to promising innkeeper-in-training.",
