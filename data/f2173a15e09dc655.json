    "text": "Bokutachi wa Benkyou ga Dekinai follows the story of Yuiga Nariyuki, a diligent high school student who strives for a prestigious scholarship to support his financially struggling family. In order to secure the scholarship, Nariyuki must tutor three brilliant yet eccentric girls who excel in one subject but struggle in others. Furuhashi Fumino, a literary prodigy, is hopeless in math, while Ogata Rizu, a math and science genius, is terrible at literature and arts. Meanwhile, Takemoto Uruka, Nariyuki's athletic childhood friend, struggles in all subjects except for sports. As university application deadlines approach, Nariyuki must find a way to help his students improve in their weakest subjects while navigating the comedic and romantic antics that ensue. Can Nariyuki successfully teach these seemingly unteachable girls and secure his scholarship? Only time will tell in this engaging and lighthearted anime.",
