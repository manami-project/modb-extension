    "text": "Sakurano Kurimu, the youthful president of Hekiyou Private Academy's Student Council, welcomes Ken Sugisaki, a diligent and academically gifted student, into their exclusive club. As the only male member, Sugisaki finds himself surrounded by a vibrant and diverse group of girls: the kind-hearted yet sadistic secretary Akaba Chizuru, the hot-blooded and athletic vice-president Shiina Minatsu, and the enigmatic yet beautiful treasurer Shiina Mafuyu. With graduation day fast approaching, Sugisaki's days are filled with endless entertainment and conversations about the students' lives and interests, as he records the minutes of the council meetings. However, the impending end of their school days threatens to disrupt their blissful existence in this second season of 'The Student Council's Discretion'.",
