Set during the summer between the third and fourth seasons of \"Ojamajo Doremi,\" the girls find themselves running a bakery and grappling with the challenges of growing up.\n\nFrom entering a swimming competition to creating the perfect taiyaki, each episode centers on a different character's personal journey or \"secret.\" And with Hana transformed back into a baby, the girls have an extra dose of chaos to contend with.\n\nBut it's not all fun and games - the series also delves into the romantic lives of the five witches, adding a new layer of depth to their relationships. With its more mature themes and focus on character development, \"Ojamajo Doremi Na-i-sho\" offers a fresh take on the beloved anime series. So join Doremi, Hazuki, Aiko, Onpu, and Momoko as they embark on a summer of self-discovery, adventure, and of course, a little bit of magic.",
