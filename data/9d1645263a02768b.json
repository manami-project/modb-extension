    "text": "Musashi is a young boy living a mundane life in the countryside with his father, three years after his mother mysteriously left them. Though Musashi longs to return to the excitement of Tokyo and hopes his mother will come back, his perspective shifts when he witnesses an older man fishing with a fascinating decoy technique. This chance encounter sparks Musashi's interest in lure fishing. As he develops considerable angling talents under the tutelage of local masters, Musashi learns that his missing grandfather was a champion bass fisherman. Inspired by his family legacy and the wonders of fishing, Musashi embarks on thrilling worldwide adventures in pursuit of rare and wondrous fish. With his enthusiastic friends Mio and Suguru alongside him, Musashi gains profound appreciation for nature while holding out hope that his impressive angling exploits could somehow reunite his fractured family. Though once bored in the countryside, Musashi now revels in the joys of outdoor living and newfound passions.",
