  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The narrative unfolds in Kisshou City, a tranquil haven nestled amidst barren landscapes ravaged by a century-old global conflict. This urban sanctuary, reminiscent of contemporary Japanese suburbs, is one of the few surviving oases worldwide, slowly succumbing to the aftermath of past wars. Relics of colossal robots, known as Legacies, are scattered throughout the city, remnants of a war-torn era, now repurposed and customized by the city's inhabitants.\n\nAs the city faces an imminent threat from a ruthless band of marauders, intent on plundering its resources and secrets, the mayor, Simone, takes a stand. Assembling a team of five rogue warriors, she prepares to defend the city using the last resort - Ω99 (Omega Double Nine), a formidable military robot that has been dormant for ages.\n\nEach of these robots, operated by pilots who can 'synchronize' with them, selects its own pilot, earning them the title of Synchronizers. Among these, Ω99, the most demanding to operate, chooses an unsuspecting teenager, Yamato. Unaware of the impending danger, Yamato, a seemingly ordinary boy with a knack for gaming, is about to embark on a mission to save his city.\n\nOriginally planned as a 52-episode series, the project was canceled, leaving behind a mere 52-second trailer, encapsulating the essence of this thrilling tale of a city's struggle for survival against insurmountable odds.",
