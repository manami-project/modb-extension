    "text": "Chris, a girl hailing from the future, finds herself in the midst of World War II, in 1943 Europe, following an unexpected time warp that brings a mysterious ship along with her. As the Nazis scheme to locate the ship and execute a secret plan known as Urda, two skilled agents, Janet and Erna, are deployed to thwart their efforts. The agents' mission is twofold: to prevent the Nazis from capturing Chris and locating the ship, and to disrupt the implementation of the sinister Urda project. The fate of the world rests on their success.",
