This ship and its technology in the wrong hands could enable the Nazis to reshape the past and future to their advantage. Now in a race against time, Janet and Erna must track down the ship, rescue Chris, and prevent the Nazis from fully unlocking the secrets of the vessel to realize their ambitions of world domination through the covert Urda initiative.",
