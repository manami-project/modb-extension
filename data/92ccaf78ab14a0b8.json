  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Shin Toutotsu ni Egypt transports us to the vibrant realm of ancient Egyptian deities, where the gods of yore, from the revered Anubis to the wise Thoth, reside in a world of their own. But this is no ordinary divine existence. Here, Bastet serenades with impromptu song and dance performances, while Medjed maintains an unwavering stoicism. Horus juggles a part-time job, Set finds joy in mischievous pranks, and Ra is a globetrotter who rarely returns home.\n\nBy day, these gods are dedicated to their divine duties, but when the sun sets, they indulge in a myriad of activities that add a touch of chaos to their otherwise orderly lives. Anubis, the god of death, even uses a child's seesaw to pass judgment!\n\n\"Oh, Suddenly Egyptian God\" offers a delightful peek into the unconventional lives of these gods, where duty and fun coexist in a whimsical blend of the divine and the mundane. Join us in this unique journey and discover that, perhaps, the secret to life is finding joy in the most unexpected places.",
