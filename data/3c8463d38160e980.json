    "text": "Battle Spirits: Sword Eyes takes place 14 years after civil riots tore apart the mighty kingdom of Atlantia. The protagonist, Tsurugi Tatewaki, was smuggled to safety as a child during the chaos. He grows up oblivious to his royal origins in the rugged region of Pacifis, where he lives a carefree life. One fateful day, Tsurugi discovers the mystical Shining Sword, which transforms into a powerful Battle Spirits card. This discovery sparks Tsurugi's epic adventure, as he gets pursued by dark forces seeking to claim his card. With the help of Bringer, a protective droid, and other brave warriors wielding magical swords, Tsurugi journeys to Atlantia to learn the secrets of his past and join the fight against encroaching evil. Along the way, the lines between good and evil become blurred, forcing Tsurugi to question everything he thought he knew. As mysteries unfold and stakes heighten, he must summon the courage to stand up for what he believes is right. The fate of Legendia hangs in the balance in this thrilling tale of self-discovery, mystical cards, clashing swords, and a young hero finding the hero within.",
