    "text": "Guardian Hearts, also known as Hina, descends to Earth with a mission to safeguard peace and maintain her identity under wraps. However, when Kazuya inadvertently witnesses Hina's transformation, he is thrust into her secret world. Convinced that family can share secret identities, Hina moves in with Kazuya, marking the beginning of an unpredictable cohabitation.\n\nMeanwhile, Maya, Kurusu, and Chelsea form an unlikely alliance to seek revenge on Guardian Hearts for their past hardships. Under the assumption that Guardian Hearts appears when Kazuya is in the company of a girl, they leave Hina alone with him, hoping to draw Guardian Hearts out.\n\nAs if cohabiting with a guardian heart wasn't challenging enough, Kazuya finds himself surrounded by a growing number of girls, each revealing their magical abilities to him. Navigating the complexities of their attention and jealousy becomes a daily task for Kazuya, making his life anything but ordinary.\n\nDespite the girls viewing their cohabitation with Kazuya as coincidental, it seems there might be more to it than meets the eye. Can Kazuya survive in this magical whirlwind of girls and secrets? Only time will tell!",
