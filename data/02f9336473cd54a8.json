  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With the peaceful city of Kushiro, Hokkaido, plunged into chaos in the year 199X A.D., an unlikely hero emerges to save humanity from the brink of destruction. The once tranquil city becomes the battleground for colossal monsters known as Dragonites, who wield unparalleled destructive power. As these behemoths lay waste to the city, they inadvertently awaken an ancient evil sealed within the Rock of Sealing â€“ the malevolent Jashin Drago.\n\nDetermined to conquer Earth, Drago and his ruthless Empress Zara command an army of biomechanical demons, leaving even the formidable Japan Self-Defense Forces helpless against their onslaught. Amidst the ensuing chaos, Ken Taiga, a seemingly ordinary boy, discovers his extraordinary lineage. Descended from the legendary Lion Clan, Ken bears the sacred mark of the Liger, which once sealed Jashin Drago away centuries ago.\n\nUnbeknownst to the Dragon Empire, Ken's latent powers awaken in a moment of fury, revealing his Liger birthmark. As he raises his palm and invokes the command, 'LIGER!', Ken transforms into the mighty Jushin Liger, donning an imposing long-haired biomechanical armor. With the fate of humanity resting on his shoulders, Ken must harness his newfound abilities to vanquish the evil forces of the Dragon Empire and restore peace to the world.",
