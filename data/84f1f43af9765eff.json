  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Kōmei, a new transfer student at St. Francesca Academy. On her first day, she bumps into Kan'u and quickly becomes friends with her, much to Rin Rin's dismay. The school then announces a competition where teams will compete in various athletic events, with the winning team's leader becoming the new student council president. Kan'u asks Kōmei to join her team for the competition. As they and their teammates Chōun and others prepare for two-legged races and other ecchi-filled events, hijinks ensue leading to humorous wardrobe malfunctions. While each team aims to win school leadership, the athletic contests ultimately serve more to bring the girls closer together, forging new friendships and understandings. With athletic competition and abundant fanservice driving the plot, this comedic ecchi anime promises to entertain viewers looking for school-life humor and ample bouncing bosoms. The story follows the relationships between rivals and friends as they pursue victory but end up gaining much more.",
