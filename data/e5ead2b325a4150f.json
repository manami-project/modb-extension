    "text": "Son Goku and his friend Krillin journey to the remote island home of the legendary martial arts master, Kame-Sen'nin, seeking to become his students. However, the old master agrees to train them only if they complete a perilous quest - to retrieve the beautiful Sleeping Princess held captive in the foreboding Devil's Castle. Eager to begin their training, Goku and Krillin readily accept the challenge and set off on their mission. Meanwhile, their friends Bulma, Yamcha, Puar and Oolong come looking for Goku at Kame House and learn of the quest. Concerned, they decide to follow after Goku and Krillin. As the friends near Devil's Castle, they are set upon by demonic forces. Now Goku and Krillin must navigate the castle's supernatural dangers to rescue the princess from the vile Count Lucifer, who imprisons her. Little do any of them suspect what trials await inside the sinister fortress. But if Goku and Krillin succeed, the reward will be invaluable - becoming students of the legendary Turtle Hermit.",
