    "text": "Gokuâ€™s and Krillin's thirst for martial arts mastery leads them to the doorstep of the legendary, albeit eccentric, Master Roshi. However, the master has an unusual request before he agrees to mentor them: retrieve the stunning Sleeping Princess from the clutches of Count Lucifer in the distant, ominous Devil's Castle. The duo embarks on this perilous quest, unaware of the danger that lurks ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, their friends Bulma, Yamcha, Puar, and Oolong set out to visit Goku, only to discover his departure for the Devil's Castle. Intrigued, they follow suit, only to be ambushed by demons en route. Bulma awakens to find herself in the castle, under the seemingly benign care of Count Lucifer.\n\nAs the story unfolds, Goku and Krillin must navigate through a realm of demons and danger, not just to secure their master's tutelage, but also to rescue their friends and the enigmatic Sleeping Princess. The journey promises thrilling encounters and unexpected alliances, all in the pursuit of martial arts excellence.",
