    "text": "Angela, the daughter of the American team's sponsor, vanishes under mysterious circumstances as Lisa, Lorna, and Souichi, the victors of the Japanese preliminary round, arrive in Los Angeles for the eX-Driver World Race Competition. The trio's first night in the city is disrupted by an AI-controlled car gone rogue, which they manage to halt, only to have it confiscated by the disgruntled local police. As the international racing teams unite to tackle the criminal forces threatening the competition, Souichi embarks on a daring rescue mission to find Angela, who has been kidnapped along with him by Chinese thugs. The connection between the illegal gambling on the race and the series of incidents becomes apparent, and Souichi must now escape with Angela and expose the sinister plot behind the eX-Driver World Race Competition.",
