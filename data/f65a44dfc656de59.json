    "text": "When a mysterious dark power suddenly enshrouds the Earth after a total solar eclipse, the peace of Juban City is shattered. The Dead Moon Circus arrives with the goal of liberating their queen Nehellenia by stealing the Legendary Silver Crystal and plunging the world into eternal darkness. To achieve their dark aims, the Circus unleashes nightmarish 'Lemures' that haunt people's dreams, slowly siphoning their energy. As the Lemures spread, chaos engulfs Juban and its citizens begin to fall prey to the unrelenting nightmares. In these dire times, the Inner Sailor Guardians reunite to bring hope back to their beloved city. Led by the ever-determined Usagi Tsukino, the Guardians must overcome the loss of their transformation powers and the mysterious illness that has befallen Mamoru Chiba. When Usagi and Chibiusa encounter the mythical winged-horse Helios, they discover the Circus’s true motives and learn that unlocking Helios’ Golden Crystal may be the only way to dispel the darkness. With the Dead Moon Circus tightening its dark grip on the Earth, the scattered Sailor Guardians race against time to regain their lost powers and band together once more to shine the light of hope through Juban's nightmare. The ultimate battle that will determine Earth's fate is about to begin.",
