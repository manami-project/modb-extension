    "text": "Two worlds, Earth as we know it, and a parallel dimension known as the Black World, home to demons and dark magic, have coexisted in a delicate peace for centuries. To maintain this equilibrium, a peace treaty must be renewed, but a radical faction from the Black World is determined to disrupt the negotiations. Enter two elite agents from the Black Guards, an organization dedicated to preserving inter-dimensional harmony. One is a top human agent, the other a captivating assassin from the Black World. Together, they must protect the key negotiator from dark forces and ensure the treaty is signed, or risk plunging both worlds into chaos. The future of both dimensions hangs in the balance, and these two agents are the only hope for preserving the fragile peace.",
