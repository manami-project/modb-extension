  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The story centers around the four princes of the Glanzreich Kingdom - Kai, Bruno, Leonhard, and Licht - who are all vying to become the next king. They are guided by their intelligent and competent royal tutor, Heine Wittgenstein, who helps the princes overcome challenges and gradually mature, despite occasional confusion. One day, the twin princes of the neighboring Romano Kingdom - Ivan and Eugene - suddenly arrive in Glanzreich. Although the twins initially appear cute and harmless, their sadistic nature is soon revealed. In an effort to strengthen relations between the two kingdoms, Heine is tasked with also tutoring the Romano twins during their stay. Faced with the twins' extreme rudeness and resistance to his teaching methods, Heine and the Glanzreich princes decide to take matters into their own hands. What follows is a comedic battle of wits and \"educational guidance\" as Heine attempts to teach the Romano twins some important life lessons. Full of political intrigue, clashing personalities, and humorous antics, the story promises insight into the coming-of-age of princes who hope to one day rule their kingdoms.",
