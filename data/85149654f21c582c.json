  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Grannzreichs's four princes—Kai, Bruno, Leonhard, and Licht—are on a quest to become the next king under the tutelage of the talented yet childlike Heine Wittgenstein. As they navigate through various challenges and grow, an unexpected twist arrives in the form of twin princes from the neighboring Romano Kingdom. Despite their adorable appearance, the twins are notoriously sadistic and refuse to acknowledge those they deem unworthy of the throne. To foster a stronger relationship between the two kingdoms, Heine is tasked with tutoring the Romano princes alongside the Grannzreichs. However, the twins' disdain for Heine's teaching methods and their haughty behavior leads to an unprecedented crisis, forcing Heine and the four princes to take matters into their own hands and provide some much-needed 'educational guidance.' Will they be able to rise to the challenge and teach the twins a lesson they'll never forget?",
