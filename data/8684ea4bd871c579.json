  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Enjoji and Ranmaru are a happy couple whose relationship faces turmoil when Ranmaru discovers signs of potential infidelity. On the day in question, Enjoji comes home late reeking of makeup and perfume, with lipstick stains on his shirt. When a woman calls for him, Ranmaru storms off, hurt by the implications. As the two spend the day apart, they reflect on cherished memories from the beginnings of their relationship in junior high when they first fell in love. Now, with Enjoji's new host club job keeping him out late and acting shady, Ranmaru questions their future. A breaking point is reached when Ranmaru finds the lipstick stain. Though deeply pained, Ranmaru resolves that if this is what Enjoji truly wants, he will step aside. Despite the drama, their profound bond and feelings for each other endure, hinting at the likely reconciliation of this conflicted yet devoted couple. Their reminiscing reveals that what they share runs deeper than this one incident. Though their commitment faces its greatest test, true love may prevail if they choose to fight for one another.",
