  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ichinose's life takes a dramatic turn when he discovers his lineage is intertwined with the ancient bloodline of the Oni, a race of demons known for their ferocity. For centuries, the Oni have been at odds with the Momotarou, another powerful bloodline. The Oni, aware of their own savagery, once lived in isolation, but their tranquility was disrupted by a Momotarou-led invasion. Over time, these two factions established the Momotarou Agency and the Oni Agency, perpetuating their conflict. When Ichinose is attacked by a Momotarou, he is thrust into a world of dark heroics, forced to confront the Oni dwelling within him. As he grapples with his newfound identity, Ichinose must navigate the treacherous path laid out by his heritage, a journey filled with vengeance, self-discovery, and the struggle to control his own demonic powers.",
