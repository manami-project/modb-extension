    "text": "This intriguing anime follows the story of an enigmatic teenage boy who seems to exist outside of normal time. Through a series of interwoven narratives, we learn how this boy has profoundly impacted the lives of multiple people, though they each remember meeting him at different ages. One such person is Oriya Rouma, a lackadaisical high school student who belongs to the kickboxing club. His best friend Tamaki is often frustrated by Rouma's lazy attitude. Their everyday antics get shaken up when a new student with strange powers transfers to their school. His origins remain a mystery, but everyone seems to have distinct memories of him. As the various perspectives unravel, a fascinating portrait emerges of this teenage boy who drifts in and out of people's lives, leaving indelible impressions behind. The anime explores the connections he forges, the experiences he shares, and the memories he creates that transcend the normal bounds of time. Full of chaos, humor, drama and a touch of the fantastical, this story promises to take audiences on a poignant and magical ride. Will we finally uncover the secrets surrounding this enigmatic character? Or will he disappear as suddenly as he arrived, leaving behind more questions than answers?",
