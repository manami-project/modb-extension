    "text": "Tokyo's streets are no stranger to the peculiar and the paranormal, but they've met their match in the form of Yakushiji Ryouko, a prodigious 27-year-old investigator for the Tokyo Metropolitan Police. With a multilingual skillset and a prestigious degree from Tokyo University's esteemed Department of Law, Ryouko is more than equipped to tackle the city's most bizarre cases. But her job isn't just about confronting otherworldly beings; she must also navigate a professional rivalry with Muromachi Yukiko, another accomplished and attractive investigator.\n\nAdapted from a collection of light novels penned by Tanaka Yoshiki and brought to life by illustrator Kakinouchi Narumi, this gripping anime chronicles Ryouko's supernatural investigations alongside her subordinate, Junichir≈ç Izumida. While Ryouko's talent is undeniable, Izumida soon realizes that her prowess comes with a hefty dose of ego and some unusual personal quirks. As they delve deeper into Tokyo's darkest corners, Izumida must learn to manage not only the city's terrifying threats, but also Ryouko's challenging demeanor. Will they be able to set aside their differences and work together to solve these spine-chilling cases? Only time will tell.",
