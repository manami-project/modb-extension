  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The animated film \"Human Lost\" centers around a futuristic world where humanity faces grave threats. The themes explore the essence of being human. Premiering globally in October 2019, the movie features an ending theme song titled \"Human Lost,\" performed by renowned Japanese hip-hop trio m-flo and featuring reggaet√≥n superstar J Balvin. This cross-cultural musical collaboration signifies a first between a Japanese act and the Columbian singer. The song initially debuted in a music video screened at Anime Expo 2019 in Los Angeles, building anticipation for the film and this groundbreaking East meets West partnership. Having connected a year prior at Summer Sonic festival in Japan, m-flo member Verbal and Balvin shared an appreciation for each other's cultural backgrounds. This inspired them to join creative forces for this project fusing Japanese and Latin American influences. With \"Human Lost,\" J Balvin, one of the most streamed artists worldwide, now shares his infectious urban Latino sounds with Asian audiences. Likewise, m-flo reaches Balvin's global fanbase, highlighting their signature hip-hop style. This crossover represents a cultural exchange aiming to resonate universally with listeners. The musical message complements the movie's exploration of humankind's shared experiences.",
