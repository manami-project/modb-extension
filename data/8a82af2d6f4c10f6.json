    "text": "Asian music fans are in for a treat as m-flo teams up with global reggaeton sensation J. Balvin for the theme song of the highly anticipated anime film, 'HUMAN LOST.' The collaboration marks Balvin's first-ever partnership with a Japanese artist, and the result is the electrifying track, 'HUMAN LOST feat. J BALVIN.' The song, which served as the ending theme for the movie, was first unveiled in a music video that doubled as an announcement for the collaboration.\n\nThe collaboration was born out of a shared love for Japanese culture and music, with Balvin and m-flo's VERBAL connecting at Japan's largest music festival, Summer Sonic. Balvin, a multiple Latin Grammy winner and a top global streaming artist on platforms like YouTube, Spotify, and Deezer, jumped at the opportunity to work on the 'HUMAN LOST' theme song.\n\nThe music video for 'HUMAN LOST' is a visual spectacle that perfectly complements the film's futuristic and dystopian themes. Fans of both the anime and the artists can look forward to an immersive audiovisual experience that bridges the gap between Eastern and Western entertainment.",
