  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This anime follows the extraordinary life of Hibiki Amami, a high school girl with an unusual ability to see and interact with ghosts. Amidst the typical high school environment, Amami's sixth sense transforms her surroundings into a bustling hub of supernatural activity. She befriends these spectral beings as effortlessly as she does her human peers, treating both with equal kindness and respect.\n\nSurrounded by a vibrant cast of friends, each with their own quirks, Amami navigates through her daily life, which is anything but ordinary. Among her friends is Narumi Inoue, a girl who, despite her deep-seated fear of the supernatural, finds herself drawn into Amami's ghostly encounters. Inoue's fear often clashes with Amami's accepting nature, creating a dynamic that adds an extra layer of intrigue to their friendship.\n\nTogether, they embark on heartwarming adventures, helping the ghosts fulfill their unfinished business and move on to the afterlife. Through these experiences, Amami and her friends learn valuable lessons about friendship, empathy, and the importance of cherishing every moment. Despite the occasional chaos and confusion, Amami wouldn't trade her unique ability for anything, as it allows her to connect with a world that most people never get to see.",
