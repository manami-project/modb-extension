  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows three supernatural creatures named Bem, Bera, and Bero who arrive in a large seaside city. Though they appear mostly human, they can transform into monsters with special abilities. The city is plagued by evil forces and immoral behavior from both humans and supernatural beings. Seeking acceptance, Bem, Bera, and Bero decide to remain in the city and battle the malicious monsters that attack humans. Despite facing discrimination themselves, they strive to protect people and defeat wickedness. They slowly make some human friends while persisting in their fight against evil. Their ultimate hope is that by vanquishing evildoers and saving humans, they will eventually gain enough goodwill to become fully human themselves. Though despised by many, they tenaciously continue their crusade against the monsters threatening the city and its inhabitants.",
