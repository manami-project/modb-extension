  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Bero, Bem, and Bera, a trio of youkai with human-like forms, find themselves in a bustling coastal city teeming with both humans and malevolent creatures. Despite their humanoid appearance, the three are often shunned and mistreated by the city's human inhabitants. However, this doesn't deter them from their noble mission: to protect the human populace from the wicked deeds of other monsters and youkai.\n\nThe trio's hope lies in the belief that their valiant efforts will one day transform them into full-fledged humans. With Bem's gangster-like demeanor, Bera's witchcraft, and Bero's innocent child-like appearance, they stand as the city's guardians against the sinister forces threatening its peace. Despite the harsh treatment they receive from the humans they protect, they remain steadfast in their quest for redemption and acceptance.\n\nTheir journey is fraught with battles against evil creatures bent on world domination, but the trio's unique abilities and unwavering determination make them formidable opponents. As they continue their fight against darkness, they also strive to earn the trust and acceptance of the humans they so desperately wish to join.",
