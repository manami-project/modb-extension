  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After a young boy named Sosuke discovers and rescues a goldfish, Ponyo, the two quickly form an unbreakable bond. Unbeknownst to Sosuke, Ponyo is not an ordinary goldfish but the daughter of a powerful sorcerer who longs to become human. In her pursuit to be with Sosuke, Ponyo uses her father's magic to transform into a human girl, which inadvertently disrupts the balance of nature and unleashes a colossal storm. To restore harmony and fulfill Ponyo's dreams, the duo embarks on a magical adventure, guided by love and friendship. With the help of Ponyo's mother, a beautiful sea goddess, they must overcome the challenges that stand in their way. This heartwarming tale, brought to life by Academy Award-winning director Hayao Miyazaki, is a delightful reimagining of Hans Christian Andersen's classic fairy tale, The Little Mermaid.",
