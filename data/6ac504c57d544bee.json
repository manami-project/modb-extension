Shinjiro discovers he has special abilities and becomes the new Ultraman, defending Earth from a new wave of alien invasions. However, a sinister alien organization called Dark Star soon launches an attack, making half of humanity mysteriously vanish. Journalist Kotaro Higashi investigates the \"disappearance incident\" and learns of Dark Star's plans to seize control of Earth. As Dark Star's warship appears, the missing people including Shinjiro's friend Rena are teleported aboard. Kotaro nearly dies uncovering the truth. In a climactic battle, Shinjiro as Ultraman joins five other legendary Ultra Heroes - Seven, Ace, Zoffy, Jack and Taro. Together, they confront Dark Star's destructive Golden Fortress mecha and assemble as six mighty defenders to save their planet.",
