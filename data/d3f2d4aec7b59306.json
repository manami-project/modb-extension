    "text": "Odd jobs and unexpected encounters define the life of Maji, a dedicated member of the Nagisa criminal organization. His loyalty and truthfulness have earned him a solid reputation in the gang, but his heart yearns for something more. That something comes in the form of Kumiko, a local high school girl who captures his attention. As Maji navigates the complexities of his criminal world, including run-ins with the rival Kikuchi gang, he finds himself torn between his duties and his newfound love. Based on the initial volumes of Ayumi Tachihara's 1986 manga, this anime offers a thrilling exploration of gang chivalry and the challenges of balancing love and loyalty in a dangerous world.",
