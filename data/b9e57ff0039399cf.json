    "text": "On a rainy morning in Tokyo, 15-year-old Takao Akizuki decides to skip school to sketch shoe designs in a beautiful garden, pursuing his passion for shoemaking. There he meets Yukari Yukino, a mysterious 27-year-old woman who seems adrift in life. Though an unlikely pair, Takao and Yukino continue to meet and bond in the garden on rainy days over the course of the season. As their relationship develops, they open up to each other about their personal struggles. The garden becomes an escape from reality where they find comfort. However, with the end of rainy season approaching, Takao wonders if time is running out to act on his growing feelings for Yukino. Their deepening relationship is put to the test as the skies begin to clear. Will the end of the rains also spell the end for the two souls who found solace together under gray skies? Or will their connection withstand the return of clear weather?",
