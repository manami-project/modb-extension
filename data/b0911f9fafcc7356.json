  "synopsis": {
    "text": "And so begins the tale set in the distant future of AD 3567, where the once-thriving human civilization now lies in ruins, its remnants clinging to the remnants of a world overrun by enigmatic, self-sustaining machines known as Gardeners. Sent from the moon with the sole purpose of eradicating humanity, these mechanical beasts have forced the survivors to eke out a living as hunters, scavenging what they can from the fallen Gardeners.\n\nAmong these brave hunters is Tokito Aizawa, whose life takes an unexpected turn when he encounters a mysterious girl named Tea. In a twist of fate, Tea addresses him as 'Koichi', a name unfamiliar to him, and introduces him to an extraordinary machine called Silver. This fateful meeting not only stirs up questions about Tokito's past but also awakens a power within him that transcends the capabilities of the Gardeners.\n\nAs Tokito navigates this new reality, he inadvertently opens the door to a potentially brighter future for humanity. In a world where technology still offers a glimmer of hope amidst the desolation, Tokito's journey promises to be a beacon of light in the fight against the Gardener onslaught. Will Tokito and Tea, alongside Silver, be the key to reclaiming Earth and restoring the human race to its former glory? Only time will tell.",
