    "text": "Association(3WA), Kei and Yuri, known as the Lovely Angels or notoriously as the Dirty Pair, are the organization's go-to Trouble Consultants. Despite their knack for solving cases, their chaotic methods often result in unintended destruction, much to the dismay of Chief Gooley and those they assist. From infiltrating a prisoner-controlled waste star facility to retrieve a warden, to hunting down a rogue robot weapon on Halloween night amidst citywide chaos, the Dirty Pair's unconventional approaches always lead to thrilling and unpredictable outcomes. Even on a seemingly peaceful agricultural planet, the duo finds themselves investigating a newly ordained deity with a deadly secret. As the Dirty Pair, Kei and Yuri continue to leave their mark on the galaxy, one explosive case at a time.",
