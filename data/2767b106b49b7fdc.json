  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kei and Yuri are partners working as Trouble Consultants for the World Welfare Work Association (3WA). Known by their codename \"Lovely Angels\" and their notorious reputation as the \"Dirty Pair,\" they take on various dangerous missions across the galaxy, though their unorthodox methods often lead to excessive collateral damage. We follow their adventures taking on different assignments - rescuing a warden from a prison planet taken over by inmates, tracking down a tactical robot weapon on the loose, investigating a deity killing believers, and more. Though efficient, their explosive solutions frustrate their chief and leave destruction in their wake. But the Dirty Pair always gets the job done in their own chaotic way. Action and chaos ensue as Kei and Yuri blaze a trail across the galaxy, using their skills and partnership to complete their missions as Trouble Consultants while struggling to live up to their nickname as the \"Lovely Angels.\" Their penchant for unintended mayhem tries the patience of their superiors but proves reliably entertaining misadventures.",
