    "text": "Tokyo Ghoul: Jack follows the story of Taishi Fura and Kishou Arima, two high school students brought together by a tragic incident involving ghouls in Tokyo's 13th Ward. Fura, formerly a baseball player turned delinquent, witnesses his friend being brutally attacked and killed by a man-eating ghoul named Lantern. Seeking revenge, Fura decides to hunt down Lantern, crossing paths with his quiet classmate Arima in the process. Unbeknownst to Fura, Arima is an ace investigator for the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG), a government organization dedicated to dealing with the threat posed by ghouls. Despite his young age, Arima is highly skilled, known as the CCG's \"Reaper.\" Together, Fura and Arima begin tracking down Lantern. Through their pursuit, a bond forms between the hot-headed Fura and the methodical Arima. The story provides insight into a young Arima before he earned his feared reputation, offering a glimpse at his life during his high school days. As the two close in on Lantern, they discover the man-eating ghoul may be someone closer than they ever expected. Their hunt culminates in a final confrontation, where Arima and Fura both uncover surprising truths.",
