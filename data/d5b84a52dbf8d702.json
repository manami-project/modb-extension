  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Utage is a dedicated high school fangirl who works part-time to support her obsession with Tamon, the wildly popular leader of boy band F/ACE. When a job sends her to Tamon's home, she's shocked to discover the real Tamon is nothing like his confident onstage persona. Instead, he's insecure and struggling with the pressures of fame. Threatening to quit F/ACE, Tamon is clearly in crisis. As his number one fan, Utage takes it upon herself to save Tamonâ€”from himself. Putting her superfan skills into action, Utage supports Tamon through this difficult time in his career. Though dealing with Tamon's wildly shifting moods tests even her fangirl limits, Utage refuses to let her idol fail. With Utage's unrelenting devotion propping him up, can Tamon overcome his insecurities? Or will the pressures of stardom prove too much for even his most dedicated fan to handle? Overflowing with offbeat humor and idol worship gone wild, this story goes behind the scenes to reveal the human side of fame.",
