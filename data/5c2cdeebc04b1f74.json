  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hana wa Saku, Shura no Gotoku centers around Hana, a passionate high school reader living on the small island of Tonaru. With a tiny population of just 600, Tonaru is a close-knit community where Hana regularly reads aloud to entertain the local children. When Mizuki, president of the school's broadcasting club, witnesses how Hana manages to capture an audience with her expressive storytelling, she invites Hana to join the club. Though initially hesitant to step outside her comfort zone, Hana is excited by the prospect of finding a wider audience for her readings. As Hana spends more time with the broadcasting club members, experiencing many firsts along the way, she deepens her existing love of literature while discovering new friendships and talents. Over time, Hana's infectious passion for reading spreads through the broadcasting club and across the island.",
