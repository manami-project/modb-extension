  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As autumn leaves turn crimson, a grieving mother mourns the loss of her young son. Desperate to regain his presence, she removes the boy's shadow and clutches it tightly to her breast as she flees into the night. Seeking solace, she encounters a mysterious figure who offers her a fateful bargain: if the shadow remains intact until the trees bloom again, her beloved child will return. What ensues is a poignant tale of a mother's devotion as she protects her son's shadow through the bitter winter. Though the task proves painfully grueling, sustaining her is the enduring flame of hope - hope that with the spring blossoms will come her child's laughter once more. Captured in vivid animation, this anime explores the deepest bonds of love and sacrifice in the face of tragedy. At its emotional core, it is a story that celebrates a parent's unconditional affection for their child and the lengths one will go to keep a glimmer of that love alive.",
