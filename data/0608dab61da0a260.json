  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Himeko and Chikane seem destined to be together. Though they come from very different backgrounds, a special bond unites them. Little do they know, their connection runs deeper than friendship - they are reincarnated priestesses with a sacred duty to reseal the dark god Orochi, whose monstrous followers now threaten the world. On their shared birthday, disaster strikes. Orochi's agents attack, corrupting those closest to the girls. When hope seems lost, Himeko and Chikane awaken ancient powers within themselves - the solar and lunar magic of their past lives. Though deeply shaken, their ordeal has only begun. More fearsome trials await, even from former friends. Yet if they can rediscover their bond, the light of sun and moon may prevail once more. United by fate across lifetimes, Himeko and Chikane must stand together. Only their combined strength can lock away primal darkness and preserve all they hold dear. Love and loyalty will be tested as the seal they placed on Orochi in antiquity must be renewed. Though the path is perilous, these priestess souls may light the way towards hope again.",
