    "text": "One day, high school student Nijihara Ink, a petite and academically gifted girl with a particular knack for English, stumbles upon a peculiar talking duck named Arks Sheldart Elbyas. Originally a mage from a magical realm, Arks has been exiled to the human world in the form of a duck. He bestows upon Ink a magical cell phone that transforms her into Pastel Ink, a magical girl with the mission to help those in need.\n\nInk, who harbors a secret crush on her classmate Nao Tezuka, sees this newfound identity as an opportunity to assist him with his English studies without revealing her true feelings. As Pastel Ink, she approaches Nao, offering her support and guidance in his academic pursuits.\n\nHowever, trouble arises when Arks' nemesis, Karks, appears in the form of a cat, granting Ink's friend Sumi-chan the ability to transform as well. Amidst this magical rivalry, a mysterious magical girl with a vendetta against Arks emerges, determined to thwart his good deeds at every turn. As Ink navigates the challenges of high school, love, and her newfound magical responsibilities, she embarks on a series of adventures as the enchanting Magical Teacher Pastel Ink.",
