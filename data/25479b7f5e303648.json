  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's a challenging time for seasoned Federation soldier Johnny Rico, as he finds himself demoted and tasked with training a lackluster group of Martian recruits on a remote satellite station. The Martian population, comfortable in their perceived safety, have little interest in the ongoing bug war, leading to a relaxed and unmotivated batch of new troopers. However, when the bugs unexpectedly launch an attack on Mars, the ill-prepared inhabitants are caught off guard. With the Federation's main fleet engaged elsewhere, Rico and his undertrained recruits are the only defense Mars has left. Amidst the chaos, Sky Marshall Amy Snapp seizes the opportunity to execute her own mysterious plans for power. Can Rico rise to the challenge and save Mars from the bug invasion? Only time will tell.",
