    "text": "Swords once clashed in the era of warfare, but now, they've taken on a new form as the 'Mitsurugi' - maidens embodying the spirit of ancient blades. After vowing to live in harmony following the Battle of Sekigahara, these Mitsurugi find themselves in an alternate Meiji Era, three centuries later, facing a new enemy that threatens peace. With their maid outfits concealing their true power, they prepare to bring about a significant change through rigorous training and fierce battles, marking the beginning of a new chapter in their storied existence.",
