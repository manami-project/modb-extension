  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the dystopian landscape of the Far East in 2071, the once thriving civilization has been reduced to ruins by enigmatic creatures known as Aragami. Emerging in the early 2050s, these life forms exhibit an insatiable hunger for all life on Earth and an uncanny ability to adapt, rendering traditional weaponry useless. As humanity teeters on the brink of oblivion, a glimmer of hope emerges in the form of God Eatersâ€”elite warriors armed with God Arcs, bio-weapons infused with Oracle cells. Among these brave warriors is Lenka Utsugi, a unique God Eater capable of transforming his God Arc into both a blade and a gun. As a member of the Fenrir organization, Lenka stands as one of humanity's last lines of defense against the relentless onslaught of Aragami, battling to reclaim a world consumed by these monstrous deities. Based on the popular video game series by Bandai Namco Entertainment, the anime adaptation of GOD EATER is brought to life by the talented team at ufotable and directed by Takayuki Hirao.",
