    "text": "Empire of the Great General of Darkness, hailing from the subterranean realm of Mycenae, launches a sudden and ruthless attack on Earth. Their objective: to eradicate the Mazinger Army and eliminate its pilot, Koji Kabuto. As cities crumble under the onslaught of seven formidable generals and their legions of Warrior Beasts, Koji finds himself in a desperate race against time. With Archduke Gorgon hot on his heels, Koji must outmaneuver his relentless pursuer and ascend to the cockpit of the mighty Mazinkaiser. As a crimson glow illuminates the sky above Mt. Fuji, Koji prepares to face the greatest battle of his life against the feared leader Ankoku Daishogun and his marauding forces. The fate of the world rests on Koji's shoulders, as he stands as humanity's last hope against the encroaching darkness.",
