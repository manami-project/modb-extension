This army of seven Mikene generals and their warrior beasts launch devastating attacks around the world with the goal of conquering Earth. As cities fall and the Mazinger Army struggles to withstand the Mikene onslaught, Koji is targeted by Archduke Gorgon who aims to eliminate him before he can pilot the powerful Mazinkaiser. With civilization under threat, Koji races against time to reach the Mazinkaiser as humanity's last hope rests on his ability to defeat the Mikene empire and its merciless leader. The fate of the world hangs in the balance as Koji heads into a epic battle against the Mikene forces, determined to stop their campaign of terror. The red glow over Mount Fuji signals the greatest battle in history is about to begin.",
