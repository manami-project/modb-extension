    "text": "He artsick and disillusioned, 28-year-old Saeki Koushirou trudges through his mundane life after his partner falls out of love with him. Working as a wedding planner, the irony of his loveless existence isn't lost on him. But one day, a serendipitous encounter with a high school student, Kohinata Nanoka, sparks an inexplicable connection that stirs his dormant emotions.\n\nThe two share a heart-to-heart at an amusement park, confessing their own heartbreaks, only to later discover that Nanoka is none other than Koushirou's long-lost younger sister. The estranged product of divorced parents, Koushirou hasn't seen his sister or mother in years, living only with his father. Now, Nanoka is set to stay with Koushirou and their father while attending a nearby high school.\n\nAs they navigate their newfound relationship, the lingering feelings in Koushirou's heart threaten to complicate their already delicate bond. Will they be able to resist the allure of their taboo connection and find solace in their reunion, or will societal norms and their own emotions lead them down a path less traveled?",
