  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In 2014, aliens known as \"Peddlers\" arrive on Earth and offer advanced humanoid robots called \"Exoframes\" in exchange for limestone. These robots are controlled by the pilot's consciousness and are extremely versatile, cheap, and easy to operate. Initially, Exoframes are used for civilian purposes like farming and construction. However, their potential as weapons soon becomes apparent when a group of farmers use them to fend off tanks and soldiers. This discovery sparks an arms race, as nations compete to weaponize Exoframe technology and gain military supremacy. Beyond warfare capabilities, Exoframes also threaten to fundamentally alter human civilization and existing power structures due to their disruptive potential across industries. As Exoframe usage spreads rapidly across the globe, humanity enters a period of great change and uncertainty about what the future may hold in this new era marked by aliens and their technology.",
