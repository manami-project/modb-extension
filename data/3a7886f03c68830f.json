    "text": "Sora Kurumatani is a short but passionate high school basketball player who inherits his love for the sport from his mother. He makes a promise to her that he will win his first high school tournament. However, when Sora joins the basketball club at Kuzuryuu High School, he finds that it has turned into a hangout for delinquents rather than a place for basketball. The club members, including the skilled Chiaki and Momoharu Hanazono twins, have lost interest in playing basketball. But Sora is determined to revive their passion for the sport. In a match against the club members, Sora's quickness and persistence impress them. Gradually, his pure love of basketball rekindles their burnt-out spirit. Together, they set out to transform the basketball club back into a place for athletic competition. With his unwavering drive and love for the game, Sora hopes to fulfill his vow to his mother. Alongside the former delinquents turned teammates, he trains relentlessly with his eyes set on dominating his first high school basketball tournament.",
