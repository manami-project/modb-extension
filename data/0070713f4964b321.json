  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Tomoe's older brother, Souichi, is a stern individual with a deep-seated disdain for same-sex relationships, a sentiment that only intensifies when his brother elopes with another man to California, where same-sex marriage is legal. Souichi's life takes an unexpected turn when he finds himself spending more time with his junior, Tetsuhiro, who harbors deep feelings for him. Despite Souichi's homophobic views, Tetsuhiro's affection only grows stronger, leading him to question if he can ever gather the courage to confess his love. As they navigate through their complex relationship, an unforeseen event forces Souichi to confront his feelings towards Tetsuhiro and reevaluate his stance on love and relationships. Will Tetsuhiro's love be strong enough to change Souichi's views, or will their relationship remain unrequited? \"Koisuru Boukun\" is a poignant exploration of love, acceptance, and the power of personal growth.",
