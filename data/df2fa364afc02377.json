  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The year is 320 and the Kingdom of Pars is embroiled in war with the neighboring Lusitanian Empire. Pars is ruled by the belligerent King Andragoras III while his son, the young Prince Arslan, is his kind and different heir apparent. When betrayal allows the Lusitanian army to decimate Pars, Prince Arslan is forced to flee his conquered capital city of Ecbatana. Now on the run, Arslan hopes to one day take back his kingdom. By his side is the respected General Daryun, loyal to Arslan in his darkest hour. However, greater dangers lurk. Other kingdoms watch hungrily, ready to take Ecbatana for themselves. And the mastermind behind Lusitania's victory hides behind a silver mask, keeping secret a truth that threatens Arslan's succession. Though Pars faces invasion and Arslan's crown is at risk, the Prince resolves to find new allies and the strength within himself to reclaim his rightful place. Aided by Daryun’s wisdom and sword, Arslan’s journey will forge him into a king worthy of ruling Pars in this time of war.",
