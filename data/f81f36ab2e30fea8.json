    "text": "Two years have passed since the God Blader's Cup, and the world of Beyblading is evolving with the introduction of Turbo Beys. Valt Aoi, the reigning world champion, has just upgraded his Bey with the help of the best technician available. On his journey home, he crosses paths with Aiga Akaba, a young boy who has grown up in the heart of nature. Inspired by an impromptu battle with Valt, Aiga sets his sights on becoming the world's strongest Blader.\n\nUsing the same technology that was used to upgrade Valt's Bey, Aiga and his younger sister construct a unique Bey of their own - Z Achilles. After a friendly match between Valt and Aiga, Aiga realizes the potential of his new Bey and decides to embark on a journey to challenge powerful opponents, improve his skills, and ultimately dethrone Valt Aoi as the World Champion. This marks the beginning of Aiga's epic adventures and intense battles on his quest to become the No.1 Blader in the world.",
