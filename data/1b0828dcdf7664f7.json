  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, in a serene, post-apocalyptic Yokohama, Alpha, an abandoned android, spends her days managing a quaint, secluded caf√©, eagerly awaiting her owner's return. In this flooded, sand-covered world where advanced technology once thrived, only a handful of humans and robots remain. Alpha's mundane existence takes a turn when she receives a mysterious package containing a camera and a heartfelt message from her absent owner, urging her to capture the beauty of life. As Alpha embarks on her photographic journey, she discovers the charm in the little moments and forms touching connections with the few people around her, including the wise old man from the nearby gasoline stand and his curious grandson, Takahiro. Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou is a gentle, introspective tale that invites viewers to appreciate life's simple pleasures through the lens of an android's newfound perspective.",
