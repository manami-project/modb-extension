  "synopsis": {
    "text": "One day, ordinary civilian Yoshichika Tsurugi's peaceful life is shattered when his world, Septpia, is threatened by powerful beings from the legendary land of Tetra-Heaven. After a century-long war, these defeated gods seek refuge in the human realm, wreaking havoc and forcing the government to take action. To protect its citizens, the Another Logic Counter Agency (ALCA) employs Logicalistsâ€”unique individuals capable of forming trances with goddesses from Tetra-Heaven, granting them extraordinary abilities.\n\nYoshichika, having lost his Logic powers two years ago, finds himself in the midst of an attack at a shopping mall. It is here that he encounters the beautiful goddess Athena, who holds the key to restoring his lost Logic. With his powers reawakened, Yoshichika forms a contract with Athena and joins ALCA alongside other Logicalists. Together, they must combine their strengths and use their newly-acquired abilities to protect their world and put an end to the looming threats. The future of Septpia now rests in the hands of these brave warriors and their divine allies.",
