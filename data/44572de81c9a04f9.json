  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yunaâ€™s family shrine has been the tranquil haven where Matoi Sumeragi, a second-year middle school student, has found solace while working part-time as a shrine maiden. Separated from her mother at a tender age, Matoi has been living with her grandparents, but recently moved in with her detective father, Shingo. Craving an ordinary and peaceful life, Matoi's world turns upside down when she and her best friend, Yuma Kusanagi, stumble upon a devastated shrine and Yuma's injured parents.\n\nAs the next shrine maiden and a member of a family that has performed exorcisms for generations, Yuma attempts a 'Divine Possession' ritual to subdue a deranged man connected to an ongoing investigation by Matoi's father. However, the unexpected occurs when Matoi, not Yuma, gains the power to wield a god and banish evil spirits.\n\nIn this new reality, Matoi must navigate her life between school, friendships, and battling malevolent forces. As she yearns for her once-normal life, Matoi embarks on a journey to master her divine abilities and protect those she holds dear. Joined by allies like the experienced exorcist Claris and IATO agent Haruka, Matoi will face the challenges ahead to restore her cherished peaceful existence.",
