    "text": "Ai Enma, known as the Hell Girl, has an eternal duty to ferry cursed souls to Hell through her magical website, the Hell Correspondence. Those who access it can enter the name of someone they bear a grudge against. At midnight, Ai will appear before them and offer to drag their tormentor to Hell - but only if they agree to have their own soul condemned after death as payment. \n\nIn this latest chapter, Ai continues carrying out her grim work with her enigmatic companions. However, they have noticed a mysterious young girl following them recently. This amnesiac child seems curiously drawn to bear witness to Ai's tasks, questioning the purpose behind the Hell Girl's role. As the girl persists in her unexplained observations, tensions rise over her unknown identity and connection to the damned workings of Hell Link.",
