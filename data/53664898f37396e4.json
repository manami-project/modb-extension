    "text": "Yui's ordinary life takes a dramatic turn when her father sends her to live with the enigmatic Sakamaki brothers in a secluded mansion. The brothers, all of whom are vampires, initially confuse Yui's arrival, but they soon realize that she is meant to be their new 'sacrificial bride.' As Yui grapples with her new reality, she must navigate the brothers' sadistic tendencies and carnal desires, all while uncovering the truth behind her father's decision to send her there. With each passing day, Yui becomes more entangled in the brothers' web of madness and ecstasy, and she must learn to survive in this new world where she is both a captive and a source of temptation. As she delves deeper into the secrets of the Sakamaki family, Yui also begins to uncover hidden truths about herself and her own identity.",
