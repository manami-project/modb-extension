    "text": "Manatsu Natsuumi moves from her small hometown island to the big city of Aozora to start middle school. On her first day, she meets Laura, a mermaid princess searching for the legendary Pretty Cure warriors. Laura reveals that her underwater mermaid kingdom of Grand Ocean has been attacked by the evil Witch of Delays. This witch has stolen the motivation power of Laura's people, leaving the kingdom vulnerable. The witch now threatens to steal the human world's motivation as well. Just then, the witch's minions attack Laura. To Laura's surprise, Manatsu awakens as one of the Pretty Cure warriors - Cure Summer! Along with other girls who transform into Pretty Cures like Cure Coral and Cure Flamingo, Manatsu vows to protect both her new city and Laura's kingdom from the dangerous witch. Balancing her school life in the big city with her duties as a magical girl warrior, Manatsu must dig deep to find the motivation needed to defeat the Witch of Delays. With the support of her fellow tropical-themed Pretty Cures, she is determined to save the underwater mermaid kingdom and protect the human world from having its motivation stolen away.",
