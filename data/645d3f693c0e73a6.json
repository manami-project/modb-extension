    "text": "Sayako Arashiyama, a ghost from World War II, encounters Yasaka Hajime, a 13-year-old boy, in a quaint café during his summer vacation at his grandfather's house. The young boy finds himself instantly smitten with her, leading him to work part-time at the café to be closer to her. Little does he know, Sayako possesses the ability to travel back in time with his help, and he soon becomes entangled in her supernatural adventures.\n\nAs Hajime's life takes a turn for the extraordinary, he meets other ghosts like Kaya and time-travelers like Kamigamo Jun, each with their own mysterious pasts. Together, they navigate through time, facing challenges such as saving Sayako from two ghosts, Yayoi and Kanako, who drain her existence for their own survival.\n\nHajime's summer becomes a whirlwind of emotions, filled with moped races, strawberry bombs, and time-traveling escapades. Along the way, he learns that the café's employees have secrets of their own, making his journey even more intriguing and unpredictable. As Hajime's bond with Sayako deepens, he finds himself not only falling in love but also fighting to protect her from the perils of time travel.",
