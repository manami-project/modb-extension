  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Rin, a lively girl with a hearty appetite, resides in a lush, rural village, while Finis, a melancholic songstress, spends her days in isolation within the grand royal palace of a thriving metropolis. Both young women possess an extraordinary gift, a power unique to them alone - the ability to heal, generate water, and manipulate wind through the magic of their songs. As destiny guides them, they embark on challenging journeys, harnessing their melodious powers. However, as war casts a dark shadow over their kingdom, their miraculous songs risk being tainted by innocent blood. Amidst the echoes of silent screams and the loss of loved ones, their paths converge. Will their final melody resonate with despair, hope, or something else entirely?",
