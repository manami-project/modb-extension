  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Taeko Okajima, a 27-year-old office worker in Tokyo, finds herself yearning for a break from the mundane city life and her mother's constant reminders about her marital status. She embarks on a journey to the serene countryside, visiting her relatives and their safflower farm. As she immerses herself in the tranquil rural life, she befriends a young farmer named Toshio and forms deep connections with the villagers and family members.\n\nDuring her stay, Taeko's memories of her childhood and adolescence come flooding back, transporting her to the days of her school life, first love, and the trials of growing up. As she delves deeper into her past, she begins to reflect on her present life and contemplates the path she has chosen. The stark contrast between her urban and rural experiences forces her to reassess her dreams and aspirations, ultimately leading her to question the kind of person she truly wants to be.\n\n\"Only Yesterday\" is a heartwarming and poignant tale of self-discovery, nostalgia, and personal growth, as Taeko navigates the complexities of her past and present to find her true self.",
