    "text": "Lala, a princess from the planet Deviluke, continues her determined pursuit to marry Rito, an average high school boy on Earth. Though Rito harbors feelings for his childhood friend Haruna, Lala employs various antics and inventions to win his affection. Complicating matters further, Lala's younger twin sisters Nana and Momo come to live in Rito's house, alongside his sister Mikan. More chaos ensues as Lala's unpredictable gadgets wreak havoc and Yami, an assassin, aims to kill Rito due to a contract. Rito deals with uncertain love, punishments for accidental perversions, and the new family members crowding his home. Despite the chaos, Rito questions his feelings for Lala as she starts admitting her love. But alien customs, intergalactic politics, bounty hunters chasing Lala, and general mayhem continue causing problems. Rito faces body switches, alien skunks, a shapeshifting bathroom, and disastrous sleepovers. Through all the insanity, Rito tries surviving life with Lala while managing his lingering feelings for Haruna.",
