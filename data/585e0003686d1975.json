  "synopsis": {
    "text": "With the world once plagued by the malevolent Dark Lord Hadlar, a brave swordsman known only as 'the hero' and his companions united to restore peace. Years later, on the tranquil Delmurin Island, where monsters freed from Hadlar's control now reside, a young human boy named Dai dreams of becoming a hero. Raised by the gentle monster Brass, Dai's life takes a drastic turn when Hadlar is revived, threatening the harmony of the world once more.\n\nAs Hadlar's return brings chaos, Dai's aspirations of heroism are put to the test when he encounters Leona, a princess in need of protection, and Avan, a legendary hero trainer. Under Avan's tutelage, Dai discovers his hidden powers and learns the truth about the hero who once defeated Hadlar.\n\nBut Hadlar's resurgence is not an isolated event; he now serves an even greater evil, the dark King Vearn. With the stakes higher than ever, Dai and his friends embark on a perilous journey to avenge their fallen mentor and restore peace to the world. As they confront their destiny, Dai's adventure to become a true hero unfolds.",
