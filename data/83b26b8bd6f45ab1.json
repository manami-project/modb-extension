    "text": "Mikaela and Yuuichirou Hyakuya, two young boys, are among the few survivors of a mysterious virus that has wiped out all humans over the age of 13. As the world crumbles, vampires emerge from the shadows to enslave the remaining human population, treating them as nothing more than livestock. The boys, along with their fellow orphans, are captured and forced to live in a dark, underground city, where they are subjected to the cruel whims of their vampire overlords.\n\nDetermined to break free from their chains, Mikaela devises a daring escape plan. However, the attempt is thwarted, and Yuuichirou is the only survivor. Rescued by the Moon Demon Company, a military unit dedicated to exterminating vampires, Yuuichirou vows to avenge his fallen family and destroy the monsters that have enslaved humanity.\n\nYears later, as a member of the Japanese Imperial Demon Army, Yuuichirou's quest for vengeance is fraught with danger and heartache. In a world where the odds are stacked against him, Yuuichirou must fight for friendship, loyalty, and the future of mankind. Will he be able to exact his revenge and free humanity from the clutches of the vampires, or will he lose everything he holds dear in the process? Join Yuuichirou in his epic battle against the forces of darkness in \"Owari no Seraph.\"",
