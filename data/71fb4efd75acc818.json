    "text": "Clover, Heart, Spade, and Diamond - the idol group Shugo Chara Egg - kick off and close the show with their dazzling cosplay performances. This season introduces a pair of intriguing transfer students, Rikka Hiiragi and Hikaru, who shake up the Guardian scene at Seiyo Academy Elementary School. Rikka, a cheerful and energetic girl, possesses a unique ability to see, communicate, and even collect X-Eggs, despite not having a Guardian Character of her own. As the current Guardians face graduation, they recruit Rikka and Hikaru as Guardian Apprentices. Determined to prove herself, Rikka strives to become a full-fledged Guardian, even while hiding a secret about her mysterious powers.\n\nThe third season of Shugo Chara!!! Dokki Doki brings a fresh blend of entertainment, combining variety show-style shorts, such as Shugo Chara! Pucchi Puchi, with the main 11-12 minute animation that continues the story from season 2. Each 24-25 minute episode is filled with excitement, laughter, and captivating live-action segments that complement the main animation. With new challenges, friendships, and adventures, the Guardians and their Apprentices are ready to face whatever comes their way.",
