  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Wakashi Hiyoshi, the next captain of Hyoutei Academy's tennis team, and Akaya Kirihara, the lone second-year member of Rikkai University-Affiliated Middle School's tennis team, face immense pressure to carry on their respective teams' legacies. The Atobe Group has built a new tennis court in Kanagawa and has invited Rikkai to play against Hyotei in an exhibition match, marking the first time the two teams will face off. This match will be the last chance for the third-year members of both teams to play with their underclassmen before they graduate. As the second-year aces train rigorously to prove themselves worthy of succeeding their captains, the third-years impart their feelings to their successors. The future of both Hyoutei and Rikkai rests on the shoulders of these ambitious second-years, who are determined to overthrow their captains' legacies and lead their teams to glory once again. This original story, which takes place after the U-17 World Cup, was not previously depicted in the manga.",
