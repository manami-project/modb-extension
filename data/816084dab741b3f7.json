  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Gotoubun no Hanayome anime tells the story of Futaro Uesugi, a studious high school boy who takes on a tutoring job for the five Nakano sisters. The Nakano sisters - Ichika, Nino, Miku, Yotsuba and Itsuki - are quintuplets who struggle academically and have difficult personalities. As Futaro spends time tutoring the sisters, he gets to know their individual quirks and challenges. Though they initially despise studying under Futaro, the sisters slowly begin to open up to him over time. Set in their last year of high school, the story follows Futaro helping the sisters improve their grades before graduation. During the summer break before their final school term, Futaro takes time off from tutoring the Nakano sisters to intensely focus on his own exam preparation. The sisters miss his company and tutelage during this period. The story then depicts an unexpected phone call from Futaro that delights the sisters, sparking a heartwarming turn of events. Beyond the original TV anime, an additional anime project called Gotoubun no Hanayome âˆ½ adapts untold stories from the manga source material. Notably, this new anime closely examines Yotsuba Nakano's perspective, providing meaningful insights into her inner world and past experiences.",
