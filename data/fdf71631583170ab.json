  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a distant galaxy, an extraterrestrial rock band thrills crowds with their energetic music and dazzling concerts. But in the midst of a show, masked figures invade and kidnap the four band members along with their instruments. The band is taken to Earth, where an evil music producer brainwashes them into obeying his commands. Marketed as a human group called the Crescendolls, the band rapidly rises to stardom on Earth under the producer's control. Back home, the band's biggest fan named Seph falls in love with Stella, the band's beautiful bass player, and receives a distress signal sent by the band during the kidnapping. Determined to rescue his beloved band, Seph travels across galaxies to Earth as their one hope for freedom. It is revealed the band has been at the center of a larger scheme beyond just fame and fortune. This silent, animated film paired with the house music of Daft Punk tells a continuous story of interstellar rescue, evil schemes, and the power of music. By accompanying the visuals with songs from their album \"Discovery,\" Daft Punk has created an innovative intergalactic musical.",
