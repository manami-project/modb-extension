  "synopsis": {
    "text": "As a special edition, \"Initial D Battle Stage\" offers a thrilling recap of all street races from the two TV series and movie, with an exciting new race added to the mix. Instead of reusing clips, the special treats viewers to a visual feast by re-animating all original CG car and background footage with cutting-edge computer graphics rendering. Enhancing the adrenaline-pumped racing scenes is an all-new Super Eurobeat soundtrack, accompanied by expert commentary from renowned 'drift racer' Tsuchiya Keiichi.\n\nAt the heart of the action is Takumi, a natural-born driver who finds himself reluctantly thrust into the world of street racing. Despite his initial disinterest, Takumi rises to the challenge as Mt. Akina's reigning downhill racer, defending his territory against formidable opponents. With each race, his passion for racing ignites, and his skills behind the wheel of his seemingly underpowered AE86 evolve. Can Takumi maintain his winning streak against seasoned drivers and their superior vehicles?\n\n\"Initial D Battle Stage\" focuses on delivering high-octane racing action, providing a summary of the races from the \"Initial D\" series without delving into historical context.",
