    "text": "Dorohedoro: Ma no Omake offers a glimpse into the daily lives of the characters from Dorohedoro when they are not caught up in the conflict between sorcerers and humans. Spanning six short stories, we see the cast in more lighthearted tales of masked balls, failed magic rituals, street food mishaps, portrait sessions, dance parties, and cooking together. Kaiman and his partner Nikaidou try conjuring a mask demon with little success, then later team up to make gyozas. En forces his family to participate in a strange masquerade ball tradition involving partner dances. A young girl named Ebisu wants her portrait taken by the mansion's mysterious photographer. Nikaidou resorts to selling gyozas on the street to make ends meet and meets a kind cafe owner. And the Gyoza Fairy oversees the Hungry Bug's renowned gyozas, ensuring both quality and appreciation. Though more comedic and slice-of-life focused, these stories provide additional insights into the characters and world of Dorohedoro. Their lighthearted nature serves as an entertaining contrast to the darker main storyline. With creative concepts and humor, Dorohedoro: Ma no Omake invites both existing fans and newcomers into the lives of these distinctive characters.",
