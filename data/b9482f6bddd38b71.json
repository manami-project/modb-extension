  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Every person lives in their own little world, full of passions, wonders, and questions. For Akio Honjō, his fun world revolves around talking anime with his best friends Yoshida and Watanabe. Yet Akio also wonders about the world of his cheerful classmate Juri Makina, who always smiles while surrounded by her gorgeous friends. One day, Akio discovers he can perfectly replay a soothing piano melody he once heard Juri play on her phone. This shared love of music unexpectedly brings their two worlds together. However, Akio soon realizes understanding someone's inner world is more complex than simply sharing interests. As Akio spends more time with Juri, he strives to truly know her thoughts, emotions, and experiences—not just her outward persona. Through this budding friendship rooted in music, Akio gains insight into Juri's world, though her complex depths continue to intrigue him. Their story explores the bridges that art can build between people, hinting at the intellectual and emotional truths art can unveil within ourselves and each other.",
