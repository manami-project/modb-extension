  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Among the diverse worlds of 34 lively students in Classroom 2-1, Akio Honjou's universe brims with animated discussions about the latest anime with his friends Yoshida, Watanabe, and others. It's a cozy and enjoyable realm, yet Akio can't help but ponder about the world of Juri Makina, who always seems to be smiling and encircled by her attractive friends on the other side of the classroom. One day, Akio finds himself stepping into Juri's world, but the experience turns out to be far from straightforward. As a high school student with a remarkable ability to remember any piece of music after hearing it just once, Akio discovers that the key to understanding Juri's world might lie in a captivating piano melody. This heartwarming tale is part of Anime Mirai 2014, a project supported by the Japanese government's Agency of Cultural Affairs to nurture aspiring animators.",
