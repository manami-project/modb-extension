    "text": "Later in the summer, Funco, Ichiroku, Elle, and Sig embark on a camping adventure nestled in the heart of the mountains. Their days are filled with the simple joys of fishing in the nearby river, playfully skipping rocks, and even discovering a hidden hot spring for a relaxing soak. As the sun sets, the group gathers around to share a laugh and smash a watermelon. After a day of bonding and creating memories, the girls cozy up in their sleeping bags, with Funco and Sig making a heartfelt promise to always stand by each other's side.",
