    "text": "Earth's fate hangs in the balance as Kenji Koiso, an 11th-grade math whiz and part-time virtual world moderator, embarks on an unforgettable summer adventure. Invited by the enchanting Natsuki Shinohara, the most admired girl in school, Kenji joins her at her family's grand estate to work a summer job. However, his job description takes an unexpected turn when he's asked to pose as Natsuki's fianc√© in front of her eccentric family members, who have gathered to celebrate their matriarch's 90th birthday.\n\nAs Kenji navigates the complexities of his new role, he receives a cryptic math puzzle on his phone. Unable to resist the allure of a challenge, Kenji solves the equation, inadvertently triggering a catastrophic hack into OZ - a virtual world that controls every aspect of modern life. With the world plunged into chaos, Kenji and his newfound \"family\" must race against time to stop the hacker and save humanity from the brink of destruction. Little does Kenji know that his love for math might just be the key to saving the world.",
