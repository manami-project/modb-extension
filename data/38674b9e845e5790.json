    "text": "The anime focuses on the side stories and aftermath of the Donten ni Warau series. Set one year after a climactic battle with a gigantic snake called the 'Orochi', the story follows Tenka Kumou, who was paralyzed in the final fight. Once a key member of the government's battle squad, Tenka has now withdrawn from society. However, his younger brothers Soramaru and Chutaro discover his whereabouts. Additionally, the anime will explore hidden details of Tenka's past through flashbacks. Moving forward, it seems his brothers and former squadmates Sousei and Kiiko will try to reconnect with the reclusive Tenka. By shedding light on unrevealed backstories and the characters' lives after their big battle, this anime aims to provide closure and a deeper look into the Donten ni Warau world.",
