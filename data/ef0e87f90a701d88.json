    "text": "It's no small feat to be chosen as the Royal Tutor in the kingdom of Grannzreich, a role reserved for the nation's top educator. Enter Heine Wittgenstein, a man of remarkable intellect and captivating charm, who, despite his petite stature, commands respect. His task? To prepare one of the four princes to ascend the throne. But these are no ordinary royals. Each prince possesses a unique and challenging personality that has sent previous tutors running for the hills.\n\nFrom the flirtatious charms of Licht, the youngest prince, to the immature antics of Leonhard, the second in line, Heine's job is anything but ordinary. Add to the mix Bruno, the studious third prince, and Kai, the reserved eldest, and you've got a royal recipe for chaos.\n\nAs Heine navigates the complex dynamics of his new students, he must also confront the shadows of his own past and the looming threats to the kingdom's peace. Will his unconventional methods and resilient spirit be enough to connect with the princes and guide them towards their royal destinies? Join Heine in this comedic journey of education, royal intrigue, and personal growth.",
