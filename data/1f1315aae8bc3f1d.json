  "synopsis": {
    "text": "When a curious Shinigami expresses interest in the human realm, Ryuk recounts his own experiences and the tale of Light Yagami, a gifted young man who discovered Ryuk's misplaced Death Note. This supernatural notebook grants its user the power to kill anyone whose name is written within, as long as the user can envision their face. Seizing this dark opportunity, Light embarks on a mission to cleanse the world of evil and create a utopia. As mysterious deaths among criminals attract the attention of the authorities, they enlist the help of L, a world-famous detective. The ensuing battle of wits between Light and L becomes the focus of \"Genshisuru Kami (Visions of a God),\" a two-hour Death Note special edited from Ryuk's perspective, featuring new dialogue, soundtrack, and additional animation.\n\nIn \"Eru o Tsugu Mono (L's Successors),\" the story continues with the power struggle between Light and L's successors, Mello and Near. This special delves into the complex and intense conflicts that arise as each character vies for control and the truth. With the stakes higher than ever, the future of humanity hangs in the balance.",
