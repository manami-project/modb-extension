  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Naho is an 11-year-old girl who has had to grow up fast after the death of her mother. She now looks after her 2-year-old brother Jun while her father works, meaning she misses out on playing with friends. Struggling with these responsibilities, Naho meets a mysterious man named Kotaro who claims to be a \"Dreamball Dealer\" and offers to take her to other worlds where she can escape her troubles. At first, Naho is transported into joyful dreams where she enjoys time with her friends. But soon the dreams take darker turns, plunging her into her parents' private memories and even her baby brother Jun's subconscious. Confused by these visions, Naho grapples with complex feelings about her life caring for Jun. Though part of her wishes for freedom, she also harbors guilt over resenting her innocent brother. When Kotaro reappears, Naho must decide what to ask of him - does she want to change her own dreams, send her brother away forever, or accept the bittersweet realities of her role as Jun's surrogate mother? As both sister and mother now, Naho realizes she must look within and determine what she truly desires in her complicated young life.",
