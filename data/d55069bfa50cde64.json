  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Under a canopy of countless stars, casting a gentle glow, a young girl embarks on a solitary journey through a realm suspended between the veil of night and the break of day. This enchanting world, teeming with a myriad of solitudes, is neither bound by the present nor the future. What awaits her in this nocturnal voyage? This captivating narrative unfolds in the music video for Maaya Sakamoto's melodious track, \"Universe,\" a creative collaboration brought to life by Production I.G and Victor Entertainment. The song is a highlight of Sakamoto's 2007 album, \"30minutes night flight.\" In this magical realm, the girl encounters a vibrant town, alive with quirky characters and shimmering stars. She finds companionship and together, they dance amidst the twilight, while life continues its course around them.",
