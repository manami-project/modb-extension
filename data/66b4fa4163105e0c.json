  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Despite her plans to live a quiet high school life devoted to her overseas boyfriend, 15-year-old Kasumi Kishimoto finds herself in a whirlwind of unexpected chaos when she moves into her aunt's house. Instead of the peaceful residence she anticipated, Kasumi discovers that she'll be sharing her new home with four rambunctious male classmates. Among them is the mischievous Takasugi Yusaku, who inadvertently stumbles upon Kasumi during her bath time, marking the beginning of her tumultuous high school journey.\n\nAs Kasumi navigates through her days at Myoujou High School, she becomes entangled in a series of amusing escapades involving her eccentric housemates. From the lecherous Shin and the insatiable Takashi to the peculiar Makoto and the charming Yusaku, each boy brings a unique flavor to Kasumi's life. Amidst the excitement of classes, baseball matches, and the school's all-male cheerleading squad, Kasumi struggles to maintain her loyalty to her long-distance boyfriend. However, as she grows closer to her four housemates, she finds herself unwittingly falling for one of them, adding an extra layer of complexity to her already unpredictable high school experience.",
