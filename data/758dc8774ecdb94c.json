  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hime’s life is seemingly perfect, with top grades and a popular status, but beneath the surface, she's selfish and lazy. When an accident leaves Mai, a classmate, injured, Hime reluctantly steps in to cover Mai's shifts at Café Liebe, a café with a unique twist: the waitresses play the roles of students in a German boarding school, engaging in secret romantic liaisons. As Hime navigates this unfamiliar world, she finds herself drawn to her co-worker, Mitsuki, who, despite her flirtatious behavior in front of customers, harbors a deep dislike for Hime. With her flawless image on the line, Hime must adapt to her new job while managing her burgeoning feelings for Mitsuki, all the while enduring Mitsuki's scorn. Will Hime be able to maintain her perfect façade, or will the challenges of Café Liebe reveal her true self?",
