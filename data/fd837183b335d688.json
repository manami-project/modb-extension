    "text": "Agent Aika, now a 19-year-old college student, finds herself in a future world predominantly submerged under water, juggling her studies with her training as an agent in Gozo's salvaging business. In an unexpected turn of events, Aika stumbles upon a series of strange occurrences at a nearby girls' academy, where the most attractive students are mysteriously disappearing, only to resurface as part of an enigmatic internal club controlled by an unknown entity.\n\nWith her curiosity piqued and her determination ignited by a personal encounter with the abductors, Aika seizes the opportunity to delve deeper when her former partners from R-16 decide to investigate the peculiar abductions. Going undercover, she teams up with Karen, whose peculiar habit of looking up defeated foes' skirts adds an unexpected twist to their mission.\n\nAs they probe deeper, Aika and Karen discover that the pristine white-clad school council is behind the abductions, using beams of light to capture the voluptuous girls for unknown purposes. The question remains: who are these villains, and what sinister motives lie behind their obsession with these shapely girls? Only Aika and her team can unravel this mystery in this action-packed, panty-flashing adventure.",
