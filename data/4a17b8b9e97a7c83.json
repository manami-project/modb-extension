  "synopsis": {
    "text": "For centuries, a mysterious group of ageless white-haired children called \"The Children of Befort\" have been spotted across Europe, searching for an unknown girl. In 2012, they arrive on a southern island called Papin Island, where they encounter Tohma, an athletic young martial artist. Tohma has been helping two runaway orphans - Helga and Chitto - from a nearby island called Chikao. When Helga is captured and brought back to the orphanage, Tohma and Chitto make a plan to rescue her. However, upon reaching Chikao, they discover government agents have also come, searching for an escaped prisoner. As Tohma becomes more involved with the strange white-haired children, he learns a startling secret about Helga's true origins. She is connected to The Children of Befort, who have spent centuries traveling across time and space to find her. Now, in present-day Papin Island, centuries of mystery and search converge upon Helga, Tohma and Chitto, destined to forever change their lives.",
