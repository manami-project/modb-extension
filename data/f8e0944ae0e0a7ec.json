    "text": "Hundred s of races, including the Human Race, were once subjugated by the Heaven Fighting Race, self-proclaimed \"Gods,\" who invaded the Spirit Realm and other secret dimensions thirty thousand years ago. After a brutal war, the Heaven Fighting Race was defeated and forced to retreat to the starry skies, leaving behind a legacy that faded into ancient legend. In the present era, an amnesiac youth with the Heaven Fighting Race's bloodline lies dormant in an ordinary household, waiting for the day his heritage awakens.\n\nIn the continent of Chilan, warriors and their Spirit Weapons are ranked according to their power, and families and clans adhere to a strict hierarchy. The Xuantian Union leads human warriors and the Evil Clan in a relentless battle against the Soul-devouring Beast on the Nether Battlefield. Qin Lie, a young man from Ling Town, finds himself entangled in a treacherous conspiracy while trying to protect his friends and loved ones. As the danger escalates, the hidden powers within his veins begin to stir, revealing his true potential.",
