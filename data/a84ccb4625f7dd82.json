    "text": "Mignon is a young boxer struggling to survive on the streets by participating in underground cage fights. Having lost his parents at a young age, he is dependent on his abusive coach who forces him to fight while also working as a mechanic. His only solace is the arena's doctor, Oh Young-One, who gently tends to Mignon's frequent injuries after matches. One night when returning to retrieve his forgotten gloves, Mignon discovers Young-One's shocking secret - he is actually a vampire. Despite the danger, Mignon refuses to abandon Young-One, the only one who has shown him true care and affection. Their bond grows into a romantic yet tumultuous relationship, offering escape and comfort amidst the chaos of Mignon's violent world. As the two navigate the complexities of an aggressive affair, they find momentary peace in each other's presence. Yet the realities of Mignon's brutal lifestyle and Young-One's monstrous nature threaten to destroy the precarious sanctuary they have built together. Their future remains uncertain in the darkness that lies beneath the bright city lights.",
