    "text": "Prince Bojji is the first-born son of King Bossu, ruler of the seventh-ranked kingdom. However, Bojji was born deaf and lacks any physical strength, leading others to see him as unfit to be king. But Bojji strives to prove himself, dreaming of becoming the world's greatest king one day. His life changes when he meets his first-ever friend - Kage, a literal shadow who somehow understands Bojji. Kage is a survivor of an assassinated clan who no longer kills, but gets by through stealing. As the story unfolds, Bojji comes of age meeting various people that enter his life, beginning with the fateful encounter with Kage. Despite being constantly looked down upon, Bojji is determined to overcome the doubts and fulfill his desire to be the best king he can be. With his unlikely friendship with Kage, Bojji starts building the foundations for this journey against all odds.",
