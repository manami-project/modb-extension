  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There is a chaotic romance brewing between Ataru Moroboshi, an unfaithful, unlucky, and lecherous human, and Lum, an alien princess clad in a tigerskin bikini with a temper as electric as her powers. The pair's tumultuous relationship is set against the backdrop of an alien invasion, where Earth's fate rests on Ataru's shoulders in a game of tag against Lum. Despite his less-than-stellar qualities, Ataru manages to win, but not without consequences. Lum misinterprets his victory celebration and believes they are now married, leading to a series of wild misadventures in the eccentric town of Tomobiki. Along with a diverse cast of bizarre characters, including a superhuman schoolgirl, a fire-breathing baby, and a gender-bending martial artist, Ataru and Lum's love story is anything but ordinary. Will Ataru's womanizing ways lead to the end of his relationship with Lum, or can he balance his love life while keeping Earth safe from alien invaders? Join the chaos in Urusei Yatsura and find out.",
