    "text": "Neighbour's Club members, in search of a fun and engaging activity, stumble upon an idea proposed by Kodaka: a collaborative story-writing endeavor. Each member is to contribute a section, continuing from where the last person left off. However, as unique perspectives and personal biases come into play, the story takes unexpected twists and turns, resulting in a bizarre and disjointed narrative. As the members attempt to one-up each other, the question remains - will this creative experiment ever culminate in a coherent conclusion? Join the Neighbour's Club on this chaotic and unpredictable literary adventure!",
