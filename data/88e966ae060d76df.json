  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Whether it's the soothing rhythm of the waves or the solitary thrill of the catch, high school student Takurou Mukoujima finds his peace in fishing at the pier. However, his tranquil fishing days take an unexpected turn when he hooks a peculiar creature: a mermaid named Muromi. Far from the serene image of mythical sirens, Muromi is a boisterous, eccentric character with a peculiar fondness for Takurou. To his dismay, every fishing trip now comes with Muromi's unpredictable antics and her equally quirky friends, including a forgetful harpy, a dolphin enthusiast, and a busty mermaid. As Takurou's quiet pier transforms into a gathering spot for mythical creatures, he finds himself longing for the simple joy of solitary fishing amidst the chaos of his new reality.",
