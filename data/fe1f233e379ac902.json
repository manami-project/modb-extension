    "text": "Some years into the future, the island of Midorijima, Japan, has been transformed by the powerful Toue Inc. into a luxurious haven known as Platinum Jail. While the affluent bask in its opulence, the less fortunate locals are relegated to the Old Residential District, left to fend for themselves. The island's most popular pastimes are 'Rib' and 'Rhyme' - Rib being a gritty turf war game, while Rhyme is an immersive virtual reality combat game, requiring an AI companion called an 'All-Mate' and a mediator known as an 'Usui'.\n\nAoba Seragaki, a resident of Midorijima, desires nothing more than a peaceful life with his grandmother and All-Mate, Ren. However, his tranquil existence is shattered when he is unwillingly dragged into a perilous Rhyme match. As rumors of vanishing Rib players swirl around the island, Aoba's hopes for normalcy are dashed.\n\nAs he delves deeper into the enigmatic world of Rhyme, Aoba stumbles upon unsettling truths about the island and its inhabitants. With his memories fragmented and people mysteriously disappearing, Aoba must confront the dark secrets hidden within Platinum Jail and unravel the twisted mysteries that threaten his very existence.",
