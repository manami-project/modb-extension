    "text": "The story is set in two contrasting worlds - the magical kingdom of Skyland, and the modern city of Sorashido. When Princess Elle, the infant heir to the throne of Skyland, is kidnapped by monsters from the sinister Underg Empire, a brave young girl named Sora leaps into action. She follows the princess through a mystical portal which transports her to Sorashido. Bewildered by the strange technologies like televisions and cars, Sora teams up with a local girl named Mashiro. Together, they must adapt to this modern world and rescue the princess from her captors. With the future of Skyland at stake, Sora and Mashiro become Pretty Cure warriors and fight back against the spreading evil of the Underg Empire. Travelling between the idyllic Skyland and bustling Sorashido, the two girls embark on a thrilling fantasy adventure filled with magic and wonder. Along the way, they will discover their true strengths and what it really means to be a hero. This is the beginning of an epic battle to protect princess Elle and restore peace across both unique worlds.",
