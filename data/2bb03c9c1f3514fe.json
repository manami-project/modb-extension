  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Some time has elapsed since 10,000 players found themselves trapped within the virtual realm of Aincrad, the world's first VRMMORPG, Sword Art Online. Asuna, a skilled player who conquered the first level of the floating iron fortress, has allied herself with the formidable Kirito. Together with the cunning information broker, Argo, they strive to ascend to the highest level and escape this deadly game.\n\nThe most prominent factions, the Aincrad Liberation Force and the Divine Dragon Alliance, have been cooperating to reach the top, but discord brews between them. A shadowy figure manipulates these guilds from behind the scenes, inciting conflict and threatening the unity of the players. Amidst this turmoil, Asuna and Kirito face a perilous battle that could seal their fate.\n\nAs they progress through the game, the unlikely pair encounters both breathtaking landscapes and treacherous challenges. With tensions rising between the two leading guilds, Kirito and Asuna must take drastic measures, rallying a few trusted allies for a daring mission. As they delve deeper into the game, Asuna and Misumi 'Mito' Tozawa are forced to confront their past and the near-tragedy that once drove them apart. In this game of survival, every decision carries weight, and every battle could be their last.",
