  "synopsis": {
    "text": "City of Daikoku, a futuristic metropolis where augmented reality has become an integral part of everyday life, is the new home for young Yasako Okonogi and her family. In this world, cyberglasses allow users to interact with a virtual layer over reality, complete with cyberpets and a wealth of information. But all is not well in Daikoku; strange occurrences plague the virtual world, with cyberpets vanishing and mysterious viruses lurking in the shadows.\n\nYasako's grandmother, affectionately known as Mega-baa, runs Megasia, a shop dealing in illegal tools for navigating the virtual realm. It also serves as a base for Coil, a group of young detectives dedicated to solving virtual world mysteries. When Yasako's cyberdog Densuke falls victim to a virus and gets trapped in virtual space, she finds herself drawn into Coil's world.\n\nJoining Yasako in her quest for answers is Fumie Hashimoto, a playful Coil member, and Yuuko Amasawa, a skilled hacker known as Isako. Together, they strive to uncover the truth behind the mysterious viruses, the enigmatic Illegal entities, and the colossal pink antivirus program, Satchii. As they delve deeper, they must confront the sinister forces at play and the potential cost of their discoveries.",
