    "text": "Industries whiz-kid Billy Kimura and prodigy Penny Carter join forces in a thrilling, retro-futuristic homage to 1950s sci-fi, as they battle against a formidable alien invasion threatening mankind's very existence. In 1995, the groundbreaking G-Reaction engine, developed by Kimura Industries, revolutionized technology, enabling aircraft to reach unparalleled speeds. However, the engine's maiden voyages in both a fighter jet and a high-speed train resulted in mysterious disappearances, followed by a wave of colored lights.\n\nFive years later, as the enigmatic vanishing acts remain unsolved, a menacing alien armada descends upon Earth, disabling all G-Reaction engines. With humanity's back against the wall, Billy and Penny - rivals in intellect and courage - team up with the enigmatic Captain Clayton and brilliant scientist Dr. Brest's daughter, Lotta, to combat the otherworldly menace.\n\nArmed with the newly-developed Sky Knight, a fighter plane capable of fending off the extraterrestrial onslaught, our young heroes must navigate through treacherous alien attacks, evade disintegration rays, and ultimately unravel the mystery behind the rainbow lights and the helmet worms' sinister tentacles of doom. Can they save the world from the impending invasion and secure humanity's future? Join them in this exhilarating adventure to find out!",
