    "text": "Ghibli Museum's exclusive short film, \"The Mice's Sumo Tournament,\" takes us on a whimsical journey into the heart of Japanese folklore. In the serene depths of the mountains, an elderly couple spends their days tirelessly cultivating their fields. One enchanting night, the old man stumbles upon a mysterious gathering of mice, who are in fact participating in a thrilling sumo tournament. Discovering that their very own house mice are the perennial losers, the kind-hearted couple decides to lend a helping hand.\n\nDetermined to bolster the mice's spirits and strength, the old man and his wife prepare a lavish feast of saury fish dumplings and mouthwatering grilled tofu drizzled with miso sauce. To top it all off, they lovingly craft brand new red sumo uniforms for their tiny team. With renewed vigor, the mice gear up for their next big sumo showdown. Will this thoughtful gesture be enough to turn the tides in their favor? Join the old couple as they eagerly anticipate the outcome of the mice's sumo games.",
