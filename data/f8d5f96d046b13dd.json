    "text": "In the 21st century, Tokyo lies in ruins after a massive earthquake caused by Shizuru Ozaki, a powerful and mentally unstable man. Since then, some individuals have come into possession of mysterious Caizer Stones which grant them superhuman abilities. Among them is an ordinary student named Isato Kaiza. When he receives a Caizer Stone from his classmate Kash, Isato gains the power to transform into the armored hero Gowcaizer. Together with Hellstinger, the alter-ego of Kash, Gowcaizer must face the threat of Omni-Exist - the embodiment of negative human desires manifested from Ozaki's instability. As Ozaki descends further into madness, he threatens to unleash worldwide destruction. It is up to Gowcaizer, Hellstinger and their allies to defeat Omni-Exist before Ozaki can obliterate humanity. With the fate of the planet at stake, these supernatural warriors must find a way to stop Ozaki's chaotic powers using their own Caizer abilities.",
