  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In a future where rising sea levels have drowned most of the world's landmasses, a young girl named Elfie lives with her grandfather in one of the few remaining cities. When Elfie accidentally discovers she can breathe underwater, her grandfather reveals a long-hidden secret - she belongs to an ancient race of aquatic people with mythical abilities. As Elfie explores her newfound heritage, tensions flare between the underwater civilization and the corrupt surface government looking to ruthlessly exploit the ocean's resources. Still bitter from humanity's past environmental destruction, the mythical sea people prepare to defend their domain. Caught in the middle, compassionate Elfie attempts to build bridges using love and understanding. But with political warmongers threatening the future of both land and sea, she soon finds herself drawn into an escalating conflict. Elfie must fight to unite two worlds, save her aquatic kin, and perhaps - through determination and hope - protect the Earth itself from humanity's shortsighted greed.",
