  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ragnarok is on the horizon as humanity's disregard for the environment has led to a catastrophic rise in sea levels, submerging civilizations beneath the waves. Centuries later, the remnants of mankind cling to the few remaining patches of land, including a city-island that Elfie calls home. When an underwater mishap reveals her ability to breathe submerged, Elfie learns from her grandfather that she is part of the legendary sea-people. As the city's power-hungry leaders incite war with the aquatic folk to divert attention from dwindling resources, Elfie finds herself entangled in the conflict. With love as her weapon, Elfie embarks on a mission to save the Earth and prevent another Ragnarok. Will she succeed in bridging the divide between land and sea before it's too late?",
