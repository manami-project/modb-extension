  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The Hyde System, once again under the imperial reign, welcomes back its young Earl, Jinto, accompanied by Lafiel. Aboard the modestly armed transport ship, Bokbrusue, they journey through the planar space, preparing for Jinto to assume his governance duties. However, the task is not as straightforward as it seems. The government of Jinto's home planet, Martine, remains defiant, stubbornly resisting the Empire's rule. As Jinto braces himself for a potential test of his diplomatic skills, the Empire's latest military innovation, the First Devastation Fleet, equipped with a new type of attack ship, the 'Attack Vessel', arrives in the Hyde System for a trial run. Will Jinto be able to navigate through these challenging waters and fulfill his duties as an Earl? Only time will tell.",
