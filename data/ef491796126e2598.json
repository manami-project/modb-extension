  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It is theorized that the vast majority of the human brain remains unused, harboring dormant psychic potential. This is proven true for brothers Naoto and Naoya Kirihara, who demonstrate powerful mental abilities from a young age. Fearful of their gifts, their parents abandon them to a research facility, where the two are held in isolation for fifteen years. When the facility's psychic barrier unexpectedly falls, Naoto and Naoya escape into an unfamiliar world. Seeking normalcy after years of confinement, the brothers soon find themselves embroiled in supernatural events beyond their control. As crimes involving psychic powers multiply, the siblings feel compelled to utilize their own abilities to protect innocent lives. With guidance from the clairvoyant Shouko Futami, Naoto and Naoya set out to understand the nature of their powers while working to undermine sinister plans targeting gifted individuals. Learning to accept themselves and cooperate as brothers promises to be as great a challenge as any external threat they face on their road to freedom.",
