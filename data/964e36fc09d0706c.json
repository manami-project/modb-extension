    "text": "On a remote Aegean island, the deranged genius Dr. Hell discovers ancient giant robots and decides to use them to take over the world. However, the expedition's other scientist, Dr. Kabuto, escapes to Japan where he develops Mazinger Z - a mighty robot made of Super Alloy Z - to thwart Dr. Hell's plans. Before his death, Kabuto entrusts Mazinger Z to his grandson Kouji, telling him of Dr. Hell's intentions. Seeking revenge for his grandfather's murder, Kouji masters Mazinger Z's controls with the help of the Photo-Atomic Research Institute, and launches into battle against Dr. Hell's mechanical beasts. With powerful beam weapons and signature Rocket Punch, Mazinger Z is a formidable opponent. However, Dr. Hell has his loyal servant Baron Ashura and an army of beasts at his command. The stage is set for an epic showdown between good and evil mecha on the Aegean Sea.",
