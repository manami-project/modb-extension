    "text": "Shindou Takuto, Matsukaze Tenma, and Tsurugi Kyousuke, the returning heroes of Inazuma Eleven Go Galaxy, find themselves on a new team, Shinsei Inazuma Japan, as part of the Football Frontier International Vision 2 (FFIV2) tournament. The team is a mix of familiar faces and new recruits, each with their own unique talents in fields such as boxing, mathematics, and rhythmic gymnastics. However, the catch is that only three of them, including our protagonists, have any experience playing soccer.\n\nAfter their successful battle to restore soccer in Japan, the trio now faces a new challenge: to represent their country in the World Cup and become world champions. Their new coach, Ryuusei Kuroiwa, surprises them by selecting eight players with no soccer background. As Shinsei Inazuma Japan, they must learn to work together and develop their soccer skills to compete against the best teams from around the world.\n\nThe stakes are high, and the team's mysterious selection raises questions about Kuroiwa's intentions. As they embark on this journey, Tenma and his teammates will discover that the FFIV2 tournament is just the beginning of a much larger, intergalactic adventure in Inazuma Eleven Go: Galaxy!",
