    "text": "After defeating the evil goddess Gunala, the fairies of Fairy Castle face a new crisis - the world's magical energy has been drained by evil wizards, threatening the Rainbow Flower that is the source of magic. If the flower withers, it will destroy the Fairy Castle world. The only hope lies in finding the legendary Rainbow Heart Stone, which can restore the lost magical energy and save Fairy Castle. Prince YouLe joins forces with his friends Sally, XiaoQian and two human girls, Maggie and Michelle, to travel back to the human world in search of the stone. Together, they must reunite and fight the evil once more to solve the biggest crisis ever faced in Fairy Castle's history, before the Rainbow Flower fades completely. The fate of the fairy world lies in the hands of these young heroes.",
