  "synopsis": {
    "text": "I was ordered by my revered master to leave my secluded life in the mountains and enter the secular world, joining a family as their son-in-law to fulfill my master's dying wish. Though the world sees me as incompetent, I am secretly a peerless swordsman of unrivaled skill. What matters it to me how coldly people look upon this supposed loser of a son-in-law? I care not what they think. With sword in hand I will prove my might, sweeping aside all challengers as I carve a path across the land and break through the very sky itself! Though my role may be humble, my skill knows no equal. Underestimate me at your peril!",
