    "text": "Nie Feng is born with a rare yang energy body, yet comes from humble beginnings and endures a difficult early life. Repeatedly oppressed and targeted by enemies, he eventually stands alone against the eight ruling martial arts clans. Cornered at last, he jumps from a cliff, seemingly to his death. Incredibly, Nie Feng awakens as his seventeen year old self, granted another chance at life. Despite his ordinary background in this new life, he quickly masters peerless martial arts, rapidly gaining fame and power. With his newfound skills, Nie Feng sets out to settle old scores and bring justice against those who previously wronged him. Though the path is difficult, he perseveres with newfound strength.",
