  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Things are far from ordinary for Aikawa Ayumu, who, after being resurrected as a zombie by the charming necromancer Eucliwood Hellscythe, finds himself in a whirlwind of supernatural escapades. Just when he thinks life might regain some semblance of normality, he's thrust into a world of secrets by Gaia, much to his chagrin.\n\nLiving under one roof with a hot-headed vampire ninja, Seraphim, a prodigious chainsaw-wielding masou shoujo, Haruna, and the silent Eucliwood, Ayumu's life is anything but peaceful. His after-school hours are filled with avoiding sunburn and encounters with the alcohol-loving fairy, Chris, who, despite her cute appearance, is up to no good.\n\nIn the second season, Ayumu's life takes a shocking turn when he accidentally breaks Haruna's magic chainsaw and inadvertently reveals his affinity for pretty pink dresses to his entire school. Amidst dances, curses, and maid caf√©s, Ayumu faces a formidable challenge when his drinking companion turns out to be the most powerful magical girl.\n\nTo save his friends and defeat this new threat, Ayumu must take drastic measures, including hosting a party for his own killer. With the support of his unusual harem of vampires, magical girls, and the world's most adorable necromancer, Ayumu might just make it through another day in this chaotic, supernatural world.",
