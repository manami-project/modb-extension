    "text": "Ansei's second year, 1855, in Edo's Koishigawa, two young men of contrasting personalities and backgrounds navigate the turbulent end of the Tokugawa era. Ryoan Tezuka, a descendant of the esteemed Tezuka lineage and a student of Western medicine, is a carefree spirit with a penchant for the fairer sex but an unwavering commitment to his medical pursuits. Ibutani Manjiro, a low-ranking samurai, is a skilled swordsman and a staunch advocate of traditional values, embodying the spirit of the samurai code. Despite their differences, these two men find their lives intertwined amidst the shifting cultural landscape of 19th century Japan. As Ryoan strives to bring modern medical practices to his homeland, Ibutani struggles to uphold the honor and customs of his samurai heritage. Together, they forge a unique bond as they navigate the challenges of their respective paths, leaving a lasting impact on each other and the world around them. This compelling tale is inspired by the true story of Ryoan Tezuka, the great-grandfather of the renowned manga artist Osamu Tezuka.",
