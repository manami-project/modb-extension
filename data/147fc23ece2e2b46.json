  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Gougou follows the story of an unconventional policeman who lives life at his own pace. Despite his odd name and tendency to perplex those around him, Gougou works to uphold law and order in modern-day Japan. However, his placid personality and unique approach clash with expectations for police officers, leaving his superiors and even criminals confused by his methods. As we follow Gougou's daily experiences, we see humorous situations arise from the juxtaposition between his calm demeanor and the chaotic world of crime-fighting. Though intent on doing good police work, Gougou bucks tradition and standard protocols, paving his own path. His atypical style plants him firmly as a new breed of policeman in the Heisei era. Full of witty contradictions, Gougou serves as a comedic look at what it means to be an officer of the law in contemporary times. Those looking for a police story with a twist of eccentricity may find Gougou's world captivates their interest.",
