    "text": "Heisei-era introduces a unique blend of comedy and law enforcement through the life of an unconventional policeman named Gougou. With a peculiar name that leaves people puzzled, Gougou navigates through life at his own leisurely pace, interacting with strangers and society as a whole in his distinct manner.\n\nDespite being a police officer tasked with maintaining law and order, Gougou's unconventional approach to his profession leaves not only his superiors but also civilians and criminals utterly baffled. His extraordinary calmness and composure, which seem almost excessive for a policeman, make his superiors question his methods.\n\nThis anime provides a delightful and humorous take on the daily life of a policeman, showcasing how Gougou's tranquil demeanor challenges the norms of his chosen profession. The series promises an engaging and entertaining experience, inviting viewers to witness Gougou's unorthodox approach to upholding the law.",
