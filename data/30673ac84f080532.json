    "text": "It's autumn in the countryside, and the village is celebrating its annual harvest festival. The adventurers are enjoying some well-earned down time. Priestess is occupied with her temple duties, High Elf Archer is sulking after an embarrassing incident, and Dwarf Shaman and Lizard Priest are pitching in to help with the festivities. Meanwhile, Goblin Slayer continues his relentless crusade against the goblins, though requests to deal with them have slowed to a trickle lately. And despite the lighthearted mood, a sense of unease hangs over the land - something sinister seems to be lurking just out of sight. When a trio of mysterious visitors arrives in town just before the big festival, Goblin Slayer suspects they may be connected to the recent shortage of goblin quests. Determined to get to the bottom of their sudden appearance and keep the townsfolk safe, Goblin Slayer begins investigating. But with the harvest festival fast approaching, will he uncover their true purpose in time?",
