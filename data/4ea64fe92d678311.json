  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yotsuba Kokoro, a clumsy yet compassionate fifth-grader, cherishes her belongings, believing they possess souls, a wisdom imparted by her grandmother. One day, a peculiar creature, a Cocotama, emerges from one of her colored pencils. Named Rakitama (or Luckytama), this tiny god binds Kokoro to a Contract of Secrecy, entrusting her to conceal their existence from the world. As Kokoro and Rakitama cohabit, they forge a deep bond, encountering other Cocotamas along the way. These apprentice gods, recognizable by the egg remnants they wear as underwear, strive to serve humans through mysterious magic, often learning from their own blunders while helping humans find lost items.",
