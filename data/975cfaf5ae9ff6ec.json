    "text": "Christmas trees, obstacle courses, and rock climbing aren't typical activities for an aspiring bento shop owner, but for Hoshimiya Ichigo, they're just part of her new life at Starlight Academy. Once an ordinary middle school student with dreams of taking over her mother's bento shop, Ichigo's world takes a dramatic turn when her best friend, Aoi, introduces her to the world of idols. Inspired by the dazzling performances of top idol Mizuki Kanzaki, Ichigo decides to follow Aoi's lead and apply to Starlight Academy, a prestigious school known for grooming the next generation of idols. As she navigates the challenges and triumphs of this new world, Ichigo meets a diverse group of rivals, learns the skills needed to shine on stage, and takes part in numerous auditions using her Aikatsu! card. With each new adventure, Ichigo discovers that the path to becoming an idol is filled with laughter, friendships, and heartbreaks, but the chance to light up the lives of others makes it all worth it. Will Ichigo have what it takes to realize her new dream and become an idol? Only time will tell in the vibrant world of Aikatsu!",
