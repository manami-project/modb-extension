  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kanna is a young priestess with mystical wings who has been kept isolated in a temple due to a curse that causes her to die and be reborn whenever she gets too close to someone. After developing feelings for her bodyguard Ryuya, Kanna decides to escape the temple with Ryuya and her confidant Uraha, unwilling to leave her friends behind by moving to a different shrine. Knowing that pursuers seek to bring them back, the trio embarks on a journey to find Kanna's mother, who she has been separated from for many years and longs to see again. Along the way, they explore the outside world beyond Kanna's confined palace life, serving as a temporary distraction from their tense situation. Over a thousand years ago, a legend foretold the story of priestesses like Kanna who possess these mystical and feared powers. With Ryuya and Uraha's help, Kanna hopes to avoid her foretold extinction on this journey to finally reunite with her mother.",
