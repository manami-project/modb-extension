  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Ryan, a German Shepherd, and his 12-year-old companion, Ayaka, find themselves in an extraordinary situation when a seemingly ordinary walk turns into a journey back in time. As a thunderstorm looms, they seek shelter in a nearby telephone booth. But the storm brings more than just rain; a bolt of lightning catapults them to March 7th, 1945, in the heart of Tokyo.\n\nAyaka, who once dismissed her grandmother's World War II stories, now finds herself living through one of history's darkest chapters. As she navigates an unfamiliar and war-torn city, she grapples with the stark contrast to her comfortable modern life.\n\nWith the impending firebombing of Tokyo looming, Ayaka must summon courage and resilience beyond her years. Stranded in the past and separated from her loved ones, she embarks on a quest for survival. All the while, she clings to hope, determined to find a way back home. This is the tale of \"Futatsu no Kurumi,\" a testament to the strength of the human spirit amidst the chaos of war.",
