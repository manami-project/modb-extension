  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Once an exemplary student at the pinnacle of angel academia, Gabriel White Tenma finds herself in a downward spiral after being sent to Earth to learn about human life. Instead of fulfilling her divine purpose of spreading joy and enlightenment, she becomes ensnared by the allure of video games and earthly pleasures, transforming into a reclusive \"Fallen Angel.\"\n\nGabriel's newfound obsession with gaming renders her a self-proclaimed \"sloppy angel,\" neglecting her duties and indulging in a life of leisure. Her apathetic demeanor and reluctance to change frustrate her demon friend, Vignette April Tsukinose, who she befriended during her initial days on Earth.\n\nAs they navigate their unconventional lives on Earth, they cross paths with two peculiar characters: Raphiel Ainsworth Shiraha, a sadistic classmate and fellow angel, and Satanichia McDowell Kurumizawa, an accident-prone demon aspiring to rule the Underworld. Together, these four friends embark on a chaotic and comedic journey, challenging the very essence of what it means to be an angel or a demon.",
