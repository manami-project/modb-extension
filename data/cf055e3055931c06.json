  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's a peculiar day-to-day life for an unusual family residing in a house, accompanied by their dog and overshadowed by a colossal pig lounging just outside. This unconventional family, comprised of a father, mother, grandmother, and six indistinguishable children, each possess their own quirks, from the father's penchant for slumbering beneath a blanket of cold cuts to the children's mischievous antics involving their mother's lipstick and the rooftop. The presence of the enormous pig is acknowledged by all, yet its thoughts and intentions remain an enigma, reflecting the family's own misunderstandings of each other. This intriguing narrative, a 2010 graduate project from Tokyo University of the Arts, invites viewers to reconsider their perceptions of typical family dynamics.",
