  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In an alternate version of Earth in the 1940s, an alien force called the Neuroi invades the planet, causing massive destruction. Humanity struggles to fight back, as conventional weapons are useless against the Neuroi's armored bodies. A scientist develops a powerful new technology called the Striker Unit which harnesses the innate magical ability of young women and transforms them into a military force known as the Strike Witches. Equipped with Striker Units, the Strike Witches are able to fly and channel their magic into weapons to combat the Neuroi. The story follows a group of girls from around the world with magical powers who join the 501st Joint Fighter Wing, an elite Strike Witches military unit on the frontlines battling the Neuroi. Among them is the daughter of the scientist who invented Striker Units, struggling to master her own powers and potentially carry on her father's legacy. Together, the 501st Strike Witches utilize their courage, camaraderie and advanced Striker Units to turn the tide against the mysterious alien invaders. Their efforts are key to protecting humanity in its darkest hour.",
