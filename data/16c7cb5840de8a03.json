    "text": "Green Leaves Entertainment, a small talent agency in Sendai, Japan, faces bankruptcy as their last client quits. President Tange hatches a plan to save the company by producing an all-girl idol singing group. With this risky idea approved, talent manager Matsuda scrambles to recruit new talent, even amateur girls with little experience. He finds a fired singer, a 13-year-old, and a maid from a cafe to form a motley crew of trainees. Though lacking in fame and fortune, the newly formed group called \"Wake Up, Girls!\" practices tirelessly to try to make it big in the music industry. Despite the odds against them as industry unknowns, their youthful energy and dedication just may be enough to wake up all of Japan to their budding musical talents.",
