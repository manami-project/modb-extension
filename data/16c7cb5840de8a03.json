    "text": "Good bye magicians, photo idols, and fortune-tellers; hello idol singers! Green Leaves Entertainment, a struggling talent agency in Sendai, is on the brink of collapse after its last client quits. In a desperate attempt to revive the company, the audacious president Tange conceives a plan to form an idol group. Tasked with scouting for fresh talent, the reluctant manager Matsuda embarks on a challenging journey to find suitable girls who aren't already signed to Japan's music industry. From a maid caf√© to a former lead singer who's been fired, Matsuda assembles an eclectic mix of aspiring idols, including a young 13-year-old girl. As this unconventional group comes together under Matsuda's guidance, they strive to make a name for themselves in the competitive world of idol music. Will their hard work and determination pay off, or will they remain in the shadows of the industry? Join WAKE UP, GIRLS! on their inspiring journey to stardom.",
