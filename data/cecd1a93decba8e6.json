  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Masahi Nishioka, a sociable and expressive editor, crosses paths with Mitsuya Majime, a reserved salesman with a deep love for words, at Genbu Publishing. As the dictionary editorial department prepares for the retirement of its veteran editor, Kouhei Araki, the search for a successor begins. The department, known for consuming resources like a 'money-eating insect,' requires someone with immense patience, dedication, and a passion for words to complete their latest project: a new dictionary called The Great Passage.\n\nDespite Majime's poor social skills and inability to read the room, his enthusiasm for words and careful personality make him an ideal candidate for the position. As he joins the team, Majime finds himself questioning his abilities and whether he will fit in with his new coworkers. However, alongside the charismatic Nishioka, the two work together to compile the medium-sized Japanese dictionary.\n\nFollow the journey of these 'awkward humans' as they navigate the vast sea of words, finding common ground and forming bonds through their shared dedication to The Great Passage.",
