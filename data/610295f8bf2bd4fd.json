  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Japan's youth rebelled in 2014, leading to Shibuya's secession and transformation into an independent nation. Amidst the chaos, the city's young inhabitants find themselves ensnared in a web of pipelines that supply essentials like electricity, water, and food. These pipelines crisscross the sky, creating a cobweb-like structure that confines the youth like insects.\n\nIn this tumultuous city, a brutal game known as Pray prevails. Players, called Prayers, convert music into electric signals and inject them into their opponents' brains, causing mental and physical destruction. Victory in these musical battles earns them money.\n\nTasuku, a Prayer, encounters an amnesiac girl, Shōko, and takes her under his wing. Unbeknownst to him, Shōko possesses a powerful voice that excels in Pray. As they navigate the treacherous world of Pray, whispers circulate that when all of Shibuya sings together, the city will rejoin Japan through a rainbow. However, Shōko's mysterious abilities hold the potential for both salvation and destruction. Initially planned as a 4-episode OVA, the series was canceled after 2 episodes.",
