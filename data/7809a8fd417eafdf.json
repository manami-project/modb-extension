    "text": "Special operations squad, Levi Squad, is formed with Eren, Historia, and their comrades from the 104th, tasked with the protection of the two valuable assets. Eren's newly discovered Titan hardening power and Historia's knowledge make them crucial for the Survey Corps' mission to reclaim Wall Maria. However, the danger lies not only beyond the walls but also within them, as the military police and government factions seek to capture Eren and Historia for their own mysterious purposes.\n\nAs Eren struggles to master his Titan abilities, the squad finds themselves in a race against time to uncover the secrets behind the Titans and the walls. A brutal murder of a priest connected to the conspiracy forces the squad to flee and seek refuge, while a figure from Levi's past emerges to thwart their plans.\n\nWith the threat of Titans looming and human enemies closing in, the squad must navigate political intrigue, protect their comrades, and uncover the truth. The survival of humanity rests on their shoulders as they face their greatest challenges yet, fighting against both monstrous Titans and cunning human adversaries.",
