    "text": "Galvatron's defeat in his quest for the powerful Angorumoa energy may have saved the universe, but the battle is far from over. In the Japanese television series \"Beast Wars Neo,\" a new conflict arises as the Destrons, led by Magmatron, embark on a relentless pursuit of the scattered Angolmois energy capsules. The Cybertron elders, in response, appoint Big Convoy to lead a team of courageous Maximals to thwart the Destrons' sinister plans.\n\nHowever, unbeknownst to both parties, a third force is manipulating the conflict from the shadows. The agents of Unicron seek the Angorumoa energy to revive their fallen master, adding a dangerous twist to the ongoing struggle between the Maximals and Predacons. As the battle escalates and the stakes grow higher, the fate of the universe hangs in the balance. Will the Maximals be able to outmaneuver both the Predacons and the agents of Unicron, or will this new war bring about the end of the Autobots? Join Big Convoy and his team in \"Beast Wars Neo\" to find out!",
