Refusing to let this setback define him, Goro resolves to return to professional baseball in Japan, this time as a fielder. As he strives to reclaim his place in the sport, his family grapples with his unwavering dedication, particularly his eldest daughter, Izumi, who yearns for a deeper connection with her father. Goro, driven by the desire to pass on his love for baseball to his children, faces the challenge of balancing his ambition with his role as a father. Will Goro's determination lead him to triumph once more, or will it cost him the love and respect of his family?",
