    "text": "The Straw Hat Pirates find themselves in a whirlwind of adventure in this extended version of the eighth \"One Piece\" feature film, aired prime time on Fuji TV with an additional 15 minutes of content. Before the events unfold in Alabastia, the new scenes take viewers back to the Whisky Peak Arc, marking the initial encounter between the Straw Hat Pirates and Vivi.\n\nOriginally released as a prologue to the movie, this new cut was presented as part of 'Premium Saturday'. The Straw Hat crew, having narrowly evaded the relentless bounty hunters of Whisky Peak, find themselves in the crosshairs of a menacing syndicate known as Baroque Works. However, their concerns escalate as they take on the responsibility of safeguarding a person of significant importance, lured by the promise of immense wealth.",
