  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The \"One Piece\" anime film was extended by 15 minutes for its primetime broadcast on Fuji TV. The new scenes depict the events from the Whisky Peak story arc in the TV series, which shows the initial encounter between the protagonist pirate crew, the Strawhats, and Vivi. This meeting occurs before the events that later transpire in Alabastia. As a prologue to the film, these additional scenes showcase the Strawhats' run-in with the bounty hunters of Whisky Peak. Soon after escaping, they catch the attention of the villainous Baroque Works crime organization. However, the Strawhats have more pressing issues to deal with - they've promised to safeguard a mysterious VIP in exchange for a massive reward. This introductory arc provides crucial backstory, setting up relationships and storylines that drive the action of the movie. By witnessing the origins of the Strawhats' pact to protect Vivi, viewers are given context to better understand the high stakes and motivations at play. The added scenes also allow audiences to see more of the core \"One Piece\" pirates' personalities and fighting styles before they dive into their most dangerous mission yet.",
