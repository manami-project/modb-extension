  "synopsis": {
    "text": "This sci-fi anime romance is set at the end of the 21st century when humans have begun expanding into space. The story follows a close group of childhood friends - two young men, Prokion and Subaru, and a young woman, Mira. As adults, Mira marries Prokion, leaving Subaru heartbroken. Shortly after their marriage, while still on their honeymoon, Prokion is called to investigate a mysterious spaceship that has arrived at the spaceport. Tragically, he contracts a fatal cosmic disease from the ship. With Prokion dead and Mira potentially infected as well, the doctors freeze Mira cryogenically to buy time. The disease will kill her in six hours unless a cure can be found. Determined to save his only love, Subaru launches into space alone to try to locate the origin of the disease and save Mira. This sci-fi romance emphasizes themes about the power of love to push humans to sacrifice and overcome, as well as the message that only love can ultimately save humankind. The story utilizes an omnibus structure, following the friends across various stages of life, similar to works like Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles.",
