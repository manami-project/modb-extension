    "text": "These three African animals—a lion, a toucan, and a lizard—are not roaming the savanna, but navigating the concrete jungle of corporate Japan. Welcome to the absurd and hilarious world of Africa Salaryman, where our wild protagonists must adapt to the office grind and the peculiarities of capitalist society. The lion, a respected senior, grapples with his fading eyesight and the misconceptions of being the \"King of the Jungle,\" while the lizard, a clumsy but well-meaning employee, tries to keep the peace. Meanwhile, the mischievous toucan, with a penchant for pranks and flirtation, wreaks havoc in the office, leaving no ham sandwich or lizard tail safe. Amidst the chaos, they strive to maintain their jobs and sanity, offering a comedic and unique take on the trials and tribulations of office life.",
