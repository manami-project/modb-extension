Eager to claim the championship title, they must first face off against rivals old and new who won't hesitate to use dirty tactics. Seishun's first major test is against the Higa Middle School team from Okinawa, known for their cutthroat style. After witnessing Higa's unsportsmanlike conduct against another team, Seishun is determined to defeat them with skill and ethics. Next up is a rematch with the formidable Hyoutei Academy, back with a vengeance after their upset loss to Seishun at the Kanto Regionals. With opponents bringing unique tennis philosophies and personal grudges, the National Tournament promises to challenge Seishun's players like never before. Ryouma and teammates enter with hopes high, ready to showcase their growth since qualifying and prove themselves as the best middle school tennis team in Japan. Through hard work and passion for the game, they aim to overcome all odds and emerge victorious with the championship title.",
