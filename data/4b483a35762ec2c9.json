  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In the year 2047, mankind discovered a rare metal ore called 'Gaimetal' 50,000 meters underground. This ore possessed huge amounts of energy, so mining operations began around the world. However, in 2055, metallic creatures called 'Gaist', whose bodies were encrusted with Gaimetal, emerged and started attacking humans. In response, mankind formed an organization called GCG (Gaist Crusher Garrison) in 2064 to battle the Gaist threat. The GCG utilizes specially trained warriors called Gaist Crushers, who don powered armor called 'Gaist Gear' to combat the Gaist. Four notable Gaist Crushers are Rekka, Hayato, Kurama, and Siren. They battle against over 100 varieties of Gaist creatures. However, they also face opposition from a mysterious organization called 'Erasers'. Overall, this anime tells the story of mankind's discovery of a powerful new energy source, and the ensuing conflict with metallic creatures intent on attacking humanity. Viewers follow a team of elite warriors as they fight to protect the world from this dangerous new threat. The story promises plenty of action along with themes of humanity's relationship with technology and nature.",
