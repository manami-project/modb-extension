    "text": "In the realm of the popular trading card game, WIXOSS, a select few girls stumble upon an extraordinary secret - the existence of LRIG cards. These rare cards possess unique qualities, harboring their own will and consciousness. Once a girl discovers her LRIG card, she becomes a 'Selector,' granted access to a hidden dimension where battles are waged with high stakes.\n\nMeet Ruuko Kominato, a newcomer in town struggling to form connections. Hoping to help her make friends, Ruuko's brother gifts her a WIXOSS deck, inadvertently introducing her to the enigmatic world of LRIGs. Upon discovering the living avatar on her card, Ruuko is thrust into a series of battles against fellow Selectors, each with their own desires and ambitions.\n\nThe rules are both alluring and treacherous: triumph in combat and earn the chance to have your heart's deepest wish granted. However, suffer defeat three times, and face the dire consequences of a dark curse. As Ruuko navigates this perilous game, she must decipher the true intentions behind WIXOSS and determine what truly matters to her before her time runs out. In this deceptive world of hope, desire, and greed, Ruuko's journey for self-discovery and friendship begins.",
