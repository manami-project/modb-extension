    "text": "As a renowned high school detective, Shinichi Kudo's skills rival those of Sherlock Holmes. But when he stumbles upon a clandestine operation, the men in black retaliate by administering an experimental drug meant to silence him forever. Instead, the drug shrinks him to the size of a seven-year-old. To safeguard his loved ones, Shinichi adopts a new identity: Conan Edogawa. Living with his childhood friend Ran and her bumbling detective father, Conan covertly solves cases to find the nefarious organization that altered his life. Amidst a web of mysteries and perilous threats, Conan's quest for justice and a cure begins.",
