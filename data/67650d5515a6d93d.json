    "text": "And so, the stage is set in the country of East Doroa, home to the coveted treasure known as the Little Comet. Amidst escalating tensions between East and West Doroa following the tragic assassination of the renowned singer Queen Malta, the legendary thief Lupin III and his partner Jigen Daisuke find themselves undeterred in their pursuit of the precious gemstone.\n\nAs they embark on their daring heist, they find themselves in the crosshairs of a formidable sniper, Yael Okuzaki. Known for his chilling practice of crafting tombstones for his targets before executing them, Yael's reputation precedes him - no one has ever survived after he's made a grave for them.\n\nIn a bizarre twist, Jigen discovers his own gravestone during a visit to the cemetery, a clear message from Yael. As the plot thickens, it becomes evident that Yael's interest lies solely in Jigen, leaving Lupin unscathed. Why is Yael targeting Jigen, and who will emerge victorious from this deadly game of cat and mouse?\n\nWith the stakes higher than ever, Lupin and Jigen must navigate the complexities of political strife, a mysterious assassin, and their own personal vendettas in this thrilling continuation of the 2012 'Lupin III: The Woman Called Fujiko Mine' television anime series.",
