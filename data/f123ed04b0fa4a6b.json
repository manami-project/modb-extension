As Mewtwo seeks to prove his superiority over both humans and Pokémon, a colossal battle between the original and cloned Pokémon ensues.\n\nWith the future of the Pokémon world hanging in the balance, can Ash, his friends, and the original Mew quell Mewtwo's thirst for vengeance and help him find a new purpose in life?
