  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Balbagoa Tragedy, a calamitous event that shook the continent of Kunaaan, left the land in despair as the evil dragon Daganzord continued his reign of terror, unchallenged. The delicate balance of power between the Holy Kingdom of Amoria, the Kingdom of Ishilfen, and the Kingdom of Vanrodis hangs by a thread, with war lurking around the corner.\n\nHiiro, a young warrior, was only a child when his parents, Bairo and Kismitete, attempted to seal Daganzord with a group of wizards. Their failure left Hiiro orphaned, but he was saved by the skilled swordsman, Gill. With vengeance burning in his heart, Hiiro trained under Gill's watchful eye, honing his sword skills to one day slay the dragon that took his parents' lives.\n\nOn his 16th birthday, Hiiro embarks on a perilous journey, accompanied by the reluctant Gill. Along the way, they meet a diverse group of individuals who join their cause, each with their own motivations. As the group grows stronger, so does Hiiro's determination to put an end to Daganzord's destruction.\n\nBut the question remains â€“ will Hiiro's resolve be enough to overcome the destiny he has chosen, or will he suffer the same fate as his parents before him? Only time will tell, as the battle against the evil dragon looms ever closer.",
