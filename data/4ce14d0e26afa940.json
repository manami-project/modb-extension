    "text": "Meet Speckles, a young and spirited Tarbosaurus, who once lived a joyful and carefree life in the lush forests of what is now known as Jeonnam Yeosu, Korea, alongside his loving family. As he embarks on his first hunting lesson, his world is suddenly shattered by the vicious attack of One-Eye, a menacing Tyrannosaur seeking a new territory. The brutal assault leaves Speckles alone and vulnerable, with his family cruelly torn away from him.\n\nIn the vast and unforgiving wilderness, Speckles crosses paths with Blue Eyes, another solitary Tarbosaur, who becomes his steadfast companion and, eventually, the mother of his own children. Together, they form a new family, braving the harsh realities of the prehistoric world.\n\nBut destiny has more in store for Speckles, as his past comes back to haunt him. The formidable One-Eye, who brought so much pain and suffering to his life, resurfaces, forcing Speckles to confront his deepest fears and seek vengeance. As he faces the challenges of survival, Speckles discovers the true meaning of resilience, hope, and the unbreakable bond of family.",
