  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Jay lived peacefully with his sister Tenna and fellow Butler Hayakawa, until Tenna mysteriously vanished and Jay was sent 100 years into the future. There, Jay assumes the identity of Koma Jinguji and becomes the student council president at Koyomi Academy, which now stands where his mansion once did. As Jinguji investigates clues about his past, he is joined by Hayakawa, who works at a popular cafe making ornate latte art. Though initially confused by the time jump, the two Butlers grow close as they unravel the supernatural events that tore their lives apart. Jinguji uses his intelligence and charm to become a campus leader, admired by female students, while Hayakawa's gentle warmth also makes him popular. Together, they battle otherworldly enemies from their past in order to save loved ones in the present and future. Along the way, their courage and loyalty to each other is tested by dangerous missions and lighthearted antics at the academy. The two Butlers share a long history and are fated to face off against a powerful nemesis. Their devotion to the academy, the cafe, and most importantly, to each other, gives them strength as they draw ever closer to the truth.",
