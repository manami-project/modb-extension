  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows the daily life of a young girl named Prushka who lives with her father Bondrewd at a research station called the \"Ido Front\" on the fifth layer of the Abyss. Under normal circumstances, Prushka would have had a regular childhood with her father. This lighthearted short bonus episode offers a glimpse into humorous snippets of that imaginary normal life, showing the father-daughter bond between Prushka and Bondrewd. Originally released as an extra feature titled \"Made in Abyss: Together with Papa\" with the first Blu-ray/DVD volume of the \"Made in Abyss: The Golden City of the Scorching Sun\" series, this mini anime aims to provide some comedic relief and charming moments between the characters. While keeping the harsh reality of the Abyss setting ever-present, this short explores an endearing \"what if\" scenario focusing on the characters' daily routine at the research station.",
