  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Hart, Lola, Janet, Helen, Caroline, and Margaret, six women with diverse backgrounds, embark on a train journey to Sunshine Hill in the early 1800s. As they traverse the Old West, their journey takes an unexpected turn when their steam-train is ambushed by ruthless bandits. While the men are separated and moved to the last carriage, the women find themselves in the midst of a fierce shootout.\n\nAgainst all odds, the women prove their mettle and defeat the bandits. However, their victory comes at a cost: the men's carriage detaches, leaving the six women to navigate the rest of their journey alone. Margaret, an aspiring sheriff with little experience, takes the lead. Alongside a fellow passenger named Spencer, the women form a resilient team, determined to guide the train to safety and confront any obstacles that come their way.\n\nIn a world dominated by cowboys and soldiers, these six women prove that courage and determination know no gender. Their thrilling adventure unfolds in Early Reins, a tale that challenges conventions and showcases the power of unity and resilience.",
