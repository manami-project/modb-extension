    "text": "The anime \"Boku no Hero Academia: All Might - Rising The Animation\" delves into the backstory of All Might on his journey to becoming the number one hero. Initially released as bonus content on the Blu-ray version of \"My Hero Academia: Two Heroes,\" this prequel story follows a young All Might as he inherits the special power \"One for All,\" which allows him to stockpile quirks and become the Symbol of Peace. Through flashbacks, we witness All Might's struggles in mastering this ability under his mentor's guidance. Despite setbacks, All Might perseveres with unwavering heroic spirit. We ultimately see the origins of how this scrawny quirkless boy transforms into the world's greatest hero. The second episode serves as an epilogue, reflecting on the events and characters of \"My Hero Academia: Two Heroes\" while setting up future plot threads. Together, these shorts enrich the My Hero Academia universe by spotlighting All Might's formative journey toward the pinnacle of heroism.",
