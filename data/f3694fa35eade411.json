    "text": "Island's Last Hurrah: A Tale of Friendship and Farewells\n\nNestled just off the mainland, South Sakoujima Island boasts picturesque slopes and a quaint town, home to Temuzigawa Gakuen, the school that Hoshino Wataru attends. Once a thriving hub for a renowned aviation company, the island now faces an imminent shutdown, forcing the residents to evacuate within a year. As the student body dwindles, only Wataru and a few girls remain in their refurbished dormitory.\n\nOne day, Wataru discovers a mysterious girl, Rinna Sawaki, sleeping in his room, clad only in her underwear. After a feisty introduction, Rinna reveals herself as a new transfer student and Wataru's future roommate. However, Rinna is reluctant to form bonds with Wataru and the others, knowing the pain of their inevitable separation.\n\nDetermined to make the most of their remaining time together, Wataru embarks on a heartwarming journey to win over Rinna and his fellow dormmates. As the days pass, Wataru delves deeper into the lives of these girls, leaving a lasting impact on their hearts.\n\nWith the clock ticking down on their time together, can Wataru and his friends create unforgettable memories and convince Rinna of the value of cherishing the friendships they've made?
