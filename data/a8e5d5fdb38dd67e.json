    "text": "Her alded by a chilling tragedy that struck a housing complex in Machida five years ago, the lives of many were forever altered. The horrifying incident, known as the Machida Massacre, claimed the lives of 382 individuals, leaving behind a mere twelve survivors and a mysterious, ever-expanding chasm. One survivor, Shindou Ranmaru, is driven by a thirst for vengeance for his slain parents.\n\nHaunted by recurring nightmares featuring a sword-wielding, half-dressed woman and monstrous creatures, Ranmaru's determination leads him to join the Special Mobile Investigation Force, TOKKI. On his inaugural day, he encounters the very woman from his dreams, who is part of an elite and clandestine division within TOKKI, known as TOKKO. Together, they delve into the enigmatic events surrounding the Machida Massacre.\n\nAs they strive to unravel the truth, bizarre occurrences unfold across Japan, with gaping voids appearing and unleashing inexplicable creatures. Could these phenomena be interconnected with the mass murder that took place in Machida? With a resolve to avenge his parents and uncover the truth, Ranmaru must confront these otherworldly entities and unlock the secrets of his past.",
