    "text": "Tang Ying is the sole survivor after her hometown of Baicheng is attacked by the enemy kingdom of Beiyi. Her father, the guard of Baicheng, sacrificed his life trying to defend the town, but is later falsely accused of collaborating with the enemy. Seeking to clear her father's name and get justice, Tang Ying travels to the capital of the Daqi Kingdom. Upon arriving, Tang Ying discovers there is more to the attack than meets the eye. There seems to be a connection between Prince Yuan Lang, who has been a hostage of Beiyi for years, and the invasion. Additionally, Tang Ying keeps encountering a mysterious woman who bears an uncanny resemblance to herself. As Tang Ying investigates further, she begins uncovering strange, familiar memories that leave her questioning her own identity. It appears there are secrets about her past that even she is unaware of. With more puzzles than answers, Tang Ying resolves to get to the bottom of the mysteries surrounding the attack on her hometown no matter the cost. Will she be able to clear her father's name? Who is the prince that shares a history with Beiyi? And what is the explanation for Tang Ying's inexplicable memories?",
