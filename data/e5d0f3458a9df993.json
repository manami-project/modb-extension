  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Precisely in the heart of the Holy Kingdom of Dinez, in the bustling city of Terene, four disillusioned adventurers cross paths in a run-down tavern. Nick, a seasoned Light Warrior, finds himself at rock bottom after being unjustly accused of embezzlement by his trusted mentor and abandoned by his lover. As he drowns his sorrows in lukewarm beer, he stumbles upon three kindred spirits: Tiana, a mage; Zem, a cleric; and Curran, a half-dragon. Each of them carries their own scars of betrayal, distrust, and a shared lack of funds.\n\nIn a serendipitous twist of fate, the four adventurers decide to join forces to earn money and pursue their respective hobbies. As they navigate through the labyrinthine city filled with adventurers, merchants, and nobles, they embark on a journey to regain their lost faith in humanity. Little do they know that their shared distrust and mutual understanding will one day save the world from an unimaginable threat.\n\nWitness the thrilling tale of the 'Survivors,' as they rank up and challenge the perils of the world with their newfound camaraderie.",
