    "text": "Japanese spinoff series Queen's Blade: Rebellion unfolds in a world where power has corrupted the once noble Queen Claudette, leading to a reign of oppression and heretical persecution. A new generation of warriors, led by the wandering knight Annelotte, rises to challenge the queen's tyranny and restore justice. Despite the queen's formidable Amazonian ranks and her power of writ and assassins, the daring damsels' incredible wits and assets might just expose unexpected weaknesses in the queen's support. Based on the combat picture book games, the Rebellion storyline is set four years after the original Queen's Blade storyline and has already inspired two prologue original video anime DVDs. Join Annelotte and her growing band of warriors as they risk everything to set right what has gone wrong in this thrilling and engaging series.",
