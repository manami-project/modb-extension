    "text": "After Nami unexpectedly betrays the Straw Hat pirates by stealing their ship the Going Merry, Luffy and some of his crew including Zoro, Usopp, and Sanji set out after her, determined to get answers. Their pursuit leads them to Cocoyasi Village, Nami's hometown that is under the ruthless control of Arlong, an infamous fish-man pirate. Upon arriving in Cocoyasi, the Straw Hats attempt to convince Nami to return, but she refuses. As tensions rise, Nami's mysterious past begins to unravel, revealing the truth behind her association with Arlong. It turns out she had struck a deal to buy back her village from the tyrannical rule of the fish-men pirates, though the price of doing so has taken a tremendous personal toll. With Nami's true motivations brought to light, Luffy and his crew must decide whether to stand by their navigator or abandon her to her accord with the merciless Arlong. As the Straw Hats clash with the fish-men, the battle ahead will determine not just the fate of Cocoyasi Village but also the future of their crew.",
