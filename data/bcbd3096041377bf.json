  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Yuta, a young boy still grappling with the loss of his father in a tragic car accident, finds himself on a nostalgic journey to a deserted dam nestled deep within the mountains. It was here that he and his father shared cherished memories, collecting rhinoceros beetles and enjoying the serenity of nature. Amidst a sudden thunderstorm, Yuta slips and loses consciousness, only to awaken in an unfamiliar village and era.\n\nIn a twist of fate, Yuta has been transported 30 years into the past, to a time before the dam was constructed, and the village he now finds himself in was submerged beneath its waters. Unbeknownst to him, his act of kindness towards an enigmatic old man at the dam has led to this unexpected journey back in time.\n\nAs Yuta navigates through this 'other' summer vacation, he encounters Saeko, a captivating girl with a profound love for fireflies. Unaware of the reason behind his time-travel, Yuta embarks on an extraordinary adventure in a village destined to be lost beneath the dam's waters. As he rediscovers the joy of summer, Yuta finds himself with a chance to reclaim something he thought he had lost forever.",
