    "text": "One ambitious artist, two timelines, and a shared passion for bishoujo games. In 1992, Meiko Uehara, a college student and gifted artist, stumbles upon a part-time job at a computer store that secretly develops erotic bishoujo games. When the graphic designer quits, Meiko is thrust into the world of R-18 illustrations, armed with only her talent and a 16-bit PC. Fast forward to 2023, Konoha Akisato, another talented illustrator, finds herself stuck in a dead-end job at Blue Bell, a struggling bishoujo game company that churns out low-quality games. Dreaming of creating beautiful heroines and becoming a renowned illustrator, Konoha's life takes a drastic turn when she discovers a vintage game store and is transported back to 1992, the dawn of the bishoujo game era. Joining Alcohol Soft, a small game company, Konoha must adapt to outdated technology and illustration techniques to finally realize her dreams. As Meiko and Konoha navigate their respective challenges, will they successfully create the captivating bishoujo games they've always envisioned? Only time will tell as they embark on their creative journeys.",
