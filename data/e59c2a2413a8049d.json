  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Now stepping back into the world after a year of hospitalization due to a car accident, Hiyori Nishiyama, a petite and introverted 15-year-old, finds herself facing the daunting task of adjusting to school life. Standing at just 140cm, her small stature and timid nature make her an easy target for attention, something she's not quite comfortable with. As she attempts to navigate her new environment, she crosses paths with Yuushin Hirose, a tall and outgoing classmate who becomes her unexpected ally. Despite their stark contrasts in both height and personality, Hirose's friendly demeanor gradually helps Hiyori break free from her shell, leading to a blossoming friendship and perhaps, something more. As they sit side by side in class, Hiyori's journey of self-discovery and social growth unfolds, marking the beginning of a heartwarming tale of love, friendship, and courage.",
