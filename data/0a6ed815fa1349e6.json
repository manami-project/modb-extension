  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Serizawa Kamo, a formidable leader of the Roshigumi, stumbles upon Ryunosuke Ibuki, a young man left for dead after a vicious robbery, as he journeys to Kyoto in 1863. Despite being the son of a samurai, Ryunosuke harbors a deep disdain for them. Serizawa, however, takes him in and forces him to become his personal assistant, treating him like a mere dog.\n\nAs political turmoil grips Japan and violence escalates, the Tokugawa Shogunate dispatches the Roshigumi, a group of masterless samurai, to aid the Aizu forces in Kyoto. However, internal strife has divided the Roshigumi into two factions: one led by the ruthless Serizawa, and the other by the more honorable but less assertive Isami Kondo.\n\nAs Ryunosuke witnesses the Roshigumi's internal struggles and the stark contrast between the two leaders, he begins to question his hatred for samurai. He starts to see that there is a chance for redemption, both for himself and Japan, if only Kondo can muster the courage to challenge Serizawa's tyranny. Amidst this political unrest and samurai rivalry, the enigmatic 'Water of Life' begins to unravel its mystery, further complicating the unfolding drama.",
