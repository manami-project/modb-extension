  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After devastating earthquakes strike the Kumamoto Prefecture in 2016, college student Natsuna Keyaki loses contact with her dear online friend, Itsuki, who lives in the area. With only a sketch of the local landscape that Itsuki once sent, Natsuna travels from Tokyo to Kumamoto in hopes of finding her. Upon arriving, Natsuna gets lost in the rural, disaster-stricken prefecture. She encounters a kindly policeman and a spirited local middle school girl named Izumi Chiba, who along with her hospitable family, provides Natsuna with shelter and helps guide her search. As Natsuna follows every lead while being welcomed by the community along the way, she moves closer to uncovering what happened to Itsuki after the earthquakes. Through this experience, the compassion of the locals ignites a passion within Natsuna, sparking a heartfelt coming-of-age journey.",
