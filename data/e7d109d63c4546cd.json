    "text": "Li Shi was born under mysterious circumstances, becoming the host of a powerful remnant soul that drew the attention of multiple sects who hunted him in his infancy. To protect their son, his parents sent him away to be raised in secret by Yuan Chenyang in the fishing village of Linhai. Years later as a teenager, Li Shi decides to reenter the world of cultivation, hoping to uncover clues about his missing parents and the sects that once threatened him. However, upon returning, he stumbles upon a demonic plot by the monstrous Bai Xiang, who schemes to turn the people of Linhai into blood sacrifices. With the help of the enigmatic Ying Gou, Li Shi races to foil Bai Xiang's evil formation and save the residents of Linhai from a gruesome fate. Outnumbered but empowered by his mystical soldier's soul, Li Shi confronts threats both old and new in this brewing storm that could engulf all the sects of the mountains and seas.",
