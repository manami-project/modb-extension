Kouhei Morioka, an aspiring photographer with a knack for capturing the paranormal on film, stumbles upon a mysterious girl named Hazuki while exploring an old German castle. Hazuki, a vampire princess trapped within the castle's walls, attempts to turn Kouhei into her servant by biting him, but her powers have no effect on him. Instead, Kouhei inadvertently helps Hazuki escape the castle and return to Japan in search of her long-lost mother.\n\nUpon arriving in Japan, Hazuki seeks refuge with Kouhei and his grandfather, who reluctantly agree to take her in. Despite their initial reservations, Kouhei and Hazuki form a unique bond as they embark on a journey to find Hazuki's mother and evade the other vampires who are hot on their trail. Along the way, they encounter a host of supernatural creatures and learn valuable lessons about friendship, family, and what it truly means to be human. With its charming blend of gothic horror and slice-of-life comedy, Tsukuyomi: Moonphase is a must-watch for fans of the supernatural and the heartwarming.",
