  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Pop uko and Pipimi, two 14-year-old high school girls with contrasting personalities, take center stage in this surreal, four-panel manga turned anime. Popuko, small and hot-headed, is a stark contrast to the tall and tranquil Pipimi. Together, they embark on absurd adventures, their antics filled with meta humor, pop culture references, and a liberal sprinkling of profanity. From navigating video game worlds to engaging in space shootouts, these girls defy conventions and genre norms, their primary objective being to transform their manga into a real anime. Despite their crude language and outrageous behavior, their endearing friendship shines through, making for a unique and entertaining viewing experience.",
