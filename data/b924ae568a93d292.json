  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime centers around a restaurant called \"Western Cuisine Nekoya\" located in the basement of a building in Japan. Though it appears ordinary during the week, the restaurant secretly opens on Saturdays to serve customers from a parallel fantasy world. Doors connecting our world and the fantasy world allow diverse races and cultures to enter Nekoya. Patrons include mercenaries, young couples escaping angered parents, and more seeking both refuge and Nekoya's renowned dishes. The restaurant's excellent food and service even draws magical regulars. Nekoya is run by a mostly human staff: the skilled head chef Master, cheerful demon waitress Aletta, and mysterious elf Kuro. Each episode tells independent stories of Nekoya's fantastical patrons as Master's team provides top-notch hospitality and culinary adventures.",
