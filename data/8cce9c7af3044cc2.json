  "synopsis": {
    "text": "There's a young girl named Mitsuki Kouyama, with a big dream and an even bigger challenge. At just twelve years old, she aspires to become a professional singer, but a malignant tumor in her throat threatens to silence her forever. Despite the grim diagnosis, Mitsuki remains undeterred, fueled by a promise she made to her beloved Eichi, who moved to America two years ago. She hopes her music will reach him one day, as radiant as a full moon.\n\nWhen two shinigami, Takuto and Meroko, appear before her, they reveal that Mitsuki has only one year left to live. Instead of succumbing to despair, Mitsuki finds new resolve in her dreams. With the divine intervention of the shinigami, she's transformed into a healthy sixteen-year-old, giving her a chance to pursue her singing career.\n\nAs she navigates the highs and lows of the music industry, Mitsuki's journey becomes a race against time. With every note she sings, she moves closer to her dream, and to Eichi. Despite the looming shadow of her illness and the ticking clock, Mitsuki refuses to let anything stand in her way. Her story is a testament to the power of dreams, love, and the resilience of the human spirit.",
