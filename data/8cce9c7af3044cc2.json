    "text": "Twelve-year-old Mitsuki Kouyama dreams of becoming a professional singer, but her hopes are shattered when she is diagnosed with throat cancer. With only one year left to live, Mitsuki refuses surgery due to the risk of losing her voice. Then two Shinigami, Meroko and Takuto, appear and offer to transform Mitsuki into a healthy 16-year-old so she can pursue her dream. With her new identity and divine help, Mitsuki passes a singing audition and embarks on a short but meaningful career. However, she races against time to achieve stardom and reunite with her friend Eichi in America, who moved away before she could confess her feelings to him. Despite the grief of impending death, Mitsuki lives life to the fullest with unwavering determination. Full Moon Wo Sagashite tells an emotional story about following one’s dreams against all odds, the redemptive power of music, and making the most of life’s fleeting moments.",
