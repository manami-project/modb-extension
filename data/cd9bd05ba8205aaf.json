    "text": "Natsuo Maki, a paragon of grace and elegance, leads the student council at the prestigious Fujisaki Girls Academy, a school renowned for its refined young ladies. Behind closed doors, however, Maki harbors a secret passion for romance and longs to experience the thrill of love. When the spirited and athletic Riko Kurahashi stumbles upon Maki practicing kissing on a pillow, she unexpectedly finds herself drawn into Maki's world.\n\nRiko, known for her boyish charm and forthright nature, is now privy to Maki's hidden desires. Instead of exposing Maki, she agrees to help her navigate the complexities of love, leading to the formation of the \"Love Lab.\" In this secret project, the unlikely duo explores various aspects of romance, from accidental encounters to the delicate art of hand-holding.\n\nAs the Love Lab expands to include other members of the student council, each with their own distinct personalities, the group embarks on a hilarious and heartwarming journey of discovery. Through their research and real-life experiences, they learn not only about love but also about the power of friendship. Will their studies lead them to the romance they seek, or will they uncover something even more precious? Join the Love Lab to find out!",
