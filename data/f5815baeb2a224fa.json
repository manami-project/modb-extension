  "synopsis": {
    "text": "After daring to demand fair wages, a factory worker is met with the harsh reality of unemployment in a town gripped by poverty. His mother, already weakened by their dire circumstances, vanishes without a trace, leaving him to navigate a solitary existence. As the harshest winter on record descends upon the town, both the wealthy and the destitute are left to grapple with the relentless snow and ice. Amidst the despair, the former worker discovers a hidden talent for poetry, using his newfound gift to offer solace and hope to his struggling ex-colleagues. This poignant and thought-provoking short film by Kihachiro Kawamoto, inspired by a story from acclaimed novelist Kobo Abe, explores the transformative power of the poetic imagination in the face of adversity.",
