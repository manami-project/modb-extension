    "text": "Iori and Ichitaka's love story is far from straightforward, as the young man must navigate a sea of challenges to win the affection of his beloved classmate and aspiring actress. Ichitaka has admired Iori from afar, but his shyness has always held him back from expressing his true feelings. However, fate intervenes, and the two find themselves working together on their school's Freshmen Welcoming Party. Just as things seem to be taking a turn for the better, Ichitaka's childhood friend, Itsuki, arrives from the United States, stirring up a whirlwind of misunderstandings and complications. As Ichitaka grapples with staying true to his feelings amidst pranks, stalkers, and romantic meddling, he can't help but wonder if he and Iori are truly destined to be together or if fate has other plans in store. On Christmas Eve, while waiting for a double date with Iori and his friend Yasuo, Ichitaka reflects on the missed opportunities and miscommunications that have defined his pursuit of love. Will Ichitaka find the courage to confess his love, or will the obstacles prove insurmountable? Only time will tell in this heartwarming tale of love, friendship, and self-discovery.",
