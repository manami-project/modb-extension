  "synopsis": {
    "text": "While attempting to impress Pururu, a young Keroro inadvertently traps himself, Giroro, Dororo, and Pururu inside the Kero Ball, a powerful and multifunctional Keronian weapon borrowed from Giroro's brother, Garuru. The group finds themselves in a challenging pinball simulation within the ball, and the only way out is to win the maze. Meanwhile, a blue tadpole named Kururu discovers the Kero Ball and offers to free the trapped tadpoles in exchange for a plate of curry rice. However, the plate grows to an enormous size, engulfing Kururu in curry and transforming him into a 'yellow devil'. To escape their arcade-style prison and avoid a curry-induced catastrophe, the young Keronian tadpoles must overcome the bizarre and hellish obstacles within the Kero Ball.",
