  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Merlin Wolford, a legendary figure renowned for his magical prowess and heroic deeds in the kingdom of Earlshide, opts for a tranquil existence in the countryside. Here, he nurtures an orphaned baby, Shin, who is actually the reincarnation of a modern-day Japanese salaryman. Over the years, Merlin imparts his knowledge of combat and magic to Shin, who demonstrates remarkable aptitude in both fields. However, upon turning 15, it becomes evident that Merlin overlooked teaching Shin a crucial aspect of lifeâ€”common sense and social norms. To address this oversight and foster Shin's personal growth, Merlin enrolls him in the prestigious Magic Academy in the capital of Alsheid. As Shin navigates his new life at the academy, he grapples with social interactions, gains new friends, and unwittingly becomes a local celebrity. Meanwhile, the ominous rumblings of an impending war begin to surface, threatening Shin and his newfound companions.",
