  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Earth faces an imminent alien invasion from the planet Zela. Zela itself is being swallowed by a black hole, and its leader, the supercomputer Emperor Darius, seeks a new home for his people. He targets Earth for conquest, sending his generals and their armies to attack and seize control. Earth's best hope lies with an eclectic group aboard the transforming spaceship carrier Daiku Maryu. This crew includes American pilot Pete, sumo wrestler Gorrion, kickboxer Miri, and other psychics. They are joined by hotshot baseball player Sanshiro Tsuwabuki, who lost the use of his pitching arm from a Zelan attack. Fueled by revenge, Sanshiro becomes the pilot of the giant super robot Gaiking. When Zela's forces strike, Daiku Maryu launches Gaiking and its components into battle. The components reunite into the unbreakable Gaiking robot for Sanshiro to operate. Sanshiro and Daiku Maryu's crew now stand as the lone protectors of Earth against Darius' invading armies. Their courage, skills and weaponry are all that protects humanity from conquest and destruction at the hands of the desperate and ruthless invaders from planet Zela.",
