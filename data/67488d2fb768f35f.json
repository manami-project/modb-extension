  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Du Wei is reborn into a magical new world from Earth, seemingly without purpose. As the eldest yet frail son of an imperial general, Du Wei is seen as inferior and ignored by his accomplished family. He does not speak as a child, cursing his fate in this unfamiliar land full of magic and heroes. However, legend states that the prosperous Roland Empire will soon fall unless a chosen hero emerges, as foretold by its founding emperor Aragorn a millennium ago. By chance, Du Wei becomes stranded on a deserted island and bargains with a devil’s servant to gain infinite power. Now, armed with knowledge from his past life on Earth, Du Wei embarks on an epic journey to defy his family’s expectations, discover truths about this new world of magic, and seize his destiny - even if it means becoming a devil himself. Overcoming his perceived weaknesses, Du Wei quests alongside heroes and magic apprentices to challenge the gods themselves. His actions will determine if the prophecy comes true and the empire falls, or if Du Wei can rise as the prophesied hero to save it against all odds.",
