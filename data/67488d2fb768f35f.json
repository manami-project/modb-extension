    "text": "Wei Du, a silent and seemingly unremarkable child, finds himself inexplicably transported to the mystical Roland Continent, far from his original home on Earth. Despite his father's prestigious status as a Great General, Wei Du is dismissed as an ungifted and intellectually challenged heir by his family. Cursing his fate, he vows to uncover the secrets of this new world and use his past life's knowledge to shed his unwanted label, even if it means aligning himself with dark forces. As the Roland Empire's thousand-year prosperity teeters on the brink of collapse, a prophecy foretells the rise of a chosen hero to reverse its fate. When Wei Du encounters a devil's servant on a deserted island and gains unlimited power, his legendary quest to claim his rightful place as a king begins.",
