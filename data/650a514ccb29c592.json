    "text": "The story of Strike the Blood unfolds on Itogami Island, a man-made haven for mythical creatures, located 300km south of Tokyo. Kojou Akatsuki, a seemingly ordinary high school student, finds himself transformed into the Fourth Primogenitor, a legendary vampire of unparalleled power, following an unexpected encounter. As the Fourth Primogenitor, Kojou is believed to possess the strength to challenge an entire nation's military, making him a potential threat to the world.\n\nTo keep tabs on Kojou and, if necessary, neutralize him, the Lion King Organization dispatches an apprentice sword-shaman, Yukina Himeragi. Despite her inexperience, Yukina is tasked with the monumental responsibility of monitoring the world's most powerful vampire. As they navigate their unusual circumstances, Kojou and Yukina form an unlikely alliance, working together to uncover the truth behind Kojou's newfound powers and protect the city from the emerging chaos. Will they succeed in their mission, or will the Fourth Primogenitor's power prove to be too much for them to handle? Only time will tell.",
