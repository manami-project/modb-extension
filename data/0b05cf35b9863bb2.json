    "text": "Akio's obsession with street racing on Tokyo's longest and straightest highway, the Shuto Expressway, leads him to purchase a seemingly cursed Nissan Fairlady 240Z from a junkyard. Despite the car's dark history and warnings from friends, Akio becomes determined to restore the \"Devil Z\" to its former glory and claim the title of the fastest racer on the treacherous Wangan route. With traffic and heavy trucks adding to the danger, Akio's journey is filled with accidents and setbacks, but his passion for racing and desire to defeat the infamous \"BlackBird\" Porsche 964 Turbo keep him pushing forward. As he delves deeper into the world of underground street racing, Akio befriends fellow racers and mechanics, all while uncovering the secrets behind the Devil Z's unnatural speed and power. Based on the seinen manga by Kusunoki Michiharu, this thrilling anime follows Akio's quest for speed and glory on the Wangan Midnight.",
