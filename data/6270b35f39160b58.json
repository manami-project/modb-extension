  "synopsis": {
    "text": "It's the era of the shogunate in Japan, and the tranquility of Edo-era Tokyo is under threat. The city is besieged by colossal, mystical beasts conjured by a malevolent calligrapher with a score to settle. The shogunate's forces are no match for these creatures, leaving the city's fate hanging in the balance.\n\nEnter the 'Way of the Paper Drawing' clan, an ancient lineage of calligraphers with a unique ability: their drawings come alive. Led by the skilled Shirou Sumiya, the clan's members wield their brushes as weapons, creating anything from protective barriers to formidable monsters. Sumiya is called upon to aid the shogunate, accompanied by his gifted disciples, Shiro, Shimaki, and Ena. Each disciple possesses their own unique drawing technique, transforming their art into powerful combat tools.\n\nAs the city's last line of defense, the clan engages in a series of intense battles against the summoned creatures. But the true challenge lies ahead when they discover that the rogue calligrapher is not just any enemy, but someone they know all too well. With vengeance fueling his actions, the calligrapher's plans for retaliation are far from ordinary. Can the clan overcome their personal connection to the enemy and save the city from his monstrous schemes? Only time will tell as they draw their way to victory or defeat.",
