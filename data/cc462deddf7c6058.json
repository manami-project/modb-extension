  "synopsis": {
    "text": "The anime follows Mimori Togo and her friends, who are students at Sanshu Middle School. They unexpectedly gain magical powers and are tasked with fighting supernatural beings called Vertex in order to protect the Divine Tree. In battling these threats, the girls put their lives at risk, with some losing their bodily functions. Despite the hardships, the bonds between the friends grow stronger. After these events, a recap episode provides backstory connecting the original anime series to its sequel. It summarizes the journeys of the characters up to this point - how they met, obtained their powers, fought the Vertex, and coped with disabilities from using their full powers. The recap offers both longtime fans and newcomers a way to understand the emotional arc of the characters before the next season. Overall, the anime tells an uplifting yet bittersweet story about friendship, sacrifice and finding inner strength in the face of terrifying adversity. The recap episode allows viewers to look back on this emotional journey before the girlsâ€™ next chapter.",
