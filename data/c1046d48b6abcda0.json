  "synopsis": {
    "text": "In this special episode parodying 11 Eyes, Kakeru and his friends Yuko, Yukiko, Takahisa, and others find themselves transported to a bizarre pink-colored world unlike the Red Nights they are used to. Kakeru gains the ability to see through clothing, much to his dismay when it comes to Takahisa. Yuko can magically transform boys into girls. Misuzu's sword becomes an adult toy and she drives a bondage vehicle. The innocent Kukuri now only verbalizes and draws profanity. Without her glasses, Yukiko is oddly aroused. Takahisa's new power is shooting water from his finger. Their enemies also change - instead of Black Knights, they now face the ridiculous Pink Ero-Rangers. This comedic episode pokes fun at various 11 Eyes characters and plot points, with an erotic twist. But it ultimately has no bearing on the canonical storyline.",
