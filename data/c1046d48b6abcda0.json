  "synopsis": {
    "text": "Kakeru's ordinary school day takes an unexpected turn when he and his friends are transported to a world bathed in pink, marking the start of a special episode in the anime series. The rules of their new reality are far from ordinary, as Kakeru discovers his ability to see through clothing, while his companions experience their own bizarre transformations.\n\nIn this strange land, the once formidable Black Knights are now replaced by the risqu√© Pink Ero-Rangers. The team's powers have also undergone a peculiar metamorphosis, with Takahisa now able to shoot water from his finger and Misuzu wielding an 'adult toy' instead of her trusty sword.\n\nThe once mute Tachibana has gained the power of speech, while Yuka has the ability to transform boys into girls. Even the usually reserved Yukiko finds herself succumbing to uncharacteristic excitement when she removes her glasses.\n\nThis episode serves as a comedic parody, deviating from the original storyline and offering viewers a unique and entertaining twist on the characters and their abilities. The team must navigate this erotic and eccentric world, using their newfound powers to find a way back to their own reality.",
