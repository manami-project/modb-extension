    "text": "All Saints Street, a place where supernatural beings and humans coexist in harmony, becomes the new home for Neil Bowman, a demon with an unusual fascination for human culture. Neil, unlike his demonic counterparts, finds himself incapable of performing evil deeds, which leads him to escape Hell and move in with his online friend, the laid-back vampire Ira Blood.\n\nIn apartment 1031, Neil discovers that none of his roommates are actually human. Among them are the old-fashioned and strict angel landlord, Lynn, and her innocent younger sister, Lily, who has recently fallen from Heaven. The group also includes Vladimir, a werewolf tasked with keeping an eye on Neil, and Abu, a mysterious and silent mummy.\n\nUnbeknownst to Neil and his friends, the power of the Demon King lies dormant within him. As evil forces begin to close in, the question arises: Can Neil and his extraordinary roommates prevent an impending disaster and maintain their peaceful coexistence? This is the story of their ordinary lives, which are anything but ordinary.",
