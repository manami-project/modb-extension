This event follows the catastrophic 'Scorched Halloween' where an unidentified Strategic-Class magic destroyed a military city in the Korean Peninsula, sparking a global crisis. As Lina integrates into the group of friends led by Tatsuya Shiba, they gather for a farewell party for Shizuku amidst the festive Christmas season. Meanwhile, the USNA secretly deploys 'Stars' to uncover the truth behind the mysterious magic and its user. Coinciding with Lina's arrival, a series of bizarre incidents involving magicians drained of their blood begin to occur in Tokyo. Tatsuya and his sister Miyuki, along with their new ally Lina, must now unravel the identity of the enigmatic 'Vampire' and put an end to the sinister events plaguing the city.",
